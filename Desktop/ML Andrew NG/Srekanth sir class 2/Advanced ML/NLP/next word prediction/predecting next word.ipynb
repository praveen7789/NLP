       "'However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\n\"My dear Mr.\\nBennet.\"\\nsaid his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\"\\nMr.\\nBennet replied that he had not.\\n\"But it is.\"\\nreturned she; \"for Mrs.\\nLong has just been here, and she told me all about it.\"\\nMr.\\nBennet made no answer.\\n\"Do you not want to know who has taken it?\"\\ncried his wife impatiently.\\n\"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\"\\nThis was invitation enough.\\n\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.\\nLong says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr.\\nMorris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\"\\n\"What is his name?\"\\n\"Bingley.\"\\n\"Is he married or single?\"\\n\"Oh!\\nSingle, my dear, to be sure!\\nA single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.\\nWhat a fine thing for our girls.\"\\n\"How so?\\nHow can it affect them?\"\\n\"My dear Mr.\\nBennet.\"\\nreplied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome!\\nYou must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\n\"Design!\\nNonsense, how can you talk so!\\nBut it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\n\"I see no occasion for that.\\nYou and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr.\\nBingley may like you the best of the party.\"\\n\"My dear, you flatter me.\\nI certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\nWhen a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr.\\nBingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\n\"But consider your daughters.\\nOnly think what an establishment it would be for one of them.\\nSir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers.\\nIndeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not.\"\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely.\\nI dare say Mr.\\nBingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing.\\nLizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia.\\nBut you are always giving _her_ the preference.\"\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them.\"\\nreplied he; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nBennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way?\\nYou take delight in vexing me.\\nYou have no compassion for my poor nerves.\"\\n\"You mistake me, my dear.\\nI have a high respect for your nerves.\\nThey are my old friends.\\nI have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\\n\"Ah, you do not know what I suffer.\"\\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.\"\\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.\"\\nMr.\\nBennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.\\n_Her_ mind was less difficult to develop.\\nShe was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.\\nWhen she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\\nThe business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\nBennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\nBingley.\\nHe had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.\\nIt was then disclosed in the following manner.\\nObserving his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:  \"I hope Mr.\\nBingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\\n\"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr.\\nBingley likes.\"\\nsaid her mother resentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\\n\"But you forget, mamma.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs.\\nLong promised to introduce him.\"\\n\"I do not believe Mrs.\\nLong will do any such thing.\\nShe has two nieces of her own.\\nShe is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.\"\\n\"No more have I.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet; \"and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.\"\\nMrs.\\nBennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n\"Don\\'t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\\'s sake!\\nHave a little compassion on my nerves.\\nYou tear them to pieces.\"\\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs.\"\\nsaid her father; \"she times them ill.\"\\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement.\"\\nreplied Kitty fretfully.\\n\"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\\n\"Aye, so it is.\"\\ncried her mother, \"and Mrs.\\nLong does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\"\\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr.\\nBingley to _her_.\"\\n\"Impossible, Mr.\\nBennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?\"\\n\"I honour your circumspection.\\nA fortnight\\'s acquaintance is certainly very little.\\nOne cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.\\nBut if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.\\nLong and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\"\\nThe girls stared at their father.\\nMrs.\\nBennet said only, \"Nonsense, nonsense.\"\\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\"\\ncried he.\\n\"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?\\nI cannot quite agree with you _there_.\\nWhat say you, Mary?\\nFor you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.\"\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas.\"\\nhe continued, \"let us return to Mr.\\nBingley.\"\\n\"I am sick of Mr.\\nBingley.\"\\ncried his wife.\\n\"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before?\\nIf I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him.\\nIt is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.\\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.\\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr.\\nBennet!\\nBut I knew I should persuade you at last.\\nI was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.\\nWell, how pleased I am!\\nand it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.\"\\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\\n\"What an excellent father you have, girls.\"\\nsaid she, when the door was shut.\\n\"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.\\nAt our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything.\\nLydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr.\\nBingley will dance with you at the next ball.\"\\n\"Oh.\"\\nsaid Lydia stoutly, \"I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I\\'m the tallest.\"\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr.\\nBennet\\'s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.\\nBennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr.\\nBingley.\\nThey attacked him in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.\\nHer report was highly favourable.\\nSir William had been delighted with him.\\nHe was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.\\nNothing could be more delightful!\\nTo be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s heart were entertained.\\n\"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet to her husband, \"and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\"\\nIn a few days Mr.\\nBingley returned Mr.\\nBennet\\'s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.\\nHe had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.\\nThe ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs.\\nBennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.\\nMr.\\nBingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.\\nMrs.\\nBennet was quite disconcerted.\\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.\\nLady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr.\\nBingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\\nThe girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin.\\nAnd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether--Mr.\\nBingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\\nMr.\\nBingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.\\nHis sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.\\nHis brother-in-law, Mr.\\nHurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr.\\nDarcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.\\nThe gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr.\\nBingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.\\nMr.\\nBingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.\\nSuch amiable qualities must speak for themselves.\\nWhat a contrast between him and his friend!\\nMr.\\nDarcy danced only once with Mrs.\\nHurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\\nHis character was decided.\\nHe was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs.\\nBennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.\\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\\nDarcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\\nBingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\n\"Come, Darcy.\"\\nsaid he, \"I must have you dance.\\nI hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.\\nYou had much better dance.\"\\n\"I certainly shall not.\\nYou know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.\\nAt such an assembly as this it would be insupportable.\\nYour sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.\"\\n\"I would not be so fastidious as you are.\"\\ncried Mr.\\nBingley, \"for a kingdom!\\nUpon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.\"\\n\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n\"Oh!\\nShe is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!\\nBut there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable.\\nDo let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\\n\"Which do you mean?\"\\nand turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: \"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.\\nYou had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\\nMr.\\nBingley followed his advice.\\nMr.\\nDarcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.\\nShe told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\\nMrs.\\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.\\nMr.\\nBingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.\\nJane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\\nElizabeth felt Jane\\'s pleasure.\\nMary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.\\nThey returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.\\nThey found Mr.\\nBennet still up.\\nWith a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.\\nHe had rather hoped that his wife\\'s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.\\n\"Oh!\\nmy dear Mr.\\nBennet.\"\\nas she entered the room, \"we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.\\nI wish you had been there.\\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\nEverybody said how well she looked; and Mr.\\nBingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!\\nOnly think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her twice!\\nand she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.\\nFirst of all, he asked Miss Lucas.\\nI was so vexed to see him stand up with her!\\nBut, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.\\nSo he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.\\nThen the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_-.\"\\n\"If he had had any compassion for _me_.\"\\ncried her husband impatiently, \"he would not have danced half so much!\\nFor God\\'s sake, say no more of his partners.\\nOh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nmy dear, I am quite delighted with him.\\nHe is so excessively handsome!\\nAnd his sisters are charming women.\\nI never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.\\nI dare say the lace upon Mrs.\\nHurst\\'s gown-.\"\\nHere she was interrupted again.\\nMr.\\nBennet protested against any description of finery.\\nShe was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.\\nDarcy.\\n\"But I can assure you.\"\\nshe added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.\\nSo high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!\\nHe walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!\\nNot handsome enough to dance with!\\nI wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.\\nI quite detest the man.\"\\nBingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.\\n\"He is just what a young man ought to be.\"\\nsaid she, \"sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding.\"\\n\"He is also handsome.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.\\nHis character is thereby complete.\"\\n\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.\\nI did not expect such a compliment.\"\\n\"Did not you?\\nI did for you.\\nBut that is one great difference between us.\\nCompliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.\\nWhat could be more natural than his asking you again?\\nHe could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.\\nNo thanks to his gallantry for that.\\nWell, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.\\nYou have liked many a stupider person.\"\\n\"Dear Lizzy.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nyou are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\\nYou never see a fault in anybody.\\nAll the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.\\nI never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.\"\\n\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.\"\\n\"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.\\nWith _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!\\nAffectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it everywhere.\\nBut to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of everybody\\'s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.\\nAnd so you like this man\\'s sisters, too, do you?\\nTheir manners are not equal to his.\"\\n\"Certainly not--at first.\\nBut they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.\\nMiss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.\"\\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.\\nThey were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited.\\nThey were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.\\nThey were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother\\'s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\\nMr.\\nBingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.\\nMr.\\nBingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs.\\nHurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\nMr.\\nBingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.\\nHe did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character.\\nBingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.\\nOn the strength of Darcy\\'s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.\\nIn understanding, Darcy was the superior.\\nBingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.\\nHe was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\nIn that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.\\nBingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.\\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.\\nBingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\nDarcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.\\nMiss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.\\nMrs.\\nHurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\\nMiss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\\nSir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.\\nThe distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.\\nIt had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.\\nFor, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.\\nBy nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.\\nJames\\'s had made him courteous.\\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.\\nBennet.\\nThey had several children.\\nThe eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\\'s intimate friend.\\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\\n\"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.\\n\"_You_ were Mr.\\nBingley\\'s first choice.\"\\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nyou mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.\\nTo be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr.\\nRobinson.\"\\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr.\\nRobinson; did not I mention it to you?\\nMr.\\nRobinson\\'s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?\\nand his answering immediately to the last question: \\'Oh!\\nthe eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point..\"\\n\"Upon my word!\\nWell, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\"\\n\"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza.\"\\nsaid Charlotte.\\n\"Mr.\\nDarcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.\"\\n\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy\\'s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.\\nMrs.\\nLong told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.\"\\n\"Are you quite sure, ma\\'am?--is not there a little mistake?\"\\nsaid Jane.\\n\"I certainly saw Mr.\\nDarcy speaking to her.\"\\n\"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to.\"\\n\"Miss Bingley told me.\"\\nsaid Jane, \"that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances.\\nWith _them_ he is remarkably agreeable.\"\\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear.\\nIf he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs.\\nLong.\\nBut I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs.\\nLong does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\"\\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.\\nLong.\"\\nsaid Miss Lucas, \"but I wish he had danced with Eliza.\"\\n\"Another time, Lizzy.\"\\nsaid her mother, \"I would not dance with _him_, if I were you.\"\\n\"I believe, ma\\'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\"\\n\"His pride.\"\\nsaid Miss Lucas, \"does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.\\nOne cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself.\\nIf I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.\"\\n\"That is very true.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\"\\n\"Pride.\"\\nobserved Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe.\\nBy all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.\\nVanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously.\\nA person may be proud without being vain.\\nPride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\\n\"If I were as rich as Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\ncried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, \"I should not care how proud I was.\\nI would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.\"\\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.\"\\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\nThe visit was soon returned in due form.\\nMiss Bennet\\'s pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs.\\nHurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest.\\nBy Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother\\'s admiration.\\nIt was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.\\nShe mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\n\"It may perhaps be pleasant.\"\\nreplied Charlotte, \"to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.\\nIf a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.\\nThere is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.\\nWe can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.\\nIn nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_ affection than she feels.\\nBingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.\\nIf I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.\"\\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\\'s disposition as you do.\"\\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.\"\\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.\\nBut, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.\\nJane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention.\\nWhen she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\\n\"Your plan is a good one.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.\\nBut these are not Jane\\'s feelings; she is not acting by design.\\nAs yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.\\nShe has known him only a fortnight.\\nShe danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times.\\nThis is not quite enough to make her understand his character.\"\\n\"Not as you represent it.\\nHad she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.\"\\n\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nsaid Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.\\nHappiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.\\nIf the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.\\nThey always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\"\\n\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.\\nYou know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\"\\nOccupied in observing Mr.\\nBingley\\'s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.\\nMr.\\nDarcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.\\nBut no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.\\nTo this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\\nThough he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.\\nOf this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.\\nHis doing so drew her notice.\\nIt was at Sir William Lucas\\'s, where a large party were assembled.\\n\"What does Mr.\\nDarcy mean.\"\\nsaid she to Charlotte, \"by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\\n\"That is a question which Mr.\\nDarcy only can answer.\"\\n\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.\\nHe has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\"\\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:  \"Did you not think, Mr.\\nDarcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?\"\\n\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.\"\\n\"You are severe on us.\"\\n\"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased.\"\\nsaid Miss Lucas.\\n\"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\"\\n\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!\\nIf my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.\"\\nOn Miss Lucas\\'s persevering, however, she added, \"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\"\\nAnd gravely glancing at Mr.\\nDarcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: \\'Keep your breath to cool your porridge\\'; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.\\nAfter a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.\\nElizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.\\nMr.\\nDarcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:  \"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr.\\nDarcy!\\nThere is nothing like dancing after all.\\nI consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.\"\\n\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.\\nEvery savage can dance.\"\\nSir William only smiled.\\n\"Your friend performs delightfully.\"\\nhe continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\n\"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\"\\n\"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.\\nDo you often dance at St.\\nJames\\'s?\"\\n\"Never, sir.\"\\n\"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\"\\n\"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\"\\n\"You have a house in town, I conclude?\"\\nMr.\\nDarcy bowed.\\n\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\"\\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:  \"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?\\nMr.\\nDarcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.\\nYou cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\"\\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.\\nDarcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:  \"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.\\nI entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\"\\nMr.\\nDarcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain.\\nElizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\\n\"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nDarcy is all politeness.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, smiling.\\n\"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a partner?\"\\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away.\\nHer resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:  \"I can guess the subject of your reverie.\"\\n\"I should imagine not.\"\\n\"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.\\nI was never more annoyed!\\nThe insipidity, and yet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people!\\nWhat would I give to hear your strictures on them.\"\\n\"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.\\nMy mind was more agreeably engaged.\\nI have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\"\\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\\nMr.\\nDarcy replied with great intrepidity:  \"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\n\"Miss Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\nrepeated Miss Bingley.\\n\"I am all astonishment.\\nHow long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you joy?\"\\n\"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.\\nA lady\\'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.\\nI knew you would be wishing me joy.\"\\n\"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled.\\nYou will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\"\\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\nBennet\\'s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\\'s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.\\nHer father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\nShe had a sister married to a Mr.\\nPhillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner\\'s shop just over the way.\\nThe two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters\\', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.\\nAt present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.\\nTheir visits to Mrs.\\nPhillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.\\nEvery day added something to their knowledge of the officers\\' names and connections.\\nTheir lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.\\nMr.\\nPhillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.\\nThey could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\\nBingley\\'s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.\\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\nBennet coolly observed:  \"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.\\nI have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.\"\\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.\\n\"I am astonished, my dear.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet, \"that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.\\nIf I wished to think slightingly of anybody\\'s children, it should not be of my own, however.\"\\n\"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\"\\n\"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\"\\n\"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.\\nI had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.\"\\n\"My dear Mr.\\nBennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.\\nWhen they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\nI remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William\\'s in his regimentals.\"\\n\"Mamma.\"\\ncried Lydia, \"my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\\'s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\\'s library.\"\\nMrs.\\nBennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.\\nMrs.\\nBennet\\'s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,  \"Well, Jane, who is it from?\\nWhat is it about?\\nWhat does he say?\\nWell, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\"\\n\"It is from Miss Bingley.\"\\nsaid Jane, and then read it aloud.\\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND,--  \"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day\\'s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a quarrel.\\nCome as soon as you can on receipt of this.\\nMy brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,  \"CAROLINE BINGLE.\"\\n\"With the officers.\"\\ncried Lydia.\\n\"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_.\"\\n\"Dining out.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet, \"that is very unlucky.\"\\n\"Can I have the carriage?\"\\nsaid Jane.\\n\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\\n\"That would be a good scheme.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nbut the gentlemen will have Mr.\\nBingley\\'s chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\"\\n\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\\n\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\nThey are wanted in the farm, Mr.\\nBennet, are they not?\"\\n\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\\n\"But if you have got them to-day.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"my mother\\'s purpose will be answered.\"\\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.\\nJane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.\\nHer hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.\\nHer sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.\\nThe rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.\\n\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.\\nTill the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.\\nBreakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:  \"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--  \"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.\\nMy kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\\nThey insist also on my seeing Mr.\\nJones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.--Yours, etc.\"\\n\"Well, my dear.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr.\\nBingley, and under your orders.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nI am not afraid of her dying.\\nPeople do not die of little trifling colds.\\nShe will be taken good care of.\\nAs long as she stays there, it is all very well.\\nI would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\"\\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative.\\nShe declared her resolution.\\n\"How can you be so silly.\"\\ncried her mother, \"as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!\\nYou will not be fit to be seen when you get there.\"\\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\"\\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy.\"\\nsaid her father, \"to send for the horses?\"\\n\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk.\\nThe distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles.\\nI shall be back by dinner.\"\\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence.\"\\nobserved Mary, \"but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you.\"\\nsaid Catherine and Lydia.\\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.\\n\"If we make haste.\"\\nsaid Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers\\' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.\\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\\nThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.\\nHurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.\\nShe was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\\'s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.\\nMr.\\nDarcy said very little, and Mr.\\nHurst nothing at all.\\nThe former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion\\'s justifying her coming so far alone.\\nThe latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\nMiss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room.\\nElizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.\\nShe was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.\\nElizabeth silently attended her.\\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane.\\nThe apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.\\nThe advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.\\nElizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so.\\nMiss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\\nElizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.\\nTo the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s, she could not make a very favourable answer.\\nJane was by no means better.\\nThe sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\\nTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.\\nHis anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.\\nShe had very little notice from any but him.\\nMiss Bingley was engrossed by Mr.\\nDarcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.\\nHer manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty.\\nMrs.\\nHurst thought the same, and added:  \"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.\\nI shall never forget her appearance this morning.\\nShe really looked almost wild.\"\\n\"She did, indeed, Louisa.\\nI could hardly keep my countenance.\\nVery nonsensical to come at all!\\nWhy must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?\\nHer hair, so untidy, so blowsy.\"\\n\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.\"\\n\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa.\"\\nsaid Bingley; \"but this was all lost upon me.\\nI thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning.\\nHer dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\"\\n\"_You_ observed it, Mr.\\nDarcy, I am sure.\"\\nsaid Miss Bingley; \"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such an exhibition.\"\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!\\nWhat could she mean by it?\\nIt seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.\"\\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing.\"\\nsaid Bingley.\\n\"I am afraid, Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\nobserved Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\"\\n\"Not at all.\"\\nhe replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\"\\nA short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.\\nHurst began again:  \"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.\\nBut with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\"\\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.\"\\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\\n\"That is capital.\"\\nadded her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside.\"\\ncried Bingley, \"it would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world.\"\\nreplied Darcy.\\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend\\'s vulgar relations.\\nWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.\\nOn entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book.\\nMr.\\nHurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\"\\nsaid he; \"that is rather singular.\"\\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet.\"\\nsaid Miss Bingley, \"despises cards.\\nShe is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure.\"\\ncried Elizabeth; \"I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure.\"\\nsaid Bingley; \"and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.\"\\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying.\\nHe immediately offered to fetch her others--all that his library afforded.\\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into.\"\\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.\\n\"I am astonished.\"\\nsaid Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left so small a collection of books.\\nWhat a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\n\"It ought to be good.\"\\nhe replied, \"it has been the work of many generations.\"\\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.\"\\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.\"\\n\"Neglect!\\nI am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.\\nCharles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\\n\"I wish it may.\"\\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.\\nThere is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\\n\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr.\\nBingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\"\\nsaid Miss Bingley; \"will she be as tall as I am?\"\\n\"I think she will.\\nShe is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\\'s height, or rather taller.\"\\n\"How I long to see her again!\\nI never met with anybody who delighted me so much.\\nSuch a countenance, such manners!\\nAnd so extremely accomplished for her age!\\nHer performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\\n\"It is amazing to me.\"\\nsaid Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\\n\"All young ladies accomplished!\\nMy dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\\n\"Yes, all of them, I think.\\nThey all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses.\\nI scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\"\\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments.\"\\nsaid Darcy, \"has too much truth.\\nThe word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen.\\nBut I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.\\nI cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\\n\"Nor I, I am sure.\"\\nsaid Miss Bingley.\\n\"Then.\"\\nobserved Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.\"\\n\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\\n\"Oh!\\ncertainly.\"\\ncried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.\\nA woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.\"\\n\"All this she must possess.\"\\nadded Darcy, \"and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.\"\\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\"\\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?\"\\n\"I never saw such a woman.\\nI never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\"\\nMrs.\\nHurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr.\\nHurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.\\nAs all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\n\"Elizabeth Bennet.\"\\nsaid Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.\\nBut, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\\nreplied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, \"there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.\\nWhatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.\"\\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.\\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.\\nBingley urged Mr.\\nJones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.\\nThis she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother\\'s proposal; and it was settled that Mr.\\nJones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.\\nBingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.\\nThey solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\\nBingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.\\nIn spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation.\\nThe note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.\\nMrs.\\nBennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.\\nBennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.\\nShe would not listen, therefore, to her daughter\\'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.\\nAfter sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley\\'s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.\\nBingley met them with hopes that Mrs.\\nBennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\\n\"Indeed I have, sir.\"\\nwas her answer.\\n\"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.\\nMr.\\nJones says we must not think of moving her.\\nWe must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\"\\n\"Removed.\"\\ncried Bingley.\\n\"It must not be thought of.\\nMy sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\\n\"You may depend upon it, Madam.\"\\nsaid Miss Bingley, with cold civility, \"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.\"\\nMrs.\\nBennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n\"I am sure.\"\\nshe added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.\\nI often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_.\\nYou have a sweet room here, Mr.\\nBingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk.\\nI do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.\\nYou will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\"\\n\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry.\"\\nreplied he; \"and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.\\nAt present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\"\\n\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth.\\n\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\"\\ncried he, turning towards her.\\n\"Oh!\\nyes--I understand you perfectly.\"\\n\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\\n\"That is as it happens.\\nIt does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\\n\"Lizzy.\"\\ncried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\\n\"I did not know before.\"\\ncontinued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a studier of character.\\nIt must be an amusing study.\"\\n\"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.\\nThey have at least that advantage.\"\\n\"The country.\"\\nsaid Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study.\\nIn a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.\"\\n\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.\"\\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\\ncried Mrs.\\nBennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.\\n\"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.\"\\nEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.\\nMrs.\\nBennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places.\\nThe country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr.\\nBingley?\"\\n\"When I am in the country.\"\\nhe replied, \"I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.\\nThey have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\\n\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.\\nBut that gentleman.\"\\nlooking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing at all.\"\\n\"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.\\n\"You quite mistook Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nHe only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.\"\\n\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.\\nI know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\"\\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.\\nHis sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr.\\nDarcy with a very expressive smile.\\nElizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\\'s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\\n\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.\\nWhat an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr.\\nBingley, is not he?\\nSo much the man of fashion!\\nSo genteel and easy!\\nHe has always something to say to everybody.\\n_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\\n\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\\n\"No, she would go home.\\nI fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.\\nFor my part, Mr.\\nBingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up very differently.\\nBut everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.\\nIt is a pity they are not handsome!\\nNot that I think Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\\n\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\\n\"Oh!\\ndear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.\\nLady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane\\'s beauty.\\nI do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody better looking.\\nIt is what everybody says.\\nI do not trust my own partiality.\\nWhen she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner\\'s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\\nBut, however, he did not.\\nPerhaps he thought her too young.\\nHowever, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.\"\\n\"And so ended his affection.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth impatiently.\\n\"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.\\nI wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love.\"\\n\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love.\"\\nsaid Darcy.\\n\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.\\nEverything nourishes what is strong already.\\nBut if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.\\nShe longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr.\\nBingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.\\nMr.\\nBingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.\\nShe performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.\\nBennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.\\nUpon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.\\nThe two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.\\nBingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.\\nShe had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle\\'s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.\\nShe was very equal, therefore, to address Mr.\\nBingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.\\nHis answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother\\'s ear:  \"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball.\\nBut you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\"\\nLydia declared herself satisfied.\\n\"Oh!\\nyes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.\\nAnd when you have given _your_ ball.\"\\nshe added, \"I shall insist on their giving one also.\\nI shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\\nMrs.\\nBennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\\' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr.\\nDarcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley\\'s witticisms on _fine eyes_.\\nMrs.\\nHurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.\\nThe loo-table, however, did not appear.\\nMr.\\nDarcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.\\nMr.\\nHurst and Mr.\\nBingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\nHurst was observing their game.\\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.\\nThe perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.\\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter.\"\\nHe made no answer.\\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\\n\"You are mistaken.\\nI write rather slowly.\"\\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!\\nLetters of business, too!\\nHow odious I should think them.\"\\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\"\\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen.\\nLet me mend it for you.\\nI mend pens remarkably well.\"\\n\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\"\\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\\nHe was silent.\\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley\\'s.\"\\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?\\nAt present I have not room to do them justice.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nit is of no consequence.\\nI shall see her in January.\\nBut do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr.\\nDarcy?\"\\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.\"\\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.\"\\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline.\"\\ncried her brother, \"because he does _not_ write with ease.\\nHe studies too much for words of four syllables.\\nDo not you, Darcy?\"\\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\\n\"Oh.\"\\ncried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.\\nHe leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\\n\"Your humility, Mr.\\nBingley.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\\n\"Nothing is more deceitful.\"\\nsaid Darcy, \"than the appearance of humility.\\nIt is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.\"\\n\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\"\\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.\\nThe power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.\\nWhen you told Mrs.\\nBennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\"\\n\"Nay.\"\\ncried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.\\nAnd yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.\\nAt least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.\"\\n\"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.\\nYour conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, \\'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,\\' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and at another word, might stay a month.\"\\n\"You have only proved by this.\"\\ncried Elizabeth, \"that Mr.\\nBingley did not do justice to his own disposition.\\nYou have shown him off now much more than he did himself.\"\\n\"I am exceedingly gratified.\"\\nsaid Bingley, \"by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.\\nBut I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.\"\\n\"Would Mr.\\nDarcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.\"\\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.\\nAllowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.\"\\n\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you.\"\\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.\"\\n\"You appear to me, Mr.\\nDarcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.\\nA regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.\\nI am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.\\nBingley.\\nWe may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.\\nBut in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?\"\\n\"By all means.\"\\ncried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.\\nI assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.\\nI declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.\"\\nMr.\\nDarcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.\\nMiss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\n\"I see your design, Bingley.\"\\nsaid his friend.\\n\"You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.\"\\n\"Perhaps I do.\\nArguments are too much like disputes.\\nIf you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\\n\"What you ask.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.\"\\nMr.\\nDarcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music.\\nMiss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\nMrs.\\nHurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s eyes were fixed on her.\\nShe hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.\\nShe could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.\\nThe supposition did not pain her.\\nShe liked him too little to care for his approbation.\\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr.\\nDarcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her:  \"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?\"\\nShe smiled, but made no answer.\\nHe repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.\\n\"Oh.\"\\nsaid she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.\\nYou wanted me, I know, to say \\'Yes,\\' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.\\nI have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare.\"\\n\"Indeed I do not dare.\"\\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.\\nHe really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.\\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\\n\"I hope.\"\\nsaid she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, \"you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after officers.\\nAnd, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.\"\\n\"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\"\\n\"Oh!\\nyes.\\nDo let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.\\nPut them next to your great-uncle the judge.\\nThey are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines.\\nAs for your Elizabeth\\'s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\"\\n\"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.\"\\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs.\\nHurst and Elizabeth herself.\\n\"I did not know that you intended to walk.\"\\nsaid Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n\"You used us abominably ill.\"\\nanswered Mrs.\\nHurst, \"running away without telling us that you were coming out.\"\\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr.\\nDarcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.\\nThe path just admitted three.\\nMr.\\nDarcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:  \"This walk is not wide enough for our party.\\nWe had better go into the avenue.\"\\nBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered:  \"No, no; stay where you are.\\nYou are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage.\\nThe picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.\\nGood-bye.\"\\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.\\nJane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\\nTheir powers of conversation were considerable.\\nThey could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.\\nBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley\\'s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.\\nHe addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr.\\nHurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was \"very glad.\"\\nbut diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley\\'s salutation.\\nHe was full of joy and attention.\\nThe first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door.\\nHe then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.\\nElizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.\\nWhen tea was over, Mr.\\nHurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.\\nShe had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\\nDarcy did not wish for cards; and Mr.\\nHurst soon found even his open petition rejected.\\nShe assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.\\nMr.\\nHurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\nDarcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.\\nHurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother\\'s conversation with Miss Bennet.\\nMiss Bingley\\'s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.\\nShe could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.\\nAt length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!\\nI declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!\\nHow much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!\\nWhen I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.\"\\nNo one made any reply.\\nShe then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:  \"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?\\nI would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.\"\\n\"If you mean Darcy.\"\\ncried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.\"\\n\"I should like balls infinitely better.\"\\nshe replied, \"if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.\\nIt would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day.\"\\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.\"\\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room.\\nHer figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.\\nIn the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:  \"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.\\nI assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.\"\\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.\\nMiss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\nDarcy looked up.\\nHe was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.\\nHe was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.\\n\"What could he mean?\\nShe was dying to know what could be his meaning?\"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\\n\"Not at all.\"\\nwas her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.\"\\nMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr.\\nDarcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.\\n\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them.\"\\nsaid he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.\\n\"You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other\\'s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nshocking.\"\\ncried Miss Bingley.\\n\"I never heard anything so abominable.\\nHow shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\\n\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth.\\n\"We can all plague and punish one another.\\nTease him--laugh at him.\\nIntimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\\n\"But upon my honour, I do _not_.\\nI do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.\\nTease calmness of manner and presence of mind!\\nNo, no; I feel he may defy us there.\\nAnd as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.\\nMr.\\nDarcy may hug himself.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nDarcy is not to be laughed at.\"\\ncried Elizabeth.\\n\"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances.\\nI dearly love a laugh.\"\\n\"Miss Bingley.\"\\nsaid he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\\nThe wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth--\"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_.\\nI hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.\\nFollies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.\\nBut these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.\"\\n\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.\\nBut it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.\"\\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.\\nBut pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\"\\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n\"Your examination of Mr.\\nDarcy is over, I presume.\"\\nsaid Miss Bingley; \"and pray what is the result?\"\\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr.\\nDarcy has no defect.\\nHe owns it himself without disguise.\"\\n\"No.\"\\nsaid Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension.\\nI have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.\\nMy temper I dare not vouch for.\\nIt is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.\\nI cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself.\\nMy feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.\\nMy temper would perhaps be called resentful.\\nMy good opinion once lost, is lost forever.\"\\n\"_That_ is a failing indeed.\"\\ncried Elizabeth.\\n\"Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character.\\nBut you have chosen your fault well.\\nI really cannot _laugh_ at it.\\nYou are safe from me.\"\\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\\n\"And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.\"\\n\"And yours.\"\\nhe replied with a smile, \"is willfully to misunderstand them.\"\\n\"Do let us have a little music.\"\\ncried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.\\n\"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr.\\nHurst?\"\\nHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments\\' recollection, was not sorry for it.\\nHe began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\\nBut Mrs.\\nBennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane\\'s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.\\nHer answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth\\'s wishes, for she was impatient to get home.\\nMrs.\\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr.\\nBingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.\\nAgainst staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr.\\nBingley\\'s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.\\nMiss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\nTo Mr.\\nDarcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.\\nShe attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.\\nHe wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.\\nSteady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.\\nMiss Bingley\\'s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.\\nElizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.\\nThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.\\nMrs.\\nBennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.\\nBut their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.\\nThe evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\nThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to.\\nCatherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.\\nMuch had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, \"that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.\"\\n\"Who do you mean, my dear?\\nI know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.\\nI do not believe she often sees such at home.\"\\n\"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\"\\nMrs.\\nBennet\\'s eyes sparkled.\\n\"A gentleman and a stranger!\\nIt is Mr.\\nBingley, I am sure!\\nWell, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.\\nBingley.\\nBut--good Lord!\\nhow unlucky!\\nThere is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.\\nLydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this moment.\"\\n\"It is _not_ Mr.\\nBingley.\"\\nsaid her husband; \"it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.\"\\nThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.\\nAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:  \"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.\\nIt is from my cousin, Mr.\\nCollins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nmy dear.\"\\ncried his wife, \"I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\\nPray do not talk of that odious man.\\nI do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\"\\nJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\nThey had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.\\nBennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\\n\"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet, \"and nothing can clear Mr.\\nCollins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.\"\\n\"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.\\nI hate such false friends.\\nWhy could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?\"\\n\"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.\"\\n\"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.\\n\"Dear Sir,--  \"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--\\'There, Mrs.\\nBennet.\\'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.\\nAs a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.\\nI cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends--but of this hereafter.\\nIf you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\\'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\\'ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,  \"WILLIAM COLLIN.\"\\n\"At four o\\'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet, as he folded up the letter.\\n\"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.\"\\n\"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.\"\\n\"Though it is difficult.\"\\nsaid Jane, \"to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.\"\\nElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\n\"He must be an oddity, I think.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"I cannot make him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?\"\\n\"No, my dear, I think not.\\nI have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.\\nThere is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.\\nI am impatient to see him.\"\\n\"In point of composition.\"\\nsaid Mary, \"the letter does not seem defective.\\nThe idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.\"\\nTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.\\nIt was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.\\nAs for their mother, Mr.\\nCollins\\'s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.\\nMr.\\nCollins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.\\nMr.\\nBennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr.\\nCollins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.\\nHe was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty.\\nHis air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.\\nHe had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.\\nBennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.\\nThis gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\\nBennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.\\n\"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough.\\nThings are settled so oddly.\"\\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\\n\"Ah!\\nsir, I do indeed.\\nIt is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.\\nNot that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.\\nThere is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\"\\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.\\nBut I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.\\nAt present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted-.\"\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.\\nThey were not the only objects of Mr.\\nCollins\\'s admiration.\\nThe hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.\\nThe dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing.\\nBut he was set right there by Mrs.\\nBennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.\\nHe begged pardon for having displeased her.\\nIn a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\nBennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.\\nLady Catherine de Bourgh\\'s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.\\nMr.\\nBennet could not have chosen better.\\nMr.\\nCollins was eloquent in her praise.\\nThe subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that \"he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.\\nShe had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.\\nShe had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.\\nLady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.\\nShe had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\"\\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet, \"and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.\\nIt is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.\\nDoes she live near you, sir?\"\\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"\\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir?\\nHas she any family?\"\\n\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.\"\\n\"Ah.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than many girls.\\nAnd what sort of young lady is she?\\nIs she handsome?\"\\n\"She is a most charming young lady indeed.\\nLady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\nShe is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.\\nBut she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\\n\"Has she been presented?\\nI do not remember her name among the ladies at court.\"\\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.\\nHer ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.\\nI have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.\\nThese are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.\"\\n\"You judge very properly.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet, \"and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.\\nMay I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?\"\\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\\nMr.\\nBennet\\'s expectations were fully answered.\\nHis cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\nBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr.\\nBennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.\\nMr.\\nCollins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.\\nKitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.\\nOther books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce\\'s Sermons.\\nLydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:  \"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.\\nMy aunt told me so herself on Saturday.\\nI shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr.\\nDenny comes back from town.\"\\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:  \"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.\\nIt amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.\\nBut I will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\\nThen turning to Mr.\\nBennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.\\nMr.\\nBennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.\\nMrs.\\nBennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia\\'s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr.\\nCollins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr.\\nBennet, and prepared for backgammon.\\nCollins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.\\nThe subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.\\nA fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\\nHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father\\'s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.\\nHis plan did not vary on seeing them.\\nMiss Bennet\\'s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice.\\nThe next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour\\'s tete-a-tete with Mrs.\\nBennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.\\n\"As to her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"\\nMr.\\nCollins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs.\\nBennet was stirring the fire.\\nElizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\\nMrs.\\nBennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.\\nLydia\\'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr.\\nCollins was to attend them, at the request of Mr.\\nBennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr.\\nCollins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.\\nSuch doings discomposed Mr.\\nBennet exceedingly.\\nIn his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr.\\nCollins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr.\\nCollins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.\\nIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.\\nThe attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him.\\nTheir eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.\\nBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way.\\nThe officer was the very Mr.\\nDenny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.\\nAll were struck with the stranger\\'s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot.\\nMr.\\nDenny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr.\\nWickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.\\nThis was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\\nHis appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\\nThe introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.\\nOn distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.\\nBingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.\\nHe was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.\\nMr.\\nDarcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\\nBoth changed colour, one looked white, the other red.\\nMr.\\nWickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr.\\nDarcy just deigned to return.\\nWhat could be the meaning of it?\\nIt was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\nIn another minute, Mr.\\nBingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\nMr.\\nDenny and Mr.\\nWickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr.\\nPhillip\\'s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia\\'s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\\nPhillips\\'s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.\\nMrs.\\nPhillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr.\\nJones\\'s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr.\\nCollins by Jane\\'s introduction of him.\\nShe received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.\\nMrs.\\nPhillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr.\\nDenny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant\\'s commission in the ----shire.\\nShe had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.\\nWickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid, disagreeable fellows.\"\\nSome of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.\\nThis was agreed to, and Mrs.\\nPhillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.\\nThe prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.\\nMr.\\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\\nAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\nMr.\\nCollins on his return highly gratified Mrs.\\nBennet by admiring Mrs.\\nPhillips\\'s manners and politeness.\\nHe protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.\\nSomething, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.\\nCollins\\'s scruples of leaving Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nBennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr.\\nWickham had accepted their uncle\\'s invitation, and was then in the house.\\nWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.\\nPhillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper\\'s room.\\nIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\nPhillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.\\nTo the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.\\nIt was over at last, however.\\nThe gentlemen did approach, and when Mr.\\nWickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.\\nThe officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr.\\nWickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\\nMr.\\nWickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.\\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr.\\nWickham and the officers, Mr.\\nCollins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.\\nPhillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\nWhen the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\n\"I know little of the game at present.\"\\nsaid he, \"but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life-.\"\\nMrs.\\nPhillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\\nMr.\\nWickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.\\nAt first there seemed danger of Lydia\\'s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr.\\nWickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nShe dared not even mention that gentleman.\\nHer curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved.\\nMr.\\nWickham began the subject himself.\\nHe inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr.\\nDarcy had been staying there.\\n\"About a month.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nreplied Mr.\\nWickham; \"his estate there is a noble one.\\nA clear ten thousand per annum.\\nYou could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.\"\\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.\\nAre you much acquainted with Mr.\\nDarcy?\"\\n\"As much as I ever wish to be.\"\\ncried Elizabeth very warmly.\\n\"I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.\"\\n\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion.\"\\nsaid Wickham, \"as to his being agreeable or otherwise.\\nI am not qualified to form one.\\nI have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.\\nIt is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.\\nBut I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.\\nHere you are in your own family.\"\\n\"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.\\nHe is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.\\nEverybody is disgusted with his pride.\\nYou will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.\"\\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry.\"\\nsaid Wickham, after a short interruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.\\nThe world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\"\\n\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.\"\\nWickham only shook his head.\\n\"I wonder.\"\\nsaid he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.\"\\n\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.\\nI hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nno--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nIf _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.\\nWe are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr.\\nDarcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr.\\nDarcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.\\nHis behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.\"\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\\nMr.\\nWickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.\\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society.\"\\nhe added, \"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.\\nI knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.\\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me.\\nI have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.\\nI _must_ have employment and society.\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.\\nThe church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\"\\n\"Indeed.\"\\n\"Yes--the late Mr.\\nDarcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.\\nHe was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\\nI cannot do justice to his kindness.\\nHe meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.\"\\n\"Good heavens.\"\\ncried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be?\\nHow could his will be disregarded?\\nWhy did you not seek legal redress?\"\\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.\\nA man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr.\\nDarcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing.\\nCertain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it.\\nI have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.\\nI can recall nothing worse.\\nBut the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.\"\\n\"This is quite shocking!\\nHe deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\\n\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.\\nTill I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\n\"But what.\"\\nsaid she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?\\nWhat can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.\\nHad the late Mr.\\nDarcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\\'s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life.\\nHe had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me.\"\\n\"I had not thought Mr.\\nDarcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him.\\nI had not thought so very ill of him.\\nI had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.\"\\nAfter a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.\\nHis disposition must be dreadful.\"\\n\"I will not trust myself on the subject.\"\\nreplied Wickham; \"I can hardly be just to him.\"\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father.\"\\nShe could have added, \"A young man, too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented herself with, \"and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner.\"\\n\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.\\n_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr.\\nPhillips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr.\\nDarcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.\\nHe was most highly esteemed by Mr.\\nDarcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.\\nMr.\\nDarcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father\\'s death, Mr.\\nDarcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\"\\n\"How strange.\"\\ncried Elizabeth.\\n\"How abominable!\\nI wonder that the very pride of this Mr.\\nDarcy has not made him just to you!\\nIf from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for dishonesty I must call it.\"\\n\"It _is_ wonderful.\"\\nreplied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\nIt has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling.\\nBut we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.\"\\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\\n\"Yes.\\nIt has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.\\nFamily pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what his father was--have done this.\\nNot to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.\\nHe has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.\"\\n\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\\nHe shook his head.\\n\"I wish I could call her amiable.\\nIt gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.\\nBut she is too much like her brother--very, very proud.\\nAs a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.\\nBut she is nothing to me now.\\nShe is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished.\\nSince her father\\'s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.\"\\nAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:  \"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr.\\nBingley!\\nHow can Mr.\\nBingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?\\nHow can they suit each other?\\nDo you know Mr.\\nBingley?\"\\n\"Not at all.\"\\n\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.\\nHe cannot know what Mr.\\nDarcy is.\"\\n\"Probably not; but Mr.\\nDarcy can please where he chooses.\\nHe does not want abilities.\\nHe can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.\\nAmong those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.\\nHis pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something for fortune and figure.\"\\nThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr.\\nCollins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs.\\nPhillips.\\nThe usual inquiries as to his success was made by the latter.\\nIt had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.\\nPhillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.\\n\"I know very well, madam.\"\\nsaid he, \"that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.\\nThere are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\"\\nMr.\\nWickham\\'s attention was caught; and after observing Mr.\\nCollins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"\\nshe replied, \"has very lately given him a living.\\nI hardly know how Mr.\\nCollins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\n\"No, indeed, I did not.\\nI knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\\'s connections.\\nI never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.\"\\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.\\nVain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another.\\n\"Mr.\\nCollins.\"\\nsaid she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree.\"\\nreplied Wickham; \"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.\\nShe has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\"\\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\\nWickham\\'s attentions.\\nThere could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.\\nPhillips\\'s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody.\\nWhatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.\\nElizabeth went away with her head full of him.\\nShe could think of nothing but of Mr.\\nWickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr.\\nCollins were once silent.\\nLydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr.\\nCollins in describing the civility of Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nPhillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\\nWickham and herself.\\nJane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr.\\nDarcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.\\nThe possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.\\n\"They have both.\"\\nsaid she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.\\nInterested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.\\nIt is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.\"\\n\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?\\nDo clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.\"\\n\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.\\nMy dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr.\\nDarcy, to be treating his father\\'s favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for.\\nIt is impossible.\\nNo man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.\\nCan his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?\\nOh!\\nno.\"\\n\"I can much more easily believe Mr.\\nBingley\\'s being imposed on, than that Mr.\\nWickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.\\nIf it be not so, let Mr.\\nDarcy contradict it.\\nBesides, there was truth in his looks.\"\\n\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.\\nOne does not know what to think.\"\\n\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"\\nBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr.\\nBingley, if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.\\nThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr.\\nBingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.\\nThe two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.\\nTo the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.\\nBennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.\\nThey were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s civilities.\\nThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.\\nMrs.\\nBennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr.\\nBingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.\\nJane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s look and behaviour.\\nThe happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr.\\nWickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.\\nAnd even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.\\n\"While I can have my mornings to myself.\"\\nsaid she, \"it is enough--I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.\"\\nElizabeth\\'s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr.\\nCollins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr.\\nBingley\\'s invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening\\'s amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\n\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you.\"\\nsaid he, \"that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"\\nElizabeth felt herself completely taken in.\\nShe had fully proposed being engaged by Mr.\\nWickham for those very dances; and to have Mr.\\nCollins instead!\\nher liveliness had never been worse timed.\\nThere was no help for it, however.\\nMr.\\nWickham\\'s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr.\\nCollins\\'s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.\\nShe was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more.\\nIt now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_.\\nElizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.\\nMr.\\nCollins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.\\nNo aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.\\nEven Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr.\\nWickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\nWickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.\\nThe certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.\\nShe had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.\\nBut in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s pleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, \"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"\\nThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham\\'s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\\nAttendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.\\nShe was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr.\\nBingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\\nBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.\\nThe first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.\\nMr.\\nCollins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.\\nThe moment of her release from him was ecstasy.\\nShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\nWhen those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr.\\nDarcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.\\nHe walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:  \"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"\\n\"Heaven forbid!\\n_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\nTo find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!\\nDo not wish me such an evil.\"\\nWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence.\\nElizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.\\nDarcy, and reading in her neighbours\\' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it.\\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.\\nHe replied, and was again silent.\\nAfter a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:--\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nI talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\"\\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.\\n\"Very well.\\nThat reply will do for the present.\\nPerhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.\\nBut _now_ we may be silent.\"\\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\\n\"Sometimes.\\nOne must speak a little, you know.\\nIt would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\\n\"Both.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.\\nWe are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.\\n_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\\nHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.\\nShe answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.\"\\nThe effect was immediate.\\nA deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.\\nAt length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, \"Mr.\\nWickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain.\"\\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.\"\\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.\\nAt that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\\nDarcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.\\n\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.\\nSuch very superior dancing is not often seen.\\nIt is evident that you belong to the first circles.\\nAllow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place.\\nWhat congratulations will then flow in!\\nI appeal to Mr.\\nDarcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\\nYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William\\'s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\nRecovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.\"\\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all.\\nSir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\\nWe have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\\n\"What think you of books?\"\\nsaid he, smiling.\\n\"Books--oh!\\nno.\\nI am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.\"\\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.\\nWe may compare our different opinions.\"\\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.\"\\n\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\"\\nsaid he, with a look of doubt.\\n\"Yes, always.\"\\nshe replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr.\\nDarcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.\\nYou are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_.\"\\n\"I am.\"\\nsaid he, with a firm voice.\\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\\n\"I hope not.\"\\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.\"\\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\\n\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character.\"\\nsaid she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.\\n\"I am trying to make it out.\"\\n\"And what is your success?\"\\nShe shook her head.\\n\"I do not get on at all.\\nI hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\\n\"I can readily believe.\"\\nanswered he gravely, \"that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.\"\\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours.\"\\nhe coldly replied.\\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy\\'s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.\\nThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:  \"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s steward.\\nLet me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr.\\nDarcy in a most infamous manner.\\nI do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr.\\nDarcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\\nHis coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.\\nI pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\\n\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\"\\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\\nreplied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\n\"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\"\\n\"Insolent girl.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth to herself.\\n\"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.\\nI see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\nShe then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.\\nJane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane\\'s being in the fairest way for happiness.\\n\"I want to know.\"\\nsaid she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr.\\nWickham.\\nBut perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\"\\n\"No.\"\\nreplied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.\\nMr.\\nBingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr.\\nDarcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr.\\nWickham has deserved much less attention from Mr.\\nDarcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\\'s, Mr.\\nWickham is by no means a respectable young man.\\nI am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s regard.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nBingley does not know Mr.\\nWickham himself?\"\\n\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\\n\"This account then is what he has received from Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nI am satisfied.\\nBut what does he say of the living?\"\\n\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr.\\nDarcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\"\\n\"I have not a doubt of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s sincerity.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth warmly; \"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.\\nMr.\\nBingley\\'s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.\"\\nShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\\nElizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.\\nOn their being joined by Mr.\\nBingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr.\\nCollins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.\\n\"I have found out.\"\\nsaid he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.\\nI happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.\\nHow wonderfully these sort of things occur!\\nWho would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!\\nI am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.\\nMy total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\\n\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\n\"Indeed I am.\\nI shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine\\'s _nephew_.\\nIt will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\\'nnight.\"\\nElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr.\\nDarcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr.\\nDarcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.\\nMr.\\nCollins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:  \"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.\\nYou must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.\\nPardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.\"\\nAnd with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.\\nHer cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words \"apology.\"\\n\"Hunsford.\"\\nand \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"\\nIt vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.\\nMr.\\nDarcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr.\\nCollins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.\\nMr.\\nCollins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.\\nMr.\\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.\\n\"I have no reason, I assure you.\"\\nsaid he, \"to be dissatisfied with my reception.\\nMr.\\nDarcy seemed much pleased with the attention.\\nHe answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine\\'s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.\\nIt was really a very handsome thought.\\nUpon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\\nAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\nBingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.\\nShe saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley\\'s two sisters.\\nHer mother\\'s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.\\nWhen they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr.\\nBingley.\\nIt was an animating subject, and Mrs.\\nBennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.\\nHis being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.\\nIt was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\\'s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.\\nIt was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\\nBennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life.\\nShe concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\\nIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\\'s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr.\\nDarcy, who sat opposite to them.\\nHer mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\\n\"What is Mr.\\nDarcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?\\nI am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower.\\nWhat advantage can it be for you to offend Mr.\\nDarcy?\\nYou will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.\"\\nNothing that she could say, however, had any influence.\\nHer mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\nElizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.\\nShe could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr.\\nDarcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.\\nThe expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.\\nAt length, however, Mrs.\\nBennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\\nElizabeth now began to revive.\\nBut not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.\\nBy many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\nElizabeth\\'s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\\nMary\\'s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.\\nElizabeth was in agonies.\\nShe looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.\\nShe looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave.\\nShe looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.\\nHe took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \"That will do extremely well, child.\\nYou have delighted us long enough.\\nLet the other young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\\nMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father\\'s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.\\nOthers of the party were now applied to.\\n\"If I.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nCollins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.\\nI do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.\\nThe rector of a parish has much to do.\\nIn the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.\\nHe must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.\\nAnd I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.\\nI cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.\"\\nAnd with a bow to Mr.\\nDarcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.\\nMany stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\\nBennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr.\\nCollins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\\nTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.\\nThat his two sisters and Mr.\\nDarcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\nThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement.\\nShe was teased by Mr.\\nCollins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.\\nIn vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\\nHe assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.\\nThere was no arguing upon such a project.\\nShe owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr.\\nCollins\\'s conversation to herself.\\nShe was at least free from the offense of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.\\nShe felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\nWickham, and rejoiced in it.\\nThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs.\\nBennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.\\nMrs.\\nHurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.\\nThey repulsed every attempt of Mrs.\\nBennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr.\\nCollins, who was complimenting Mr.\\nBingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.\\nDarcy said nothing at all.\\nMr.\\nBennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\\nMr.\\nBingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.\\nElizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.\\nHurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord, how tired I am.\"\\naccompanied by a violent yawn.\\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.\\nBennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr.\\nBingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.\\nBingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.\\nMrs.\\nBennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.\\nOf having another daughter married to Mr.\\nCollins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr.\\nBingley and Netherfield.\\nMr.\\nCollins made his declaration in form.\\nHaving resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business.\\nOn finding Mrs.\\nBennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:  \"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?\"\\nBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\nBennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!--yes--certainly.\\nI am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.\\nCome, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\"\\nAnd, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:  \"Dear madam, do not go.\\nI beg you will not go.\\nMr.\\nCollins must excuse me.\\nHe can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.\\nI am going away myself.\"\\n\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.\\nI desire you to stay where you are.\"\\nAnd upon Elizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.\\nCollins.\"\\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment\\'s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.\\nMrs.\\nBennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr.\\nCollins began.\\n\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.\\nYou would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother\\'s permission for this address.\\nYou can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.\\nAlmost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life.\\nBut before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\\nThe idea of Mr.\\nCollins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued:  \"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.\\nTwice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.\\nJenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh\\'s footstool, that she said, \\'Mr.\\nCollins, you must marry.\\nA clergyman like you must marry.\\nChoose properly, choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.\\nThis is my advice.\\nFind such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\\' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.\\nYou will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.\\nThus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women.\\nBut the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.\\nThis has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.\\nAnd now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.\\nTo fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother\\'s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.\\nOn that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\\nIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n\"You are too hasty, sir.\"\\nshe cried.\\n\"You forget that I have made no answer.\\nLet me do it without further loss of time.\\nAccept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.\\nI am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\"\\n\"I am not now to learn.\"\\nreplied Mr.\\nCollins, with a formal wave of the hand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time.\\nI am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\\n\"Upon my word, sir.\"\\ncried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration.\\nI do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.\\nI am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\nYou could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so.\\nNay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.\"\\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nCollins very gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.\\nAnd you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\"\\n\"Indeed, Mr.\\nCollins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.\\nYou must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.\\nI wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.\\nThis matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\"\\nAnd rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr.\\nCollins not thus addressed her:  \"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.\"\\n\"Really, Mr.\\nCollins.\"\\ncried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me exceedingly.\\nIf what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.\"\\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.\\nMy reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.\\nMy situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.\\nYour portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.\\nAs I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.\\nI would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.\\nI thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.\\nMy feelings in every respect forbid it.\\nCan I speak plainer?\\nDo not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\"\\n\"You are uniformly charming.\"\\ncried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.\"\\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\nCollins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs.\\nBennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.\\nMr.\\nCollins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\\nThis information, however, startled Mrs.\\nBennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\n\"But, depend upon it, Mr.\\nCollins.\"\\nshe added, \"that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.\\nI will speak to her about it directly.\\nShe is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will _make_ her know it.\"\\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam.\"\\ncried Mr.\\nCollins; \"but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.\\nIf therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet, alarmed.\\n\"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.\\nIn everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.\\nI will go directly to Mr.\\nBennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh!\\nMr.\\nBennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr.\\nCollins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\"\\nMr.\\nBennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.\\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you.\"\\nsaid he, when she had finished her speech.\\n\"Of what are you talking?\"\\n\"Of Mr.\\nCollins and Lizzy.\\nLizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\nCollins, and Mr.\\nCollins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?\\nIt seems an hopeless business.\"\\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.\\nTell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\"\\n\"Let her be called down.\\nShe shall hear my opinion.\"\\nMrs.\\nBennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.\\n\"Come here, child.\"\\ncried her father as she appeared.\\n\"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.\\nI understand that Mr.\\nCollins has made you an offer of marriage.\\nIs it true?\"\\nElizabeth replied that it was.\\n\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\\n\"I have, sir.\"\\n\"Very well.\\nWe now come to the point.\\nYour mother insists upon your accepting it.\\nIs it not so, Mrs.\\nBennet?\"\\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.\\nFrom this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.\\nYour mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr.\\nCollins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.\"\\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs.\\nBennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\\n\"What do you mean, Mr.\\nBennet, in talking this way?\\nYou promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.\"\\n\"My dear.\"\\nreplied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request.\\nFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.\\nI shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.\"\\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.\\nBennet give up the point.\\nShe talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.\\nShe endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks.\\nThough her manner varied, however, her determination never did.\\nMr.\\nCollins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\\nHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.\\nHis regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\\'s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\nWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.\\nShe was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!\\nWhat do you think has happened this morning?\\nMr.\\nCollins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"\\nCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs.\\nBennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.\\n\"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas.\"\\nshe added in a melancholy tone, \"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me.\\nI am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.\"\\nCharlotte\\'s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n\"Aye, there she comes.\"\\ncontinued Mrs.\\nBennet, \"looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.\\nBut I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.\\nI shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you.\\nI have done with you from this very day.\\nI told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.\\nI have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.\\nNot that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.\\nPeople who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.\\nNobody can tell what I suffer!\\nBut it is always so.\\nThose who do not complain are never pitied.\"\\nHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation.\\nShe talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.\\nCollins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, \"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr.\\nCollins have a little conversation together.\"\\nElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.\\nCollins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.\\nIn a doleful voice Mrs.\\nBennet began the projected conversation: \"Oh!\\nMr.\\nCollins.\"\\n\"My dear madam.\"\\nreplied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this point.\\nFar be it from me.\"\\nhe presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter.\\nResignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.\\nPerhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\\nYou will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter\\'s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr.\\nBennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\\nMy conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter\\'s lips instead of your own.\\nBut we are all liable to error.\\nI have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\\nMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\"\\nCollins\\'s offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother.\\nAs for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.\\nHe scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.\\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s ill-humour or ill health.\\nMr.\\nCollins was also in the same state of angry pride.\\nElizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.\\nHe was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.\\nAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.\\nWickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\\nHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt\\'s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over.\\nTo Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\\n\"I found.\"\\nsaid he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr.\\nDarcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.\"\\nShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.\\nHis accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\\nSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield.\\nThe envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\\'s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\\'s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\\nJane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.\\nWhen they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:  \"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again.\\nYou shall hear what she says.\"\\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\\nHurst had a house.\\nThe next was in these words: \"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.\\nI depend on you for that.\"\\nTo these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr.\\nBingley\\'s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\\n\"It is unlucky.\"\\nsaid she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\nBut may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?\\nMr.\\nBingley will not be detained in London by them.\"\\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.\\nI will read it to you.\"\\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.\\nMany of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of that I despair.\\nI sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\"\\n\"It is evident by this.\"\\nadded Jane, \"that he comes back no more this winter.\"\\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\"\\n\"Why will you think so?\\nIt must be his own doing.\\nHe is his own master.\\nBut you do not know _all_.\\nI _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.\\nI will have no reserves from _you_.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nDarcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.\\nI really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister.\\nI do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.\\nMy brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister\\'s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\\'s heart.\\nWith all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\"\\n\"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"\\nsaid Jane as she finished it.\\n\"Is it not clear enough?\\nDoes it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\\'s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?\\nCan there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.\\nWill you hear it?\"\\n\"Most willingly.\"\\n\"You shall have it in a few words.\\nMiss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\nShe follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.\"\\nJane shook her head.\\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.\\nNo one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection.\\nMiss Bingley, I am sure, cannot.\\nShe is not such a simpleton.\\nCould she have seen half as much love in Mr.\\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.\\nBut the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.\\nBut, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley.\"\\nreplied Jane, \"your representation of all this might make me quite easy.\\nBut I know the foundation is unjust.\\nCaroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.\"\\n\"That is right.\\nYou could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.\\nBelieve her to be deceived, by all means.\\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?\"\\n\"You must decide for yourself.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\"\\n\"How can you talk so?\"\\nsaid Jane, faintly smiling.\\n\"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.\"\\n\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.\"\\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.\\nA thousand things may arise in six months.\"\\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.\\nIt appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline\\'s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\\nJane\\'s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\nThey agreed that Mrs.\\nBennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman\\'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.\\nAfter lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\\nCollins.\\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.\\n\"It keeps him in good humour.\"\\nsaid she, \"and I am more obliged to you than I can express.\"\\nCharlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.\\nThis was very amiable, but Charlotte\\'s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr.\\nCollins\\'s addresses, by engaging them towards herself.\\nSuch was Miss Lucas\\'s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\\nBut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.\\nHe was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\\nHis reception, however, was of the most flattering kind.\\nMiss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.\\nBut little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\\nIn as short a time as Mr.\\nCollins\\'s long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.\\nThe stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.\\nSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.\\nMr.\\nCollins\\'s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.\\nLady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr.\\nBennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr.\\nCollins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.\\nJames\\'s.\\nThe whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.\\nThe younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\\'s dying an old maid.\\nCharlotte herself was tolerably composed.\\nShe had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.\\nHer reflections were in general satisfactory.\\nMr.\\nCollins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.\\nBut still he would be her husband.\\nWithout thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.\\nThis preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.\\nThe least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.\\nElizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.\\nShe resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr.\\nCollins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.\\nA promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.\\nAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.\\nBennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them.\\n\"My dear madam.\"\\nhe replied, \"this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.\"\\nThey were all astonished; and Mr.\\nBennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:  \"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation here, my good sir?\\nYou had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.\"\\n\"My dear sir.\"\\nreplied Mr.\\nCollins, \"I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"\\n\"You cannot be too much upon your guard.\\nRisk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\"\\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.\\nAs for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.\"\\nWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return.\\nMrs.\\nBennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion.\\nBut on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.\\nMiss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\\nThe possibility of Mr.\\nCollins\\'s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:  \"Engaged to Mr.\\nCollins!\\nMy dear Charlotte--impossible.\"\\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:  \"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?\\nDo you think it incredible that Mr.\\nCollins should be able to procure any woman\\'s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\\n\"I see what you are feeling.\"\\nreplied Charlotte.\\n\"You must be surprised, very much surprised--so lately as Mr.\\nCollins was wishing to marry you.\\nBut when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.\\nI am not romantic, you know; I never was.\\nI ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.\\nCollins\\'s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\"\\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly.\"\\nand after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\\nCharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\\nIt was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.\\nThe strangeness of Mr.\\nCollins\\'s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.\\nShe had always felt that Charlotte\\'s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.\\nCharlotte the wife of Mr.\\nCollins was a most humiliating picture!\\nAnd to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.\\nWith many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.\\nBennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:  \"Good Lord!\\nSir William, how can you tell such a story?\\nDo not you know that Mr.\\nCollins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William\\'s good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr.\\nCollins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\nMrs.\\nBennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.\\nIn the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.\\nCollins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.\\nTwo inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.\\nNothing could console and nothing could appease her.\\nNor did that day wear out her resentment.\\nA week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.\\nMr.\\nBennet\\'s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!\\nJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.\\nKitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr.\\nCollins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\nLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs.\\nBennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.\\nBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.\\nHer disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.\\nJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\nThe promised letter of thanks from Mr.\\nCollins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\\'s abode in the family might have prompted.\\nAfter discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.\\nMr.\\nCollins\\'s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.\\nBennet.\\nOn the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.\\nIt was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.\\nShe hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.\\nSuch were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.\\nBennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s continued absence.\\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.\\nDay after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\\nEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\nUnwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\\'s happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring.\\nThe united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.\\nAs for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth\\'s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.\\nBut as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used.\\nIt needed all Jane\\'s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\\nMr.\\nCollins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.\\nHe was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.\\nThe chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\\nMrs.\\nBennet was really in a most pitiable state.\\nThe very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.\\nThe sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.\\nAs her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.\\nWhenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr.\\nCollins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr.\\nBennet were dead.\\nShe complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\n\"Indeed, Mr.\\nBennet.\"\\nsaid she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it.\"\\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.\\nLet us hope for better things.\\nLet us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\"\\nThis was not very consoling to Mrs.\\nBennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.\\n\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.\\nIf it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\"\\n\"What should not you mind?\"\\n\"I should not mind anything at all.\"\\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\"\\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr.\\nBennet, for anything about the entail.\\nHow anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\\'s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.\\nCollins too!\\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\"\\n\"I leave it to yourself to determine.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet.\\nThe very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother\\'s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.\\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.\\nMiss Darcy\\'s praise occupied the chief of it.\\nHer many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.\\nShe wrote also with great pleasure of her brother\\'s being an inmate of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.\\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.\\nHer heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.\\nTo Caroline\\'s assertion of her brother\\'s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.\\nThat he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination.\\nHad his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister\\'s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.\\nIt was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.\\nShe could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley\\'s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends\\' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane\\'s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister\\'s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying:  \"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!\\nShe can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.\\nBut I will not repine.\\nIt cannot last long.\\nHe will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.\"\\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.\\n\"You doubt me.\"\\ncried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you have no reason.\\nHe may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.\\nI have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.\\nThank God!\\nI have not _that_ pain.\\nA little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\"\\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\\n\"My dear Jane.\"\\nexclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.\\nYour sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.\\nI feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.\"\\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister\\'s warm affection.\\n\"Nay.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"this is not fair.\\n_You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.\\nI only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.\\nDo not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.\\nYou need not.\\nThere are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.\\nThe more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.\\nI have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte\\'s marriage.\\nIt is unaccountable!\\nIn every view it is unaccountable.\"\\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.\\nThey will ruin your happiness.\\nYou do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.\\nConsider Mr.\\nCollins\\'s respectability, and Charlotte\\'s steady, prudent character.\\nRemember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\\'s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.\"\\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.\\nMy dear Jane, Mr.\\nCollins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking.\\nYou shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.\\nYou shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.\"\\n\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both.\"\\nreplied Jane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together.\\nBut enough of this.\\nYou alluded to something else.\\nYou mentioned _two_ instances.\\nI cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.\\nWe must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.\\nWe must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.\\nIt is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.\\nWomen fancy admiration means more than it does.\"\\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\"\\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s conduct to design.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.\\nThoughtlessness, want of attention to other people\\'s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.\"\\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\\n\"Yes; to the last.\\nBut if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.\\nStop me whilst you can.\"\\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\\n\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\\n\"I cannot believe it.\\nWhy should they try to influence him?\\nThey can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.\"\\n\"Your first position is false.\\nThey may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.\"\\n\"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy.\"\\nreplied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.\\nThey have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.\\nBut, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother\\'s.\\nWhat sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?\\nIf they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.\\nBy supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.\\nDo not distress me by the idea.\\nI am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.\\nLet me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\nBingley\\'s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\nMrs.\\nBennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.\\nHer daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.\\nMrs.\\nBennet\\'s best comfort was that Mr.\\nBingley must be down again in the summer.\\nMr.\\nBennet treated the matter differently.\\n\"So, Lizzy.\"\\nsaid he one day, \"your sister is crossed in love, I find.\\nI congratulate her.\\nNext to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.\\nIt is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.\\nWhen is your turn to come?\\nYou will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.\\nNow is your time.\\nHere are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.\\nLet Wickham be _your_ man.\\nHe is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\\n\"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.\\nWe must not all expect Jane\\'s good fortune.\"\\n\"True.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it.\"\\nMr.\\nWickham\\'s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.\\nThey saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.\\nThe whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr.\\nDarcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr.\\nDarcy before they had known anything of the matter.\\nMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr.\\nDarcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\nCollins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.\\nThe pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.\\nHe took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.\\nOn the following Monday, Mrs.\\nBennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.\\nMr.\\nGardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.\\nThe Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.\\nBennet and Mrs.\\nPhillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.\\nBetween the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.\\nThey had frequently been staying with her in town.\\nThe first part of Mrs.\\nGardiner\\'s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.\\nWhen this was done she had a less active part to play.\\nIt became her turn to listen.\\nMrs.\\nBennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.\\nThey had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.\\nTwo of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\n\"I do not blame Jane.\"\\nshe continued, \"for Jane would have got Mr.\\nBingley if she could.\\nBut Lizzy!\\nOh, sister!\\nIt is very hard to think that she might have been Mr.\\nCollins\\'s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness.\\nHe made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.\\nThe consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.\\nThe Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.\\nThey are all for what they can get.\\nI am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.\\nIt makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.\\nHowever, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.\"\\nMrs.\\nGardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\\'s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.\\nWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.\\n\"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"I am sorry it went off.\\nBut these things happen so often!\\nA young man, such as you describe Mr.\\nBingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\"\\n\"An excellent consolation in its way.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"but it will not do for _us_.\\nWe do not suffer by _accident_.\\nIt does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.\"\\n\"But that expression of \\'violently in love\\' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.\\nIt is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\\'s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.\\nPray, how _violent was_ Mr.\\nBingley\\'s love?\"\\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.\\nEvery time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.\\nAt his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.\\nCould there be finer symptoms?\\nIs not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\\n\"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\nPoor Jane!\\nI am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.\\nIt had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\nBut do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?\\nChange of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.\"\\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister\\'s ready acquiescence.\\n\"I hope.\"\\nadded Mrs.\\nGardiner, \"that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.\\nWe live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\"\\n\"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr.\\nDarcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London!\\nMy dear aunt, how could you think of it?\\nMr.\\nDarcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month\\'s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr.\\nBingley never stirs without him.\"\\n\"So much the better.\\nI hope they will not meet at all.\\nBut does not Jane correspond with his sister?\\n_She_ will not be able to help calling.\"\\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\\nBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\\'s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.\\nIt was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\\'s attractions.\\nMiss Bennet accepted her aunt\\'s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline\\'s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.\\nThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.\\nMrs.\\nBennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.\\nWhen the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it--of which officers Mr.\\nWickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.\\nGardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\\'s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both.\\nWithout supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\nTo Mrs.\\nGardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.\\nAbout ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged.\\nThey had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy\\'s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr.\\nDarcy by character perfectly well.\\nHere consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.\\nIn comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.\\nOn being made acquainted with the present Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman\\'s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr.\\nFitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\\nGardiner\\'s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:  \"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.\\nSeriously, I would have you be on your guard.\\nDo not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.\\nI have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.\\nBut as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you.\\nYou have sense, and we all expect you to use it.\\nYour father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.\\nYou must not disappoint your father.\"\\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.\\nI will take care of myself, and of Mr.\\nWickham too.\\nHe shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.\"\\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\\n\"I beg your pardon, I will try again.\\nAt present I am not in love with Mr.\\nWickham; no, I certainly am not.\\nBut he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not.\\nI see the imprudence of it.\\nOh!\\n_that_ abominable Mr.\\nDarcy!\\nMy father\\'s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.\\nMy father, however, is partial to Mr.\\nWickham.\\nIn short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?\\nAll that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.\\nI will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.\\nWhen I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.\\nIn short, I will do my best.\"\\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often.\\nAt least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\"\\n\"As I did the other day.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth with a conscious smile: \"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.\\nBut do not imagine that he is always here so often.\\nIt is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.\\nYou know my mother\\'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.\\nBut really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.\"\\nHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.\\nMr.\\nCollins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\nBennet.\\nHis marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \"_wished_ they might be happy.\"\\nThursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\\'s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.\\nAs they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:  \"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\"\\n\"_That_ you certainly shall.\"\\n\"And I have another favour to ask you.\\nWill you come and see me?\"\\n\"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\"\\n\"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.\\nPromise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.\"\\nElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.\\n\"My father and Maria are coming to me in March.\"\\nadded Charlotte, \"and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\\nIndeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\"\\nThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual.\\nElizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.\\nElizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.\\nCharlotte\\'s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.\\nShe wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.\\nThe house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\\'s behaviour was most friendly and obliging.\\nIt was Mr.\\nCollins\\'s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.\\nJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\nHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.\\nJane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.\\nShe accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.\\n\"My aunt.\"\\nshe continued, \"is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\"\\nShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\\n\"I did not think Caroline in spirits.\"\\nwere her words, \"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.\\nI was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her.\\nI inquired after their brother, of course.\\nHe was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\nDarcy that they scarcely ever saw him.\\nI found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.\\nI wish I could see her.\\nMy visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.\\nHurst were going out.\\nI dare say I shall see them soon here.\"\\nElizabeth shook her head over this letter.\\nIt convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr.\\nBingley her sister\\'s being in town.\\nFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.\\nShe endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\\'s inattention.\\nAfter waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.\\nThe letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.\\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\\'s regard for me.\\nBut, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.\\nI do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.\\nCaroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime.\\nWhen she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.\\nI pity, though I cannot help blaming her.\\nShe was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side.\\nBut I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.\\nI need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable.\\nI cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.\\nHe knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.\\nI cannot understand it.\\nIf I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.\\nBut I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.\\nLet me hear from you very soon.\\nMiss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.\\nWe had better not mention it.\\nI am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.\\nPray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.\\nI am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.\"\\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\\nAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.\\nShe would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\nHis character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s sister, as by Wickham\\'s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.\\nHis apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\nElizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\\nHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.\\nThe sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte\\'s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\\nNothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.\\nAll this was acknowledged to Mrs.\\nGardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: \"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.\\nBut my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.\\nI cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.\\nThere can be no love in all this.\\nMy watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\\nImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.\\nKitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.\\nThey are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\"\\nMarch was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.\\nShe had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.\\nAbsence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.\\nCollins.\\nThere was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.\\nThe journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.\\nEverything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte\\'s first sketch.\\nShe was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.\\nThe improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.\\nThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\\nThe farewell between herself and Mr.\\nWickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.\\nHis present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.\\nHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.\\nSir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.\\nElizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William\\'s too long.\\nHe could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.\\nIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.\\nAs they drove to Mr.\\nGardiner\\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.\\nOn the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin\\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.\\nAll was joy and kindness.\\nThe day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\nElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.\\nTheir first object was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.\\nIt was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\\'s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham\\'s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.\\n\"But my dear Elizabeth.\"\\nshe added, \"what sort of girl is Miss King?\\nI should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?\\nWhere does discretion end, and avarice begin?\\nLast Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\"\\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.\"\\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.\\nI know no harm of her.\"\\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\\'s death made her mistress of this fortune.\"\\n\"No--why should he?\\nIf it were not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?\"\\n\"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.\"\\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.\\nIf _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?\"\\n\"_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_.\\nIt only shows her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\ncried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose.\\n_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.\"\\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.\\nI should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nif that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.\\nI am sick of them all.\\nThank Heaven!\\nI am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.\\nStupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.\"\\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\"\\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\\n\"We have not determined how far it shall carry us.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nGardiner, \"but, perhaps, to the Lakes.\"\\nNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.\\n\"Oh, my dear, dear aunt.\"\\nshe rapturously cried, \"what delight!\\nwhat felicity!\\nYou give me fresh life and vigour.\\nAdieu to disappointment and spleen.\\nWhat are young men to rocks and mountains?\\nOh!\\nwhat hours of transport we shall spend!\\nAnd when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything.\\nWe _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.\\nLakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation.\\nLet _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.\"\\nWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\\nThe palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.\\nElizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\\nAt length the Parsonage was discernible.\\nThe garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving.\\nMr.\\nCollins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.\\nIn a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.\\nMrs.\\nCollins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received.\\nShe saw instantly that her cousin\\'s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family.\\nThey were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife\\'s offers of refreshment.\\nElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.\\nBut though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.\\nWhen Mr.\\nCollins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.\\nOnce or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.\\nAfter sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\nCollins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.\\nTo work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\nHere, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.\\nHe could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.\\nBut of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.\\nIt was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\nFrom his garden, Mr.\\nCollins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband\\'s help.\\nIt was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.\\nWhen Mr.\\nCollins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte\\'s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.\\nShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.\\nIt was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr.\\nCollins joining in, observed:  \"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.\\nShe is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.\\nI have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.\\nHer behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.\\nWe dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.\\nHer ladyship\\'s carriage is regularly ordered for us.\\nI _should_ say, one of her ladyship\\'s carriages, for she has several.\"\\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed.\"\\nadded Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.\\nShe is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte\\'s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.\\nShe had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\nCollins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.\\nA lively imagination soon settled it all.\\nAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.\\nShe opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out--  \"Oh, my dear Eliza!\\npray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!\\nI will not tell you what it is.\\nMake haste, and come down this moment.\"\\nElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.\\n\"And is this all?\"\\ncried Elizabeth.\\n\"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter.\"\\n\"La!\\nmy dear.\"\\nsaid Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is not Lady Catherine.\\nThe old lady is Mrs.\\nJenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh.\\nOnly look at her.\\nShe is quite a little creature.\\nWho would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\"\\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\\nWhy does she not come in?\"\\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.\\nIt is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\\n\"I like her appearance.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\n\"She looks sickly and cross.\\nYes, she will do for him very well.\\nShe will make him a very proper wife.\"\\nMr.\\nCollins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\\'s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.\\nMr.\\nCollins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\nCollins\\'s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\\nThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine\\'s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\\n\"I confess.\"\\nsaid he, \"that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship\\'s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.\\nI rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.\\nBut who could have foreseen such an attention as this?\\nWho could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival.\"\\n\"I am the less surprised at what has happened.\"\\nreplied Sir William, \"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\nAbout the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\"\\nScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings.\\nMr.\\nCollins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\\nWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--  \"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.\\nLady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.\\nI would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more.\\nLady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.\\nShe likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.\"\\nWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\nSuch formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St.\\nJames\\'s.\\nAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.\\nEvery park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr.\\nCollins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\nWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria\\'s alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\\nElizabeth\\'s courage did not fail her.\\nShe had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.\\nFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr.\\nCollins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.\\nJenkinson were sitting.\\nHer ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.\\nCollins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\\nIn spite of having been at St.\\nJames\\'s Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.\\nElizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.\\nLady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.\\nHer air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.\\nShe was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.\\nWickham immediately to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.\\nWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr.\\nDarcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria\\'s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.\\nThere was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies.\\nMiss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.\\nJenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.\\nAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr.\\nCollins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\nThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr.\\nCollins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship\\'s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.\\nHe carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.\\nThe party did not supply much conversation.\\nElizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.\\nMrs.\\nJenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.\\nMaria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\nWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted.\\nShe inquired into Charlotte\\'s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.\\nElizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady\\'s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.\\nIn the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.\\nCollins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.\\nCollins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.\\nShe asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother\\'s maiden name?\\nElizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly.\\nLady Catherine then observed,  \"Your father\\'s estate is entailed on Mr.\\nCollins, I think.\\nFor your sake.\"\\nturning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.\\nIt was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\\'s family.\\nDo you play and sing, Miss Bennet?\"\\n\"A little.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nthen--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.\\nOur instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day.\\nDo your sisters play and sing?\"\\n\"One of them does.\"\\n\"Why did not you all learn?\\nYou ought all to have learned.\\nThe Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours.\\nDo you draw?\"\\n\"No, not at all.\"\\n\"What, none of you?\"\\n\"Not one.\"\\n\"That is very strange.\\nBut I suppose you had no opportunity.\\nYour mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\"\\n\"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\"\\n\"Has your governess left you?\"\\n\"We never had any governess.\"\\n\"No governess!\\nHow was that possible?\\nFive daughters brought up at home without a governess!\\nI never heard of such a thing.\\nYour mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\"\\nElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case.\\n\"Then, who taught you?\\nwho attended to you?\\nWithout a governess, you must have been neglected.\"\\n\"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means.\\nWe were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\nThose who chose to be idle, certainly might.\"\\n\"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.\\nI always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.\\nIt is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.\\nI am always glad to get a young person well placed out.\\nFour nieces of Mrs.\\nJenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.\\nMrs.\\nCollins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf\\'s calling yesterday to thank me?\\nShe finds Miss Pope a treasure.\\n\\'Lady Catherine,\\' said she, \\'you have given me a treasure.\\' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\"\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, all.\"\\n\"All!\\nWhat, all five out at once?\\nVery odd!\\nAnd you only the second.\\nThe younger ones out before the elder ones are married!\\nYour younger sisters must be very young?\"\\n\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.\\nPerhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company.\\nBut really, ma\\'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.\\nThe last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first.\\nAnd to be kept back on _such_ a motive!\\nI think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\\n\"Upon my word.\"\\nsaid her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.\\nPray, what is your age?\"\\n\"With three younger sisters grown up.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, smiling, \"your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\"\\nLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\n\"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.\"\\n\"I am not one-and-twenty.\"\\nWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed.\\nLady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nCollins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.\\nJenkinson to make up her party.\\nTheir table was superlatively stupid.\\nScarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.\\nJenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh\\'s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.\\nA great deal more passed at the other table.\\nLady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.\\nMr.\\nCollins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\\nSir William did not say much.\\nHe was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.\\nWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.\\nCollins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.\\nThe party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.\\nFrom these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\\nCollins\\'s side and as many bows on Sir William\\'s they departed.\\nAs soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte\\'s sake, she made more favourable than it really was.\\nBut her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr.\\nCollins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship\\'s praise into his own hands.\\nWhile Sir William was with them, Mr.\\nCollins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road.\\nThe room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\\nElizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr.\\nCollins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\nFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr.\\nCollins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.\\nShe not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes\\' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.\\nVery few days passed in which Mr.\\nCollins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.\\nNow and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.\\nShe examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.\\nCollins\\'s joints of meat were too large for her family.\\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr.\\nCollins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.\\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.\\nTheir other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr.\\nCollins\\'s reach.\\nThis, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.\\nHer favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine\\'s curiosity.\\nIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\\nEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.\\nElizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr.\\nDarcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\\'s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr.\\nCollins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.\\nOn the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.\\nThere were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr.\\nDarcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr.\\nCollins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.\\nCharlotte had seen them from her husband\\'s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:  \"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.\\nMr.\\nDarcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.\\nColonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.\\nMr.\\nDarcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs.\\nCollins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.\\nElizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs.\\nCollins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.\\nShe answered him in the usual way, and after a moment\\'s pause, added:  \"My eldest sister has been in town these three months.\\nHave you never happened to see her there?\"\\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.\\nThe subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\nIt was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen\\'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.\\nFor the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter.\\nColonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\nDarcy they had seen only at church.\\nThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine\\'s drawing-room.\\nHer ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.\\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.\\nCollins\\'s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.\\nHe now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr.\\nDarcy.\\n_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:  \"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?\\nWhat is it you are talking of?\\nWhat are you telling Miss Bennet?\\nLet me hear what it is.\"\\n\"We are speaking of music, madam.\"\\nsaid he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.\\n\"Of music!\\nThen pray speak aloud.\\nIt is of all subjects my delight.\\nI must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.\\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.\\nIf I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.\\nAnd so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.\\nI am confident that she would have performed delightfully.\\nHow does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\\nMr.\\nDarcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister\\'s proficiency.\\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her.\"\\nsaid Lady Catherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.\"\\n\"I assure you, madam.\"\\nhe replied, \"that she does not need such advice.\\nShe practises very constantly.\"\\n\"So much the better.\\nIt cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.\\nI often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice.\\nI have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\\nJenkinson\\'s room.\\nShe would be in nobody\\'s way, you know, in that part of the house.\"\\nMr.\\nDarcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\\'s ill-breeding, and made no answer.\\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.\\nHe drew a chair near her.\\nLady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer\\'s countenance.\\nElizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:  \"You mean to frighten me, Mr.\\nDarcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?\\nI will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.\\nThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.\\nMy courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.\"\\n\"I shall not say you are mistaken.\"\\nhe replied, \"because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.\"\\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.\\nI am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.\\nIndeed, Mr.\\nDarcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\\n\"I am not afraid of you.\"\\nsaid he, smilingly.\\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of.\"\\ncried Colonel Fitzwilliam.\\n\"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\\n\"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\\nThe first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?\\nHe danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.\\nMr.\\nDarcy, you cannot deny the fact.\"\\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.\"\\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.\\nWell, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?\\nMy fingers wait your orders.\"\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\nsaid Darcy, \"I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\\n\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.\\n\"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?\"\\n\"I can answer your question.\"\\nsaid Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to him.\\nIt is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess.\"\\nsaid Darcy, \"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\nI cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.\"\\n\"My fingers.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women\\'s do.\\nThey have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.\\nBut then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the trouble of practising.\\nIt is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman\\'s of superior execution.\"\\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right.\\nYou have employed your time much better.\\nNo one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.\\nWe neither of us perform to strangers.\"\\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.\\nElizabeth immediately began playing again.\\nLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:  \"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.\\nShe has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne\\'s.\\nAnne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\\nElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin\\'s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\\'s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.\\nElizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship\\'s carriage was ready to take them all home.\\nCollins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.\\nAs she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr.\\nDarcy, and Mr.\\nDarcy only, entered the room.\\nHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within.\\nThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.\\nIt was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:  \"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.\\nDarcy!\\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.\\nBingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.\\nHe and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\"\\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added:  \"I think I have understood that Mr.\\nBingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?\"\\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future.\\nHe has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.\"\\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.\\nBut, perhaps, Mr.\\nBingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.\"\\n\"I should not be surprised.\"\\nsaid Darcy, \"if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\\nElizabeth made no answer.\\nShe was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\nHe took the hint, and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable house.\\nLady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\\nCollins first came to Hunsford.\"\\n\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nCollins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\"\\n\"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.\\nMy friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr.\\nCollins as the wisest thing she ever did.\\nShe seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\\n\"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.\"\\n\"An easy distance, do you call it?\\nIt is nearly fifty miles.\"\\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road?\\nLittle more than half a day\\'s journey.\\nYes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.\"\\n\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match.\"\\ncried Elizabeth.\\n\"I should never have said Mrs.\\nCollins was settled _near_ her family.\"\\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\\nAnything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\"\\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:  \"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.\\nThe far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.\\nWhere there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.\\nBut that is not the case _here_.\\nMr.\\nand Mrs.\\nCollins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.\"\\nMr.\\nDarcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.\\n_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn.\"\\nElizabeth looked surprised.\\nThe gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:  \"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk.\\nThe tete-a-tete surprised them.\\nMr.\\nDarcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\n\"What can be the meaning of this?\"\\nsaid Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.\\n\"My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way.\"\\nBut when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte\\'s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.\\nAll field sports were over.\\nWithin doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\nThey called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.\\nIt was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.\\nBut why Mr.\\nDarcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.\\nIt could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.\\nHe seldom appeared really animated.\\nMrs.\\nCollins knew not what to make of him.\\nColonel Fitzwilliam\\'s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.\\nShe watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.\\nHe certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.\\nIt was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend\\'s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.\\nHe was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.\\nDarcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\\nDarcy.\\nShe felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.\\nHow it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!\\nYet it did, and even a third.\\nIt seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.\\nHe never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nCollins\\'s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.\\nHis words seemed to imply it.\\nCould he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?\\nShe supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.\\nIt distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.\\nShe was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\\'s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.\\nDarcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.\\nPutting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:  \"I did not know before that you ever walked this way.\"\\n\"I have been making the tour of the park.\"\\nhe replied, \"as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.\\nAre you going much farther?\"\\n\"No, I should have turned in a moment.\"\\nAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.\\n\"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.\\nBut I am at his disposal.\\nHe arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice.\\nI do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\n\"He likes to have his own way very well.\"\\nreplied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\\n\"But so we all do.\\nIt is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.\\nI speak feelingly.\\nA younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\"\\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.\\nNow seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?\\nWhen have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\"\\n\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.\\nBut in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.\\nYounger sons cannot marry where they like.\"\\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\"\\n\"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\"\\n\"Is this.\"\\nthought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\"\\nand she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what is the usual price of an earl\\'s younger son?\\nUnless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.\\nTo interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:  \"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal.\\nI wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.\\nBut, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\"\\n\"No.\"\\nsaid Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must divide with me.\\nI am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\\n\"Are you indeed?\\nAnd pray what sort of guardians do you make?\\nDoes your charge give you much trouble?\\nYoung ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\"\\nAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.\\nShe directly replied:  \"You need not be frightened.\\nI never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\nShe is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.\\nHurst and Miss Bingley.\\nI think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\\n\"I know them a little.\\nTheir brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he is a great friend of Darcy\\'s.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nyes.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth drily; \"Mr.\\nDarcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\\n\"Care of him!\\nYes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.\\nFrom something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.\\nBut I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.\\nIt was all conjecture.\"\\n\"What is it you mean?\"\\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady\\'s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.\"\\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.\\nWhat he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\\n\"Did Mr.\\nDarcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.\"\\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts.\"\\nsaid Fitzwilliam, smiling.\\n\"He only told me what I have now told you.\"\\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.\\nAfter watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.\\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"Your cousin\\'s conduct does not suit my feelings.\\nWhy was he to be the judge?\"\\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\\n\"I do not see what right Mr.\\nDarcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend\\'s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.\\nBut.\"\\nshe continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.\\nIt is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.\"\\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise.\"\\nsaid Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin\\'s triumph very sadly.\"\\nThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr.\\nDarcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.\\nThere, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.\\nIt was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.\\nThere could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr.\\nDarcy could have such boundless influence.\\nThat he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.\\nIf his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.\\nHe had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\n\"There were some very strong objections against the lady.\"\\nwere Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.\\n\"To Jane herself.\"\\nshe exclaimed, \"there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.\\nNeither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr.\\nDarcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.\"\\nWhen she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\\nDarcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend\\'s connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.\\nBingley for his sister.\\nThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr.\\nDarcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.\\nMrs.\\nCollins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr.\\nCollins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine\\'s being rather displeased by her staying at home.\\nDarcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.\\nThey contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\nElizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.\\nMr.\\nDarcy\\'s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister\\'s sufferings.\\nIt was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.\\nShe could not think of Darcy\\'s leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.\\nBut this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr.\\nDarcy walk into the room.\\nIn an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\\nShe answered him with cold civility.\\nHe sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\\nElizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.\\nAfter a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:  \"In vain I have struggled.\\nIt will not do.\\nMy feelings will not be repressed.\\nYou must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.\"\\nElizabeth\\'s astonishment was beyond expression.\\nShe stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.\\nThis he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed.\\nHe spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.\\nHis sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.\\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man\\'s affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.\\nShe tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.\\nHe concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.\\nAs he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.\\nHe _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.\\nSuch a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:  \"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.\\nIt is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.\\nBut I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.\\nI am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.\\nIt has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.\\nThe feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.\"\\nMr.\\nDarcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.\\nHis complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.\\nHe was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it.\\nThe pause was to Elizabeth\\'s feelings dreadful.\\nAt length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:  \"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\\nI might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.\\nBut it is of small importance.\"\\n\"I might as well inquire.\"\\nreplied she, \"why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\\nWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?\\nBut I have other provocations.\\nYou know I have.\\nHad not my feelings decided against you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?\"\\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr.\\nDarcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued:  \"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.\\nNo motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.\\nYou dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.\"\\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\"\\nshe repeated.\\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.\\nTowards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself.\"\\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\\n\"But it is not merely this affair.\"\\nshe continued, \"on which my dislike is founded.\\nLong before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided.\\nYour character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr.\\nWickham.\\nOn this subject, what can you have to say?\\nIn what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\\nor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman\\'s concerns.\"\\nsaid Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?\"\\n\"His misfortunes.\"\\nrepeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.\"\\n\"And of your infliction.\"\\ncried Elizabeth with energy.\\n\"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty.\\nYou have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him.\\nYou have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.\\nYou have done all this!\\nand yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.\"\\n\"And this.\"\\ncried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, \"is your opinion of me!\\nThis is the estimation in which you hold me!\\nI thank you for explaining it so fully.\\nMy faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!\\nBut perhaps.\"\\nadded he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, \"these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.\\nThese bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything.\\nBut disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\\nNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.\\nThey were natural and just.\\nCould you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:  \"You are mistaken, Mr.\\nDarcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\"\\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:  \"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.\"\\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.\\nShe went on:  \"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\\n\"You have said quite enough, madam.\\nI perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.\"\\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\\nThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.\\nShe knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour.\\nHer astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.\\nThat she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr.\\nDarcy!\\nThat he should have been in love with her for so many months!\\nSo much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend\\'s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case--was almost incredible!\\nIt was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.\\nBut his pride, his abominable pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.\\nWickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.\\nShe continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine\\'s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte\\'s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\nShe could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise.\\nShe was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road.\\nThe park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.\\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.\\nThe five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.\\nShe was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.\\nDarcy, she was directly retreating.\\nBut the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.\\nShe had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr.\\nDarcy, she moved again towards the gate.\\nHe had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, \"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\\nWill you do me the honour of reading that letter?\"\\nAnd then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\\nWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.\\nThe envelope itself was likewise full.\\nPursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.\\nIt was dated from Rosings, at eight o\\'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--  \"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you.\\nI write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.\\nYou must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.\\n\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.\\nThe first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr.\\nBingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr.\\nWickham.\\nWilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.\\nBut from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.\\nIf, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry.\\nThe necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\\n\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country.\\nBut it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.\\nI had often seen him in love before.\\nAt that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\\'s accidental information, that Bingley\\'s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\\nHe spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\nFrom that moment I observed my friend\\'s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.\\nYour sister I also watched.\\nHer look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening\\'s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.\\nIf _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been in error.\\nYour superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.\\nIf it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.\\nBut I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister\\'s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.\\nThat I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.\\nI did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\\nMy objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.\\nBut there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.\\nThese causes must be stated, though briefly.\\nThe situation of your mother\\'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.\\nPardon me.\\nIt pains me to offend you.\\nBut amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.\\nI will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.\\nHe left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\\n\"The part which I acted is now to be explained.\\nHis sisters\\' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.\\nWe accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice.\\nI described, and enforced them earnestly.\\nBut, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister\\'s indifference.\\nHe had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.\\nBut Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own.\\nTo convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.\\nTo persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.\\nI cannot blame myself for having done thus much.\\nThere is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister\\'s being in town.\\nI knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.\\nThat they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.\\nPerhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best.\\nOn this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.\\nIf I have wounded your sister\\'s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.\\n\"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.\\nWickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.\\nOf what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\\n\"Mr.\\nWickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.\\nMy father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman\\'s education.\\nMy father was not only fond of this young man\\'s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.\\nAs for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.\\nThe vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.\\nDarcy could not have.\\nHere again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.\\nBut whatever may be the sentiments which Mr.\\nWickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.\\n\"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.\\nWickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant.\\nThere was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.\\nHis own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\nWickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.\\nHe had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.\\nI rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.\\nI knew that Mr.\\nWickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.\\nAll connection between us seemed now dissolved.\\nI thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.\\nIn town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\\nFor about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.\\nHis circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.\\nHe had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father\\'s intentions.\\nYou will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it.\\nHis resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.\\nAfter this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.\\nHow he lived I know not.\\nBut last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\n\"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.\\nHaving said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.\\nMy sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother\\'s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.\\nAbout a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\\nWickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.\\nYounge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.\\nShe was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.\\nI joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.\\nYou may imagine what I felt and how I acted.\\nRegard for my sister\\'s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr.\\nWickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.\\nYounge was of course removed from her charge.\\nMr.\\nWickham\\'s chief object was unquestionably my sister\\'s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.\\nHis revenge would have been complete indeed.\\n\"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.\\nWickham.\\nI know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.\\nIgnorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.\\n\"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.\\nFor the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father\\'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.\\nIf your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.\\nI will only add, God bless you.\\n\"FITZWILLIAM DARC.\"\\nDarcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.\\nBut such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\\nHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.\\nWith amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.\\nWith a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.\\nShe read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.\\nHis belief of her sister\\'s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.\\nHe expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.\\nIt was all pride and insolence.\\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\nWickham--when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.\\nShe wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, \"This must be false!\\nThis cannot be!\\nThis must be the grossest falsehood!\"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.\\nIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr.\\nDarcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.\\nSo far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great.\\nWhat Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.\\nBut when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham\\'s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.\\nShe put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.\\nOn both sides it was only assertion.\\nAgain she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr.\\nWickham\\'s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.\\nShe had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.\\nOf his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.\\nAs to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring.\\nHis countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\\nShe tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.\\nDarcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr.\\nDarcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years\\' continuance.\\nBut no such recollection befriended her.\\nShe could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.\\nAfter pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.\\nBut, alas!\\nthe story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin\\'s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.\\nAt one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr.\\nDarcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin\\'s corroboration.\\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr.\\nPhillips\\'s.\\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.\\nShe was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.\\nShe saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.\\nShe remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr.\\nDarcy--that Mr.\\nDarcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.\\nShe remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.\\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!\\nHis attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown.\\nEvery lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\nDarcy, she could not but allow that Mr.\\nBingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr.\\nWickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr.\\nBingley, was incomprehensible.\\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.\\nOf neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.\\n\"How despicably I have acted.\"\\nshe cried; \"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!\\nI, who have valued myself on my abilities!\\nwho have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\nHow humiliating is this discovery!\\nYet, how just a humiliation!\\nHad I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\nBut vanity, not love, has been my folly.\\nPleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.\\nTill this moment I never knew myself.\"\\nFrom herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again.\\nWidely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\nHow could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?\\nHe declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister\\'s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte\\'s opinion had always been.\\nNeither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.\\nShe felt that Jane\\'s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.\\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.\\nThe justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.\\nIt soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane\\'s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\nAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\\nShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr.\\nDarcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\nElizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.\\nColonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think only of her letter.\\nCollins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.\\nTo Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.\\nElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship\\'s indignation would have been.\\n\"What would she have said?\\nhow would she have behaved?\"\\nwere questions with which she amused herself.\\nTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.\\n\"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly.\"\\nsaid Lady Catherine; \"I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do.\\nBut I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me!\\nThey were excessively sorry to go!\\nBut so they always are.\\nThe dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year.\\nHis attachment to Rosings certainly increases.\"\\nMr.\\nCollins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:  \"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer.\\nMrs.\\nCollins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.\"\\n\"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"but it is not in my power to accept it.\\nI must be in town next Saturday.\"\\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.\\nI expected you to stay two months.\\nI told Mrs.\\nCollins so before you came.\\nThere can be no occasion for your going so soon.\\nMrs.\\nBennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.\"\\n\"But my father cannot.\\nHe wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nyour father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father.\\nAnd if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.\"\\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.\"\\nLady Catherine seemed resigned.\\n\"Mrs.\\nCollins, you must send a servant with them.\\nYou know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.\\nIt is highly improper.\\nYou must contrive to send somebody.\\nI have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.\\nYoung women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.\\nWhen my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her.\\nMiss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.\\nDarcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.\\nI am excessively attentive to all those things.\\nYou must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.\\nCollins.\\nI am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\"\\n\"My uncle is to send a servant for us.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nYour uncle!\\nHe keeps a man-servant, does he?\\nI am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things.\\nWhere shall you change horses?\\nOh!\\nBromley, of course.\\nIf you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\"\\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\nReflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\\nMr.\\nDarcy\\'s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.\\nShe studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.\\nWhen she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.\\nIn her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\\nThey were hopeless of remedy.\\nHer father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.\\nElizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother\\'s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?\\nCatherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia\\'s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.\\nThey were ignorant, idle, and vain.\\nWhile there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.\\nAnxiety on Jane\\'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.\\nHis affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.\\nHow grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham\\'s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\\nTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first.\\nThe very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\\nWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\nCollins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\\n\"I know not, Miss Elizabeth.\"\\nsaid he, \"whether Mrs.\\nCollins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.\\nThe favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.\\nWe know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode.\\nOur plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.\"\\nElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.\\nShe had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.\\nMr.\\nCollins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:  \"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.\\nWe have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.\\nOur situation with regard to Lady Catherine\\'s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.\\nYou see on what a footing we are.\\nYou see how continually we are engaged there.\\nIn truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.\"\\nWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\n\"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.\\nI flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.\\nLady Catherine\\'s great attentions to Mrs.\\nCollins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.\\nOnly let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.\\nMy dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.\\nThere is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.\\nWe seem to have been designed for each other.\"\\nElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.\\nShe was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.\\nPoor Charlotte!\\nit was melancholy to leave her to such society!\\nBut she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.\\nHer home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\nAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.\\nAfter an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr.\\nCollins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner, though unknown.\\nHe then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.\\n\"But.\"\\nhe added, \"you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.\"\\nElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.\\n\"Good gracious.\"\\ncried Maria, after a few minutes\\' silence, \"it seems but a day or two since we first came!\\nand yet how many things have happened.\"\\n\"A great many indeed.\"\\nsaid her companion with a sigh.\\n\"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\\nHow much I shall have to tell.\"\\nElizabeth added privately, \"And how much I shall have to conceal.\"\\nTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr.\\nGardiner\\'s house, where they were to remain a few days.\\nJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.\\nBut Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\\nIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s proposals.\\nTo know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.\\nBennet\\'s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman\\'s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.\\nThese two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.\\nAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, \"Is not this nice?\\nIs not this an agreeable surprise?\"\\n\"And we mean to treat you all.\"\\nadded Lydia, \"but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.\"\\nThen, showing her purchases--\"Look here, I have bought this bonnet.\\nI do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.\\nI shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.\"\\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, \"Oh!\\nbut there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.\\nBesides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\"\\n\"Are they indeed.\"\\ncried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!\\nIt would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all.\\nMamma would like to go too of all things!\\nOnly think what a miserable summer else we shall have.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nthought Elizabeth, \"_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once.\\nGood Heaven!\\nBrighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton.\"\\n\"Now I have got some news for you.\"\\nsaid Lydia, as they sat down at table.\\n\"What do you think?\\nIt is excellent news--capital news--and about a certain person we all like.\"\\nJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay.\\nLydia laughed, and said:  \"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.\\nYou thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!\\nI dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.\\nBut he is an ugly fellow!\\nI am glad he is gone.\\nI never saw such a long chin in my life.\\nWell, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?\\nThere is no danger of Wickham\\'s marrying Mary King.\\nThere\\'s for you!\\nShe is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.\\nWickham is safe.\"\\n\"And Mary King is safe.\"\\nadded Elizabeth; \"safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.\"\\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side.\"\\nsaid Jane.\\n\"I am sure there is not on _his_.\\nI will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?\"\\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!\\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty\\'s and Lydia\\'s purchases, were seated in it.\\n\"How nicely we are all crammed in.\"\\ncried Lydia.\\n\"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!\\nWell, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.\\nAnd in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away.\\nHave you seen any pleasant men?\\nHave you had any flirting?\\nI was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.\\nJane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\\nShe is almost three-and-twenty!\\nLord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!\\nMy aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can\\'t think.\\nShe says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\\nCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.\\nLord!\\nhow I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\nDear me!\\nwe had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster\\'s.\\nKitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.\\nForster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.\\nForster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?\\nWe dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\\'s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!\\nNot a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!\\nWhen Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.\\nLord!\\nhow I laughed!\\nand so did Mrs.\\nForster.\\nI thought I should have died.\\nAnd _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\"\\nWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty\\'s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.\\nElizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\\'s name.\\nTheir reception at home was most kind.\\nMrs.\\nBennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr.\\nBennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:  \"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.\\nBennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\\'s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\\n\"Oh!\\nMary.\"\\nsaid she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\\nAs we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.\\nAnd then when we came away it was such fun!\\nI thought we never should have got into the coach.\\nI was ready to die of laughter.\\nAnd then we were so merry all the way home!\\nwe talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off.\"\\nTo this Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures!\\nThey would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.\\nBut I confess they would have no charms for _me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word.\\nShe seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.\\nIt should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.\\nThere was another reason too for her opposition.\\nShe dreaded seeing Mr.\\nWickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.\\nThe comfort to _her_ of the regiment\\'s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.\\nIn a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\nShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.\\nElizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\nDarcy and herself.\\nMiss Bennet\\'s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.\\nShe was sorry that Mr.\\nDarcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\\'s refusal must have given him.\\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong.\"\\nsaid she, \"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment.\"\\n\"Indeed.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\\nYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\"\\n\"Blame you!\\nOh, no.\"\\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\\n\"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\"\\n\"But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day.\"\\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.\\nWhat a stroke was this for poor Jane!\\nwho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.\\nNor was Darcy\\'s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\\nMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other.\\n\"This will not do.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to make both of them good for anything.\\nTake your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.\\nThere is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.\\nFor my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\\'s; but you shall do as you choose.\"\\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"Wickham so very bad!\\nIt is almost past belief.\\nAnd poor Mr.\\nDarcy!\\nDear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\\nSuch a disappointment!\\nand with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!\\nand having to relate such a thing of his sister!\\nIt is really too distressing.\\nI am sure you must feel it so.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nno, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.\\nI know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.\\nYour profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\"\\n\"Poor Wickham!\\nthere is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!\\nsuch an openness and gentleness in his manner.\"\\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.\\nOne has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\"\\n\"I never thought Mr.\\nDarcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do.\"\\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.\\nIt is such a spur to one\\'s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\nOne may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.\"\\n\"Indeed, I could not.\\nI was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy.\\nAnd with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!\\nOh!\\nhow I wanted you.\"\\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr.\\nDarcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved.\"\\n\"Certainly.\\nBut the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.\\nThere is one point on which I want your advice.\\nI want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham\\'s character.\"\\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.\\nWhat is your opinion?\"\\n\"That it ought not to be attempted.\\nMr.\\nDarcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.\\nOn the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?\\nThe general prejudice against Mr.\\nDarcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light.\\nI am not equal to it.\\nWickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is.\\nSome time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.\\nAt present I will say nothing about it.\"\\n\"You are quite right.\\nTo have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.\\nHe is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.\\nWe must not make him desperate.\"\\nThe tumult of Elizabeth\\'s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\nShe had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.\\nBut there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure.\\nShe dared not relate the other half of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend.\\nHere was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery.\\n\"And then.\"\\nsaid she, \"if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.\\nThe liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value.\"\\nShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister\\'s spirits.\\nJane was not happy.\\nShe still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.\\nHaving never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.\\n\"Well, Lizzy.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet one day, \"what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane\\'s?\\nFor my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.\\nI told my sister Phillips so the other day.\\nBut I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London.\\nWell, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there\\'s the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.\\nThere is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.\"\\n\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\\n\"Oh well!\\nit is just as he chooses.\\nNobody wants him to come.\\nThough I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.\\nWell, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\"\\nBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.\\n\"Well, Lizzy.\"\\ncontinued her mother, soon afterwards, \"and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?\\nWell, well, I only hope it will last.\\nAnd what sort of table do they keep?\\nCharlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.\\nIf she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.\\nThere is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.\"\\n\"No, nothing at all.\"\\n\"A great deal of good management, depend upon it.\\nYes, yes.\\n_they_ will take care not to outrun their income.\\n_They_ will never be distressed for money.\\nWell, much good may it do them!\\nAnd so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.\\nThey look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.\"\\n\"It was a subject which they could not mention before me.\"\\n\"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves.\\nWell, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.\\nI should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.\"\\nThe second began.\\nIt was the last of the regiment\\'s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.\\nThe dejection was almost universal.\\nThe elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.\\nVery frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.\\n\"Good Heaven!\\nwhat is to become of us?\\nWhat are we to do?\"\\nwould they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.\\n\"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?\"\\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.\\n\"I am sure.\"\\nsaid she, \"I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller\\'s regiment went away.\\nI thought I should have broken my heart.\"\\n\"I am sure I shall break _mine_.\"\\nsaid Lydia.\\n\"If one could but go to Brighton.\"\\nobserved Mrs.\\nBennet.\\n\"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!\\nBut papa is so disagreeable.\"\\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\"\\n\"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good.\"\\nadded Kitty.\\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House.\\nElizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.\\nShe felt anew the justice of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.\\nBut the gloom of Lydia\\'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs.\\nForster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.\\nThis invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.\\nA resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months\\' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\nForster, the delight of Mrs.\\nBennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.\\nWholly inattentive to her sister\\'s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\\'s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\n\"I cannot see why Mrs.\\nForster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia.\"\\nsaid she, \"Though I am _not_ her particular friend.\\nI have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\"\\nIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.\\nAs for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.\\nShe represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\\'s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.\\nForster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.\\nHe heard her attentively, and then said:  \"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.\"\\n\"If you were aware.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\\'s unguarded and imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.\"\\n\"Already arisen?\"\\nrepeated Mr.\\nBennet.\\n\"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?\\nPoor little Lizzy!\\nBut do not be cast down.\\nSuch squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.\\nCome, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia\\'s folly.\"\\n\"Indeed you are mistaken.\\nI have no such injuries to resent.\\nIt is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.\\nOur importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia\\'s character.\\nExcuse me, for I must speak plainly.\\nIf you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.\\nHer character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.\\nIn this danger Kitty also is comprehended.\\nShe will follow wherever Lydia leads.\\nVain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!\\nOh!\\nmy dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?\"\\nMr.\\nBennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply:  \"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.\\nWherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly sisters.\\nWe shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.\\nLet her go, then.\\nColonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody.\\nAt Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\\nThe officers will find women better worth their notice.\\nLet us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.\\nAt any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.\"\\nWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.\\nIt was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.\\nShe was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\nHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.\\nIn Lydia\\'s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.\\nShe saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\\nShe saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.\\nShe saw all the glories of the camp--its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\\nHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?\\nThey could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.\\nLydia\\'s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband\\'s never intending to go there himself.\\nBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia\\'s leaving home.\\nElizabeth was now to see Mr.\\nWickham for the last time.\\nHaving been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so.\\nShe had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.\\nIn his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.\\nShe lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\\nOn the very last day of the regiment\\'s remaining at Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam\\'s and Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment\\'s recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.\\nHer answer was warmly in his favour.\\nWith an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:  \"How long did you say he was at Rosings?\"\\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin\\'s.\"\\n\"Yes, very different.\\nBut I think Mr.\\nDarcy improves upon acquaintance.\"\\n\"Indeed.\"\\ncried Mr.\\nWickham with a look which did not escape her.\\n\"And pray, may I ask?-.\"\\nBut checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, \"Is it in address that he improves?\\nHas he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope.\"\\nhe continued in a lower and more serious tone, \"that he is improved in essentials.\"\\n\"Oh, no.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth.\\n\"In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.\"\\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.\\nThere was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:  \"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\"\\nWickham\\'s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:  \"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr.\\nDarcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.\\nHis pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.\\nI only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe.\\nHis fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\"\\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.\\nShe saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.\\nThe rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.\\nWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.\\nForster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.\\nThe separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.\\nKitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.\\nMrs.\\nBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\nHer father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.\\nRespect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.\\nBut Mr.\\nBennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.\\nHe was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.\\nTo his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.\\nThis is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\\nElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father\\'s behaviour as a husband.\\nShe had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.\\nBut she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\\nWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham\\'s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.\\nTheir parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp.\\nUpon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.\\nIt was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.\\nHer tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\n\"But it is fortunate.\"\\nthought she, \"that I have something to wish for.\\nWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\\nBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister\\'s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised.\\nA scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.\"\\nWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.\\nThose to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.\\nForster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.\\nAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\nEverything wore a happier aspect.\\nThe families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.\\nMrs.\\nBennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.\\nThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.\\nGardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.\\nMr.\\nGardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire.\\nIn that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.\\nGardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.\\nThe town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.\\nElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough.\\nBut it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\nWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.\\nIt was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.\\n\"But surely.\"\\nsaid she, \"I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\"\\nThe period of expectation was now doubled.\\nFour weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt\\'s arrival.\\nBut they did pass away, and Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.\\nThe children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\\nThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\\nOne enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\nIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc.\\nare sufficiently known.\\nA small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.\\nTo the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.\\nGardiner\\'s former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.\\nIt was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.\\nIn talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.\\nGardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.\\nMr.\\nGardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\n\"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?\"\\nsaid her aunt; \"a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected.\\nWickham passed all his youth there, you know.\"\\nElizabeth was distressed.\\nShe felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.\\nShe must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner abused her stupidity.\\n\"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished.\"\\nsaid she, \"I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.\\nThey have some of the finest woods in the country.\"\\nElizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.\\nThe possibility of meeting Mr.\\nDarcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.\\nIt would be dreadful!\\nShe blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk.\\nBut against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.\\nAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\\nwhat was the name of its proprietor?\\nand, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer?\\nA most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.\\nTo Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\nThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\nThey entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.\\nThey gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.\\nIt was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.\\nIts banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.\\nElizabeth was delighted.\\nShe had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.\\nThey were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\nThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned.\\nShe dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.\\nOn applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.\\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.\\nThey followed her into the dining-parlour.\\nIt was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.\\nElizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.\\nThe hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.\\nEvery disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.\\nAs they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.\\nThe rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\n\"And of this place.\"\\nthought she, \"I might have been mistress!\\nWith these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\nInstead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.\\nBut no,\"--recollecting herself--\"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like regret.\\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had not the courage for it.\\nAt length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\\nReynolds replied that he was, adding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.\"\\nHow rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture.\\nShe approached and saw the likeness of Mr.\\nWickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece.\\nHer aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\\nThe housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master\\'s steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense.\\n\"He is now gone into the army.\"\\nshe added; \"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\\nMrs.\\nGardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.\\n\"And that.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nReynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, \"is my master--and very like him.\\nIt was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago.\"\\n\"I have heard much of your master\\'s fine person.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nGardiner, looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face.\\nBut, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\"\\nMrs.\\nReynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.\\n\"Does that young lady know Mr.\\nDarcy?\"\\nElizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\\'am?\"\\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\\n\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\nThis room was my late master\\'s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.\\nHe was very fond of them.\"\\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr.\\nWickham\\'s being among them.\\nMrs.\\nReynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.\\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nGardiner.\\n\"Oh!\\nyes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.\\nIn the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\"\\nMr.\\nGardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.\\nReynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\\n\"Except.\"\\nthought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.\\nI do not know who is good enough for him.\"\\nMr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner smiled.\\nElizabeth could not help saying, \"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\\n\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him.\"\\nreplied the other.\\nElizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \"I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.\"\\nThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.\\nThat he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\\nHer keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:  \"There are very few people of whom so much can be said.\\nYou are lucky in having such a master.\"\\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am.\\nIf I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.\\nBut I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.\"\\nElizabeth almost stared at her.\\n\"Can this be Mr.\\nDarcy?\"\\nthought she.\\n\"His father was an excellent man.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nGardiner.\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor.\"\\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.\\nMrs.\\nReynolds could interest her on no other point.\\nShe related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.\\nMr.\\nGardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master.\"\\nsaid she, \"that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves.\\nThere is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name.\\nSome people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.\\nTo my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.\"\\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him.\"\\nthought Elizabeth.\\n\"This fine account of him.\"\\nwhispered her aunt as they walked, \"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\n\"He is certainly a good brother.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.\\nMrs.\\nReynolds anticipated Miss Darcy\\'s delight, when she should enter the room.\\n\"And this is always the way with him.\"\\nshe added.\\n\"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment.\\nThere is nothing he would not do for her.\"\\nThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown.\\nIn the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy\\'s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.\\nElizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\nAt last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr.\\nDarcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her.\\nShe stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\\nMrs.\\nReynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father\\'s lifetime.\\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth\\'s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance.\\nThe commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.\\nReynolds was of no trifling nature.\\nWhat praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?\\nAs a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people\\'s happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him!\\nEvery idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.\\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.\\nAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\\nThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.\\nTheir eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush.\\nHe absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.\\nHad his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr.\\nDarcy, the gardener\\'s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.\\nThey stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.\\nAmazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life.\\nNor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\nAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.\\nThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.\\nShe was overpowered by shame and vexation.\\nHer coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!\\nHow strange it must appear to him!\\nIn what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!\\nIt might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!\\nOh!\\nwhy did she come?\\nOr, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?\\nHad they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.\\nShe blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.\\nAnd his behaviour, so strikingly altered--what could it mean?\\nThat he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\\nNever in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\\nWhat a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!\\nShe knew not what to think, or how to account for it.\\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.\\nHer thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr.\\nDarcy then was.\\nShe longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him.\\nPerhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was not like ease.\\nWhether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\\nThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.\\nMr.\\nGardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\\nWith a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\\nIt settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\\nThey crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\\nElizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.\\nGardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.\\nHer niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr.\\nGardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.\\nWhilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth\\'s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.\\nDarcy approaching them, and at no great distance.\\nThe walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.\\nElizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.\\nFor a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.\\nThe idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.\\nWith a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words \"delightful.\"\\nand \"charming.\"\\nwhen some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed.\\nHer colour changed, and she said no more.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\\nThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.\\n\"What will be his surprise.\"\\nthought she, \"when he knows who they are?\\nHe takes them now for people of fashion.\"\\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.\\nThat he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr.\\nGardiner.\\nElizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.\\nIt was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.\\nShe listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\nDarcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\\nElizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.\\nHer astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered?\\nFrom what can it proceed?\\nIt cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.\\nMy reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.\\nIt is impossible that he should still love me.\"\\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.\\nIt originated in Mrs.\\nGardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth\\'s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband\\'s.\\nMr.\\nDarcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.\\nAfter a short silence, the lady first spoke.\\nShe wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--\"for your housekeeper.\"\\nshe added, \"informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.\"\\nHe acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.\\n\"They will join me early to-morrow.\"\\nhe continued, \"and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr.\\nBingley and his sisters.\"\\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow.\\nHer thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr.\\nBingley\\'s name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.\\n\"There is also one other person in the party.\"\\nhe continued after a pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you.\\nWill you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?\"\\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.\\nShe immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\\nThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\nElizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.\\nHis wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind.\\nThey soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\nHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.\\nAt such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.\\nShe wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject.\\nAt last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.\\nYet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over.\\nOn Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner\\'s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness.\\nMr.\\nDarcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\\nThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\\n\"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming.\"\\nsaid her uncle.\\n\"There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure.\"\\nreplied her aunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.\\nI can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.\"\\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.\\nIt was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.\\nHis acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\\n\"To be sure, Lizzy.\"\\nsaid her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham\\'s countenance, for his features are perfectly good.\\nBut how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?\"\\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities.\"\\nreplied her uncle.\\n\"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.\"\\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing.\\n\"From what we have seen of him.\"\\ncontinued Mrs.\\nGardiner, \"I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.\\nHe has not an ill-natured look.\\nOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.\\nAnd there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.\\nBut, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.\\nBut he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.\"\\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\\'s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.\\nIn confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else.\\nFatigued as she had been by the morning\\'s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years\\' discontinuance.\\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\\nDarcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.\\nThey had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street.\\nElizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.\\nHer uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.\\nNothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.\\nWhile these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth\\'s feelings was at every moment increasing.\\nShe was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.\\nWith astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.\\nSince her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.\\nShe found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.\\nShe was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.\\nElizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.\\nDarcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.\\nThey had not long been together before Mr.\\nDarcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley\\'s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.\\nAll Elizabeth\\'s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again.\\nHe inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\nTo Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.\\nThey had long wished to see him.\\nThe whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.\\nThe suspicions which had just arisen of Mr.\\nDarcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.\\nOf the lady\\'s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do.\\nShe wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.\\nBingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\\nhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner.\\nSometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.\\nBut, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane.\\nNo look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.\\nNothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.\\nOn this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.\\nHe observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her.\"\\nand, before she could reply, he added, \"It is above eight months.\\nWe have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.\\nThere was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.\\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr.\\nDarcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.\\nWhen she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.\\nNever, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.\\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr.\\nDarcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.\\nMiss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.\\nPresuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.\\nElizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.\\nEager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner\\'s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.\\nIt was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr.\\nDarcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.\\nThey saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\\nOf Mr.\\nDarcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\nThey could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant\\'s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nThere was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.\\nNeither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.\\nThey had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit.\\nIt was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr.\\nDarcy afterwards discharged.\\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out.\\nShe certainly did not hate him.\\nNo; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.\\nThe respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.\\nBut above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\\nIt was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.\\nHe who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.\\nSuch a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.\\nShe respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.\\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy\\'s in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.\\nThey were, therefore, to go.\\nElizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\nMr.\\nGardiner left them soon after breakfast.\\nThe fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.\\nIts windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs.\\nHurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.\\nGeorgiana\\'s reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\\nBy Mrs.\\nHurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.\\nIt was first broken by Mrs.\\nAnnesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs.\\nGardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.\\nMiss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.\\nThis observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.\\nHer own thoughts were employing her.\\nShe expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.\\nShe wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.\\nAfter sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley\\'s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family.\\nShe answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.\\nAnnesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.\\nThere was now employment for the whole party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.\\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\nDarcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\nHe had been some time with Mr.\\nGardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.\\nNo sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.\\nIn no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\\'s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr.\\nDarcy were by no means over.\\nMiss Darcy, on her brother\\'s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.\\nMiss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:  \"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\"\\nIn Darcy\\'s presence she dared not mention Wickham\\'s name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment\\'s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone.\\nWhile she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.\\nHad Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy\\'s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.\\nNot a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\\'s meditated elopement.\\nTo no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\\'s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.\\nHe had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.\\nElizabeth\\'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.\\nHer brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr.\\nDarcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\\'s person, behaviour, and dress.\\nBut Georgiana would not join her.\\nHer brother\\'s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err.\\nAnd he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.\\nWhen Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\n\"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\nshe cried; \"I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\\nShe is grown so brown and coarse!\\nLouisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\"\\nHowever little Mr.\\nDarcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.\\n\"For my own part.\"\\nshe rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.\\nHer face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.\\nHer nose wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines.\\nHer teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.\\nThey have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.\"\\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.\\nHe was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued:  \"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, \\'_She_ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.\\' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nreplied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but _that_ was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.\\nThe look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.\\nThey talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.\\nGardiner thought of him, and Mrs.\\nGardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece\\'s beginning the subject.\\nElizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.\\nThe one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago.\\nThe beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.\\nIt was to this effect:  \"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well.\\nWhat I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!\\nImagine our surprise.\\nTo Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.\\nI am very, very sorry.\\nSo imprudent a match on both sides!\\nBut I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.\\nHis choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved.\\nMy father bears it better.\\nHow thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.\\nThey were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.\\nThe express was sent off directly.\\nMy dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.\\nColonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.\\nLydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.\\nI must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.\\nI am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.\"\\nWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\\n\"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent.\\nDearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\nImprudent as the marriage between Mr.\\nWickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.\\nColonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.\\nThough Lydia\\'s short letter to Mrs.\\nF.\\ngave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.\\nintending to trace their route.\\nHe did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.\\nI know not what to think.\\nAfter making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F.\\ncame on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through.\\nWith the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\\nI am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs.\\nF., but no one can throw any blame on them.\\nOur distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.\\nMy father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.\\nMany circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia\\'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\\nImpossible!\\nI grieve to find, however, that Colonel F.\\nis not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.\\nwas not a man to be trusted.\\nMy poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room.\\nCould she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected.\\nAnd as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.\\nPoor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder.\\nI am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?\\nI am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.\\nAdieu!\\nI take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible.\\nI know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.\\nMy father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.\\nWhat he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.\\nIn such an exigence, my uncle\\'s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nwhere, where is my uncle?\"\\ncried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr.\\nDarcy appeared.\\nHer pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia\\'s situation, hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\\nI must find Mr.\\nGardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.\"\\n\"Good God!\\nwhat is the matter?\"\\ncried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner.\\nYou are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\nCalling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\nOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, \"Let me call your maid.\\nIs there nothing you could take to give you present relief?\\nA glass of wine; shall I get you one?\\nYou are very ill.\"\\n\"No, I thank you.\"\\nshe replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\n\"There is nothing the matter with me.\\nI am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.\\nDarcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.\\nAt length she spoke again.\\n\"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.\\nIt cannot be concealed from anyone.\\nMy younger sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.\\nWickham.\\nThey are gone off together from Brighton.\\n_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.\\nShe has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\"\\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.\\n\"When I consider.\"\\nshe added in a yet more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it!\\nI, who knew what he was.\\nHad I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family!\\nHad his character been known, this could not have happened.\\nBut it is all--all too late now.\"\\n\"I am grieved indeed.\"\\ncried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked.\\nBut is it certain--absolutely certain?\"\\n\"Oh, yes!\\nThey left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.\"\\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle\\'s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour.\\nBut nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done.\\nHow is such a man to be worked on?\\nHow are they even to be discovered?\\nI have not the smallest hope.\\nIt is every way horrible.\"\\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\n\"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh!\\nhad I known what I ought, what I dared to do!\\nBut I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much.\\nWretched, wretched mistake.\"\\nDarcy made no answer.\\nHe seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy.\\nElizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.\\nHer power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.\\nShe could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.\\nIt was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.\\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.\\nLydia--the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.\\nWould to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress!\\nBut I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\\nThis unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister\\'s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\\n\"Oh, yes.\\nBe so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.\\nSay that urgent business calls us home immediately.\\nConceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.\\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth\\'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.\\nBut if otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.\\nBe that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\\'s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.\\nNever, since reading Jane\\'s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\\'s meaning to marry her.\\nNo one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.\\nSurprise was the least of her feelings on this development.\\nWhile the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible.\\nBut now it was all too natural.\\nFor such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.\\nSometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.\\nHer affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object.\\nThe mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh!\\nhow acutely did she now feel it!\\nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle\\'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe.\\nMr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant\\'s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner could not but be deeply afflicted.\\nNot Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr.\\nGardiner promised every assistance in his power.\\nElizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled.\\nThey were to be off as soon as possible.\\n\"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\"\\ncried Mrs.\\nGardiner.\\n\"John told us Mr.\\nDarcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?\"\\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\\n_That_ is all settled.\"\\n\"What is all settled?\"\\nrepeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.\\n\"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?\\nOh, that I knew how it was.\"\\nBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.\\nHad Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.\\nAn hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\\nGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\\nsaid her uncle, as they drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter.\\nIt appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel\\'s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.\\nCould he expect that her friends would not step forward?\\nCould he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?\\nHis temptation is not adequate to the risk.\"\\n\"Do you really think so?\"\\ncried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\\n\"Upon my word.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nGardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle\\'s opinion.\\nIt is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of.\\nI cannot think so very ill of Wickham.\\nCan you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?\"\\n\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable.\\nIf, indeed, it should be so!\\nBut I dare not hope it.\\nWhy should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?\"\\n\"In the first place.\"\\nreplied Mr.\\nGardiner, \"there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nbut their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption!\\nAnd, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.\"\\n\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London.\\nThey may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose.\\nIt is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\"\\n\"But why all this secrecy?\\nWhy any fear of detection?\\nWhy must their marriage be private?\\nOh, no, no--this is not likely.\\nHis most particular friend, you see by Jane\\'s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.\\nWickham will never marry a woman without some money.\\nHe cannot afford it.\\nAnd what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?\\nAs to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.\\nBut as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.\\nLydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\\'s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.\"\\n\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\"\\n\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \"that a sister\\'s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.\\nBut, really, I know not what to say.\\nPerhaps I am not doing her justice.\\nBut she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.\\nShe has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\\nSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head.\\nShe has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it?\\nsusceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.\\nAnd we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.\"\\n\"But you see that Jane.\"\\nsaid her aunt, \"does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\\n\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill?\\nAnd who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?\\nBut Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.\\nWe both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\"\\n\"And do you really know all this?\"\\ncried Mrs.\\nGardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\n\"I do indeed.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, colouring.\\n\"I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr.\\nDarcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.\\nAnd there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.\\nFrom what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.\\nYet he knew to the contrary himself.\\nHe must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.\"\\n\"But does Lydia know nothing of this?\\ncan she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\\n\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.\\nTill I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr.\\nDarcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.\\nAnd when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight\\'s time.\\nAs that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown?\\nAnd even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.\\nForster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.\\nThat _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.\\nThat such a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.\"\\n\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\\n\"Not the slightest.\\nI can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away.\\nWhen first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.\\nEvery girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\"\\n* * * * *  It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.\\nFrom Elizabeth\\'s thoughts it was never absent.\\nFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\\nThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.\\nIt was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.\\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother\\'s apartment, immediately met her.\\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.\\n\"Not yet.\"\\nreplied Jane.\\n\"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well.\"\\n\"Is my father in town?\"\\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.\"\\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\\n\"We have heard only twice.\\nHe wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.\\nHe merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention.\"\\n\"And my mother--how is she?\\nHow are you all?\"\\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.\\nShe is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.\\nShe does not yet leave her dressing-room.\\nMary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.\"\\n\"But you--how are you?\"\\ncried Elizabeth.\\n\"You look pale.\\nHow much you must have gone through.\"\\nHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party.\\nJane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.\\nThe sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\\nMrs.\\nBennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes\\' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.\\n\"If I had been able.\"\\nsaid she, \"to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.\\nWhy did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?\\nI am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after.\\nI always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am.\\nPoor dear child!\\nAnd now here\\'s Mr.\\nBennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?\\nThe Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.\"\\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr.\\nGardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\\nBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm.\"\\nadded he; \"though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\\nIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\\nIn a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.\\nAs soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nmy dear brother.\"\\nreplied Mrs.\\nBennet, \"that is exactly what I could most wish for.\\nAnd now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.\\nAnd as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married.\\nAnd, above all, keep Mr.\\nBennet from fighting.\\nTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.\\nAnd tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.\\nOh, brother, how kind you are!\\nI know you will contrive it all.\"\\nBut Mr.\\nGardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\\nThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\\nIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before.\\nOne came from her books, and the other from her toilette.\\nThe faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty.\\nAs for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:  \"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\\nBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.\"\\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, \"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\"\\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.\\nMary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.\\nAfter joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard.\\nGive me further particulars.\\nWhat did Colonel Forster say?\\nHad they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place?\\nThey must have seen them together for ever.\"\\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia\\'s side, but nothing to give him any alarm.\\nI am so grieved for him!\\nHis behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.\\nHe _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?\\nDid he know of their intending to go off?\\nHad Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\\n\"Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it.\\nHe did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\"\\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?\\nI felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister\\'s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.\\nMy father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.\\nKitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia\\'s last letter she had prepared her for such a step.\\nShe had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.\"\\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\\n\"No, I believe not.\"\\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?\\nDoes he know his real character?\"\\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.\\nHe believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\nAnd since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.\"\\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened.\"\\n\"Perhaps it would have been better.\"\\nreplied her sister.\\n\"But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.\\nWe acted with the best intentions.\"\\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia\\'s note to his wife?\"\\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\nThese were the contents:  \"MY DEAR HARRIET,  \"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.\\nI am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.\\nI should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.\\nYou need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name \\'Lydia Wickham.\\' What a good joke it will be!\\nI can hardly write for laughing.\\nPray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.\\nTell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.\\nI shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.\\nGood-bye.\\nGive my love to Colonel Forster.\\nI hope you will drink to our good journey.\\n\"Your affectionate friend,  \"LYDIA BENNET.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nthoughtless, thoughtless Lydia.\"\\ncried Elizabeth when she had finished it.\\n\"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!\\nBut at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their journey.\\nWhatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy.\\nMy poor father!\\nhow he must have felt it.\"\\n\"I never saw anyone so shocked.\\nHe could not speak a word for full ten minutes.\\nMy mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nJane.\"\\ncried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\\n\"I do not know.\\nI hope there was.\\nBut to be guarded at such a time is very difficult.\\nMy mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done!\\nBut the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.\"\\n\"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.\\nYou do not look well.\\nOh that I had been with you!\\nyou have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.\"\\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.\\nKitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.\\nMy aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.\\nShe was of great use and comfort to us all.\\nAnd Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters\\', if they should be of use to us.\"\\n\"She had better have stayed at home.\"\\ncried Elizabeth; \"perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one\\'s neighbours.\\nAssistance is impossible; condolence insufferable.\\nLet them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\"\\nShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\\n\"He meant I believe.\"\\nreplied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them.\\nHis principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.\\nIt had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady\\'s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.\\nIf he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.\\nI do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.\"\\nBennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\\nHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\\nThey were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.\\nMr.\\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\\nWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr.\\nBennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband\\'s not being killed in a duel.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.\\nShe shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\nBennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom.\\nTheir other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham\\'s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.\\nAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.\\nHe was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman\\'s family.\\nEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.\\nElizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister\\'s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.\\nMr.\\nGardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr.\\nBennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr.\\nBennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.\\nMr.\\nGardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.\\nHe added that Mr.\\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon.\\nThere was also a postscript to this effect:  \"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man\\'s intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself.\\nIf there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.\\nAt present we have nothing to guide us.\\nColonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head.\\nBut, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person.\"\\nElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.\\nShe had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.\\nIt was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.\\nEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.\\nThe arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning\\'s impatience.\\nThrough letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\\nBut before they heard again from Mr.\\nGardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr.\\nCollins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.\\nIt was as follows:  \"MY DEAR SIR,  \"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.\\nBe assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.\\nCollins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.\\nNo arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent\\'s mind.\\nThe death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.\\nAnd it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs.\\nBennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.\\nHowsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs.\\nCollins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.\\nThey agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?\\nAnd this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.\\nLet me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.\\n\"I am, dear sir, etc., etc.\"\\nMr.\\nGardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\\nIt was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.\\nHis former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.\\nThere was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.\\nAnd in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia\\'s relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\\nHe owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.\\nMr.\\nGardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family.\\nJane heard them with horror.\\n\"A gamester.\"\\nshe cried.\\n\"This is wholly unexpected.\\nI had not an idea of it.\"\\nMr.\\nGardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\nRendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\\'s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.\\nWhen Mrs.\\nBennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.\\n\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\"\\nshe cried.\\n\"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.\\nWho is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\"\\nAs Mrs.\\nGardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr.\\nBennet came from it.\\nThe coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\\nMrs.\\nGardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world.\\nHis name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.\\nGardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\\nElizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.\\nThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia\\'s infamy somewhat better.\\nIt would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.\\nWhen Mr.\\nBennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.\\nHe said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.\\nIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, \"Say nothing of that.\\nWho should suffer but myself?\\nIt has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.\"\\n\"You must not be too severe upon yourself.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth.\\n\"You may well warn me against such an evil.\\nHuman nature is so prone to fall into it!\\nNo, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.\\nI am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\\nIt will pass away soon enough.\"\\n\"Do you suppose them to be in London?\"\\n\"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?\"\\n\"And Lydia used to want to go to London.\"\\nadded Kitty.\\n\"She is happy then.\"\\nsaid her father drily; \"and her residence there will probably be of some duration.\"\\nThen after a short silence he continued:  \"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.\"\\nThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother\\'s tea.\\n\"This is a parade.\"\\nhe cried, \"which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!\\nAnother day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.\"\\n\"I am not going to run away, papa.\"\\nsaid Kitty fretfully.\\n\"If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\"\\n\"_You_ go to Brighton.\\nI would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds!\\nNo, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.\\nNo officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village.\\nBalls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.\\nAnd you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\"\\nKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\\n\"Well, well.\"\\nsaid he, \"do not make yourself unhappy.\\nIf you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.\"\\nBennet\\'s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \"I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\"\\n\"What do you mean, Hill?\\nWe have heard nothing from town.\"\\n\"Dear madam.\"\\ncried Mrs.\\nHill, in great astonishment, \"don\\'t you know there is an express come for master from Mr.\\nGardiner?\\nHe has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.\"\\nAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\nThey ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said:  \"If you are looking for my master, ma\\'am, he is walking towards the little copse.\"\\nUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\\nJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:  \"Oh, papa, what news--what news?\\nHave you heard from my uncle?\"\\n\"Yes I have had a letter from him by express.\"\\n\"Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?\"\\n\"What is there of good to be expected?\"\\nsaid he, taking the letter from his pocket.\\n\"But perhaps you would like to read it.\"\\nElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.\\nJane now came up.\\n\"Read it aloud.\"\\nsaid their father, \"for I hardly know myself what it is about.\"\\n\"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.\\n\"MY DEAR BROTHER,  \"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.\\nSoon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were.\\nThe particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.\\nI have seen them both-.\"\\n\"Then it is as I always hoped.\"\\ncried Jane; \"they are married.\"\\nElizabeth read on:  \"I have seen them both.\\nThey are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.\\nAll that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.\\nThese are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.\\nI shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.\\nYou will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr.\\nWickham\\'s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.\\nThe world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.\\nIf, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.\\nThere will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.\\nSend back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.\\nWe have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.\\nShe comes to us to-day.\\nI shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on.\\nYours, etc.,  \"EDW.\\nGARDINER.\"\\n\"Is it possible?\"\\ncried Elizabeth, when she had finished.\\n\"Can it be possible that he will marry her?\"\\n\"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him.\"\\nsaid her sister.\\n\"My dear father, I congratulate you.\"\\n\"And have you answered the letter?\"\\ncried Elizabeth.\\n\"No; but it must be done soon.\"\\nMost earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote.\\n\"Oh!\\nmy dear father.\"\\nshe cried, \"come back and write immediately.\\nConsider how important every moment is in such a case.\"\\n\"Let me write for you.\"\\nsaid Jane, \"if you dislike the trouble yourself.\"\\n\"I dislike it very much.\"\\nhe replied; \"but it must be done.\"\\nAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\\n\"And may I ask-.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\"\\n\"Complied with!\\nI am only ashamed of his asking so little.\"\\n\"And they _must_ marry!\\nYet he is _such_ a man.\"\\n\"Yes, yes, they must marry.\\nThere is nothing else to be done.\\nBut there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\"\\n\"Money!\\nMy uncle.\"\\ncried Jane, \"what do you mean, sir?\"\\n\"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\"\\n\"That is very true.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"though it had not occurred to me before.\\nHis debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!\\nOh!\\nit must be my uncle\\'s doings!\\nGenerous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.\\nA small sum could not do all this.\"\\n\"No.\"\\nsaid her father; \"Wickham\\'s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.\\nI should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\"\\n\"Ten thousand pounds!\\nHeaven forbid!\\nHow is half such a sum to be repaid?\"\\nMr.\\nBennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.\\nTheir father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\\n\"And they are really to be married.\"\\ncried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.\\n\"How strange this is!\\nAnd for _this_ we are to be thankful.\\nThat they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice.\\nOh, Lydia.\"\\n\"I comfort myself with thinking.\"\\nreplied Jane, \"that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.\\nThough our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced.\\nHe has children of his own, and may have more.\\nHow could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\"\\n\"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham\\'s debts have been.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr.\\nGardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.\\nThe kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.\\nTheir taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.\\nBy this time she is actually with them!\\nIf such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!\\nWhat a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt.\"\\n\"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side.\"\\nsaid Jane: \"I hope and trust they will yet be happy.\\nHis consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.\\nTheir mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.\"\\n\"Their conduct has been such.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.\\nIt is useless to talk of it.\"\\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.\\nThey went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.\\nHe was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:  \"Just as you please.\"\\n\"May we take my uncle\\'s letter to read to her?\"\\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together.\\nMary and Kitty were both with Mrs.\\nBennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.\\nAfter a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.\\nMrs.\\nBennet could hardly contain herself.\\nAs soon as Jane had read Mr.\\nGardiner\\'s hope of Lydia\\'s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.\\nShe was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.\\nTo know that her daughter would be married was enough.\\nShe was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\n\"My dear, dear Lydia.\"\\nshe cried.\\n\"This is delightful indeed!\\nShe will be married!\\nI shall see her again!\\nShe will be married at sixteen!\\nMy good, kind brother!\\nI knew how it would be.\\nI knew he would manage everything!\\nHow I long to see her!\\nand to see dear Wickham too!\\nBut the clothes, the wedding clothes!\\nI will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.\\nLizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.\\nStay, stay, I will go myself.\\nRing the bell, Kitty, for Hill.\\nI will put on my things in a moment.\\nMy dear, dear Lydia!\\nHow merry we shall be together when we meet.\"\\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\\nGardiner\\'s behaviour laid them all under.\\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion.\"\\nshe added, \"in a great measure to his kindness.\\nWe are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr.\\nWickham with money.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\ncried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?\\nIf he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents.\\nWell!\\nI am so happy!\\nIn a short time I shall have a daughter married.\\nMrs.\\nWickham!\\nHow well it sounds!\\nAnd she was only sixteen last June.\\nMy dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can\\'t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me.\\nWe will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted.\\nOne day\\'s delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual.\\nOther schemes, too, came into her head.\\n\"I will go to Meryton.\"\\nsaid she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.\\nAnd as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.\\nLong.\\nKitty, run down and order the carriage.\\nAn airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.\\nGirls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?\\nOh!\\nHere comes Hill!\\nMy dear Hill, have you heard the good news?\\nMiss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\"\\nMrs.\\nHill began instantly to express her joy.\\nElizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\\nPoor Lydia\\'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.\\nShe felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\nBennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.\\nHe now wished it more than ever.\\nHad he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.\\nThe satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\\nWhen first Mr.\\nBennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.\\nThe son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.\\nFive daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\\nBennet, for many years after Lydia\\'s birth, had been certain that he would.\\nThis event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.\\nMrs.\\nBennet had no turn for economy, and her husband\\'s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.\\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\nBennet and the children.\\nBut in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\nThis was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr.\\nBennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.\\nIn terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.\\nHe had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement.\\nHe would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother\\'s hands, Lydia\\'s expenses had been very little within that sum.\\nThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.\\nWhen the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.\\nHis letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.\\nHe begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.\\nThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.\\nIt was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.\\nTo be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse.\\nBut there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered certain.\\nIt was a fortnight since Mrs.\\nBennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.\\nNo sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.\\nThe marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.\\nShe was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.\\n\"Haye Park might do.\"\\nsaid she, \"if the Gouldings could quit it--or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off!\\nI could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\"\\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained.\\nBut when they had withdrawn, he said to her: \"Mrs.\\nBennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.\\nInto _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance.\\nI will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\"\\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr.\\nBennet was firm.\\nIt soon led to another; and Mrs.\\nBennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.\\nHe protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.\\nMrs.\\nBennet could hardly comprehend it.\\nThat his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible.\\nShe was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\\'s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.\\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr.\\nDarcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.\\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister\\'s frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.\\nHad Lydia\\'s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr.\\nDarcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.\\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.\\nThe wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.\\nShe was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.\\nShe became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.\\nShe wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.\\nShe was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.\\nWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received!\\nHe was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.\\nShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.\\nHis understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.\\nIt was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.\\nBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.\\nAn union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.\\nHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.\\nBut how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\\n* * * * *  Mr.\\nGardiner soon wrote again to his brother.\\nTo Mr.\\nBennet\\'s acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.\\nThe principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr.\\nWickham had resolved on quitting the militia.\\n\"It was greatly my wish that he should do so.\"\\nhe added, \"as soon as his marriage was fixed on.\\nAnd I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece\\'s.\\nIt is Mr.\\nWickham\\'s intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.\\nHe has the promise of an ensigncy in General ----\\'s regiment, now quartered in the North.\\nIt is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.\\nHe promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.\\nI have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.\\nWickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.\\nAnd will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information?\\nHe has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.\\nHaggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.\\nThey will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\\nGardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South.\\nShe is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Yours, etc.,  \"E.\\nGARDINER.\"\\nMr.\\nBennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\\'s removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr.\\nGardiner could do.\\nBut Mrs.\\nBennet was not so well pleased with it.\\nLydia\\'s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.\\n\"She is so fond of Mrs.\\nForster.\"\\nsaid she, \"it will be quite shocking to send her away!\\nAnd there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.\\nThe officers may not be so pleasant in General ----\\'s regiment.\"\\nHis daughter\\'s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.\\nBut Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister\\'s feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.\\nAnd their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North.\\nWhen Mr.\\nBennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.\\nElizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.\\nThe carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time.\\nTheir arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\nThey came.\\nThe family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them.\\nSmiles decked the face of Mrs.\\nBennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\nLydia\\'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.\\nHer mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\\nTheir reception from Mr.\\nBennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.\\nHis countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.\\nThe easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.\\nElizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.\\nLydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.\\nShe turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.\\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.\\nElizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.\\nShe blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.\\nThere was no want of discourse.\\nThe bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.\\nThey seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.\\nNothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.\\n\"Only think of its being three months.\"\\nshe cried, \"since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.\\nGood gracious!\\nwhen I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!\\nthough I thought it would be very good fun if I was.\"\\nHer father lifted up his eyes.\\nJane was distressed.\\nElizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \"Oh!\\nmamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day?\\nI was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.\"\\nElizabeth could bear it no longer.\\nShe got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour.\\nShe then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother\\'s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, \"Ah!\\nJane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.\"\\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\nHer ease and good spirits increased.\\nShe longed to see Mrs.\\nPhillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs.\\nWickha.\"\\nby each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs.\\nHill and the two housemaids.\\n\"Well, mamma.\"\\nsaid she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, \"and what do you think of my husband?\\nIs not he a charming man?\\nI am sure my sisters must all envy me.\\nI only hope they may have half my good luck.\\nThey must all go to Brighton.\\nThat is the place to get husbands.\\nWhat a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should.\\nBut my dear Lydia, I don\\'t at all like your going such a way off.\\nMust it be so?\"\\n\"Oh, lord!\\nyes;--there is nothing in that.\\nI shall like it of all things.\\nYou and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.\\nWe shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\"\\n\"I should like it beyond anything.\"\\nsaid her mother.\\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.\"\\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.\\nMr.\\nWickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\nNo one but Mrs.\\nBennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.\\nThese parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\nWickham\\'s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia\\'s for him.\\nShe had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.\\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him.\\nHe was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.\\nHe did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.\\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:  \"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.\\nYou were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\nAre not you curious to hear how it was managed?\"\\n\"No really.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.\"\\n\"La!\\nYou are so strange!\\nBut I must tell you how it went off.\\nWe were married, you know, at St.\\nClement\\'s, because Wickham\\'s lodgings were in that parish.\\nAnd it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o\\'clock.\\nMy uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.\\nWell, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!\\nI was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.\\nAnd there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.\\nHowever, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.\\nI longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\"\\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.\\nIf you\\'ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.\\nNot one party, or scheme, or anything.\\nTo be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.\\nWell, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr.\\nStone.\\nAnd then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.\\nWell, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.\\nBut, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes\\' time, and then we all set out.\\nHowever, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr.\\nDarcy might have done as well.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nDarcy.\"\\nrepeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\n\"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.\\nBut gracious me!\\nI quite forgot!\\nI ought not to have said a word about it.\\nI promised them so faithfully!\\nWhat will Wickham say?\\nIt was to be such a secret.\"\\n\"If it was to be secret.\"\\nsaid Jane, \"say not another word on the subject.\\nYou may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\\n\"Oh!\\ncertainly.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \"we will ask you no questions.\"\\n\"Thank you.\"\\nsaid Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.\\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.\\nMr.\\nDarcy had been at her sister\\'s wedding.\\nIt was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\\nConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.\\nThose that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.\\nShe could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.\\n\"You may readily comprehend.\"\\nshe added, \"what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.\\nPray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\"\\n\"Not that I _shall_, though.\"\\nshe added to herself, as she finished the letter; \"and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.\"\\nJane\\'s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\nShe was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\n\"Gracechurch street, Sept.\\n6.\\n\"MY DEAR NIECE,  \"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.\\nI must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\\nDon\\'t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side.\\nIf you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.\\nYour uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done.\\nBut if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.\\n\"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.\\nMr.\\nDarcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.\\nIt was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been.\\nHe came to tell Mr.\\nGardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr.\\nWickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\\nFrom what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.\\nThe motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham\\'s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him.\\nHe generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world.\\nHis character was to speak for itself.\\nHe called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.\\nIf he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.\\nHe had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.\\n\"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs.\\nYounge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.\\nShe then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.\\nThis Mrs.\\nYounge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town.\\nBut it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.\\nShe would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.\\nWickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.\\nAt length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.\\nThey were in ---- street.\\nHe saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\\nHis first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.\\nBut he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.\\nShe cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.\\nShe was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.\\nSince such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design.\\nHe confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\\'s flight on her own folly alone.\\nHe meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.\\nHe must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.\\n\"Mr.\\nDarcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.\\nThough Mr.\\nBennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.\\nBut he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.\\nUnder such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\\n\"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\nWickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.\\n\"Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home.\\nBut Mr.\\nGardiner could not be seen, and Mr.\\nDarcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.\\nHe did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former.\\nHe did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.\\n\"On Saturday he came again.\\nYour father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.\\n\"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too.\\nIt was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.\\nBut our visitor was very obstinate.\\nI fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all.\\nHe has been accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.\\nNothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.\\n\"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.\\nBut at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\nBut, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.\\n\"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.\\nHis debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased.\\nThe reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above.\\nIt was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham\\'s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.\\nPerhaps there was some truth in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody\\'s_ reserve, can be answerable for the event.\\nBut in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair.\\n\"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.\\n\"I believe I have now told you every thing.\\nIt is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.\\nLydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.\\n_He_ was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane\\'s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.\\nI talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.\\nIf she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.\\nI was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.\\n\"Mr.\\nDarcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding.\\nHe dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.\\nWill you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.\\nHis behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\\nHis understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.\\nI thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name.\\nBut slyness seems the fashion.\\n\"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P.\\nI shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park.\\nA low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.\\n\"But I must write no more.\\nThe children have been wanting me this half hour.\\n\"Yours, very sincerely,  \"M.\\nGARDINER.\"\\nThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.\\nThe vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr.\\nDarcy might have been doing to forward her sister\\'s match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!\\nHe had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.\\nHe had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.\\nHer heart did whisper that he had done it for her.\\nBut it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.\\nBrother-in-law of Wickham!\\nEvery kind of pride must revolt from the connection.\\nHe had, to be sure, done much.\\nShe was ashamed to think how much.\\nBut he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.\\nIt was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.\\nIt was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.\\nThey owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him.\\nOh!\\nhow heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.\\nFor herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.\\nProud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.\\nShe read over her aunt\\'s commendation of him again and again.\\nIt was hardly enough; but it pleased her.\\nShe was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr.\\nDarcy and herself.\\nShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one\\'s approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.\\n\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\"\\nsaid he, as he joined her.\\n\"You certainly do.\"\\nshe replied with a smile; \"but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\\n\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were.\\nWe were always good friends; and now we are better.\"\\n\"True.\\nAre the others coming out?\"\\n\"I do not know.\\nMrs.\\nBennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.\\nAnd so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\\nShe replied in the affirmative.\\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.\\nAnd you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?\\nPoor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.\\nBut of course she did not mention my name to you.\"\\n\"Yes, she did.\"\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well.\\nAt such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\nhe replied, biting his lips.\\nElizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:  \"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.\\nWe passed each other several times.\\nI wonder what he can be doing there.\"\\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth.\\n\"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.\"\\n\"Undoubtedly.\\nDid you see him while you were at Lambton?\\nI thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\\n\"And do you like her?\"\\n\"Very much.\"\\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.\\nWhen I last saw her, she was not very promising.\\nI am very glad you liked her.\\nI hope she will turn out well.\"\\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.\\nA most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House!\\nIt would have suited me in every respect.\"\\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\\n\"Exceedingly well.\\nI should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.\\nOne ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!\\nThe quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness!\\nBut it was not to be.\\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?\"\\n\"I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\"\\n\"You have.\\nYes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember.\"\\n\"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.\"\\n\"You did!\\nand it was not wholly without foundation.\\nYou may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\"\\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister\\'s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:  \"Come, Mr.\\nWickham, we are brother and sister, you know.\\nDo not let us quarrel about the past.\\nIn future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.\"\\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\nWickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\nThe day of his and Lydia\\'s departure soon came, and Mrs.\\nBennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\n\"Oh!\\nmy dear Lydia.\"\\nshe cried, \"when shall we meet again?\"\\n\"Oh, lord!\\nI don\\'t know.\\nNot these two or three years, perhaps.\"\\n\"Write to me very often, my dear.\"\\n\"As often as I can.\\nBut you know married women have never much time for writing.\\nMy sisters may write to _me_.\\nThey will have nothing else to do.\"\\nMr.\\nWickham\\'s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife\\'s.\\nHe smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\n\"He is as fine a fellow.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nBennet, as soon as they were out of the house, \"as ever I saw.\\nHe simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.\\nI am prodigiously proud of him.\\nI defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\"\\nThe loss of her daughter made Mrs.\\nBennet very dull for several days.\\n\"I often think.\"\\nsaid she, \"that there is nothing so bad as parting with one\\'s friends.\\nOne seems so forlorn without them.\"\\n\"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth.\\n\"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.\"\\n\"It is no such thing.\\nLydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband\\'s regiment happens to be so far off.\\nIf that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\"\\nBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation.\\nThe housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.\\nMrs.\\nBennet was quite in the fidgets.\\nShe looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.\\n\"Well, well, and so Mr.\\nBingley is coming down, sister.\"\\n(for Mrs.\\nPhillips first brought her the news).\\n\"Well, so much the better.\\nNot that I care about it, though.\\nHe is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.\\nBut, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.\\nAnd who knows what _may_ happen?\\nBut that is nothing to us.\\nYou know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.\\nAnd so, is it quite certain he is coming?\"\\n\"You may depend on it.\"\\nreplied the other, \"for Mrs.\\nNicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.\\nHe comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.\\nShe was going to the butcher\\'s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"\\nMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour.\\nIt was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:  \"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.\\nBut don\\'t imagine it was from any silly cause.\\nI was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.\\nI do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.\\nI am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.\\nNot that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people\\'s remarks.\"\\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it.\\nHad she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend\\'s permission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\n\"Yet it is hard.\"\\nshe sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!\\nI _will_ leave him to himself.\"\\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.\\nThey were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.\\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\n\"As soon as ever Mr.\\nBingley comes, my dear.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet, \"you will wait on him of course.\"\\n\"No, no.\\nYou forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.\\nBut it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\\'s errand again.\"\\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.\\n\"\\'Tis an etiquette I despise.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"If he wants our society, let him seek it.\\nHe knows where we live.\\nI will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.\"\\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.\\nBut, however, that shan\\'t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.\\nWe must have Mrs.\\nLong and the Gouldings soon.\\nThat will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.\"\\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband\\'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr.\\nBingley, in consequence of it, before _they_ did.\\nAs the day of his arrival drew near,--  \"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all.\"\\nsaid Jane to her sister.\\n\"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.\\nMy mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says.\\nHappy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over.\"\\n\"I wish I could say anything to comfort you.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth; \"but it is wholly out of my power.\\nYou must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.\"\\nMr.\\nBingley arrived.\\nMrs.\\nBennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could.\\nShe counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.\\nBut on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.\\nHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.\\nJane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr.\\nDarcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma.\"\\nsaid Kitty; \"who can it be?\"\\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.\"\\n\"La.\"\\nreplied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.\\nMr.\\nwhat\\'s-his-name.\\nThat tall, proud man.\"\\n\"Good gracious!\\nMr.\\nDarcy!--and so it does, I vow.\\nWell, any friend of Mr.\\nBingley\\'s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.\\nShe knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.\\nBoth sisters were uncomfortable enough.\\nEach felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr.\\nDarcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr.\\nBingley\\'s friend, without being heard by either of them.\\nBut Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\\nGardiner\\'s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\\nTo Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.\\nHer astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.\\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.\\nBut she would not be secure.\\n\"Let me first see how he behaves.\"\\nsaid she; \"it will then be early enough for expectation.\"\\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door.\\nJane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.\\nOn the gentlemen\\'s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.\\nShe had ventured only one glance at Darcy.\\nHe looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.\\nBut, perhaps he could not in her mother\\'s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.\\nIt was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.\\nHe was received by Mrs.\\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.\\nElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.\\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nGardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything.\\nHe was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.\\nThere he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.\\nBut now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.\\nMore thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.\\nShe was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.\\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"Yet why did he come?\"\\nShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\nShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\n\"It is a long time, Mr.\\nBingley, since you went away.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet.\\nHe readily agreed to it.\\n\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.\\nPeople _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.\\nA great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.\\nMiss Lucas is married and settled.\\nAnd one of my own daughters.\\nI suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.\\nIt was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.\\nIt was only said, \\'Lately, George Wickham, Esq.\\nto Miss Lydia Bennet,\\' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\\nIt was my brother Gardiner\\'s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.\\nDid you see it?\"\\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\nElizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.\\nHow Mr.\\nDarcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.\\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married.\"\\ncontinued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr.\\nBingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.\\nThey are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long.\\nHis regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.\\nThank Heaven!\\nhe has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.\"\\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr.\\nDarcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\\nIt drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.\\nA few weeks, he believed.\\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr.\\nBingley.\"\\nsaid her mother, \"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\\nBennet\\'s manor.\\nI am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.\"\\nElizabeth\\'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!\\nWere the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.\\nAt that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.\\n\"The first wish of my heart.\"\\nsaid she to herself, \"is never more to be in company with either of them.\\nTheir society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this!\\nLet me never see either one or the other again.\"\\nYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.\\nWhen first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.\\nHe found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.\\nJane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.\\nBut her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.\\nWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.\\nBennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.\\n\"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr.\\nBingley.\"\\nshe added, \"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.\\nI have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.\"\\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\nThey then went away.\\nMrs.\\nBennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.\\nMr.\\nDarcy\\'s behaviour astonished and vexed her.\\n\"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent.\"\\nsaid she, \"did he come at all?\"\\nShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\n\"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?\\nIf he fears me, why come hither?\\nIf he no longer cares for me, why silent?\\nTeasing, teasing, man!\\nI will think no more about him.\"\\nHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\\n\"Now.\"\\nsaid she, \"that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.\\nI know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.\\nI am glad he dines here on Tuesday.\\nIt will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\"\\n\"Yes, very indifferent indeed.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, laughingly.\\n\"Oh, Jane, take care.\"\\n\"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?\"\\n\"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.\"\\n* * * * *  They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.\\nBennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour\\'s visit, had revived.\\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.\\nWhen they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.\\nHer prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.\\nOn entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.\\nHe placed himself by her.\\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.\\nHe bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr.\\nDarcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.\\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane\\'s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.\\nThough she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.\\nIt gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.\\nMr.\\nDarcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them.\\nHe was on one side of her mother.\\nShe knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.\\nShe was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did.\\nHer mother\\'s ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth\\'s mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.\\nAnxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\\n\"If he does not come to me, _then_.\"\\nsaid she, \"I shall give him up for ever.\"\\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!\\nthe ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair.\\nAnd on the gentlemen\\'s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:  \"The men shan\\'t come and part us, I am determined.\\nWe want none of them; do we?\"\\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room.\\nShe followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!\\n\"A man who has once been refused!\\nHow could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?\\nIs there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.\"\\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:  \"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\\n\"And quite alone?\\nHave all her friends left her?\"\\n\"Mrs.\\nAnnesley is with her.\\nThe others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.\"\\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.\\nHe stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady\\'s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother\\'s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.\\nShe now lost every expectation of pleasure.\\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\nMrs.\\nBennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\n\"Well girls.\"\\nsaid she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \"What say you to the day?\\nI think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.\\nThe dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.\\nThe venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.\\nThe soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases\\' last week; and even Mr.\\nDarcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.\\nAnd, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.\\nMrs.\\nLong said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.\\nAnd what do you think she said besides?\\n\\'Ah!\\nMrs.\\nBennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\\' She did indeed.\\nI do think Mrs.\\nLong is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\\nMrs.\\nBennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley\\'s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\\n\"It has been a very agreeable day.\"\\nsaid Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.\\n\"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.\\nI hope we may often meet again.\"\\nElizabeth smiled.\\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so.\\nYou must not suspect me.\\nIt mortifies me.\\nI assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.\\nI am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.\\nIt is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.\"\\n\"You are very cruel.\"\\nsaid her sister, \"you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\"\\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed.\"\\n\"And how impossible in others.\"\\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?\"\\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.\\nWe all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.\\nForgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.\"\\nBingley called again, and alone.\\nHis friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.\\nHe sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.\\nMrs.\\nBennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\\n\"Next time you call.\"\\nsaid she, \"I hope we shall be more lucky.\"\\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc.\\netc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.\\nHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed.\\nIn ran Mrs.\\nBennet to her daughter\\'s room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:  \"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.\\nHe is come--Mr.\\nBingley is come.\\nHe is, indeed.\\nMake haste, make haste.\\nHere, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.\\nNever mind Miss Lizzy\\'s hair.\"\\n\"We will be down as soon as we can.\"\\nsaid Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nhang Kitty!\\nwhat has she to do with it?\\nCome be quick, be quick!\\nWhere is your sash, my dear?\"\\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.\\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening.\\nAfter tea, Mr.\\nBennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.\\nTwo obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs.\\nBennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.\\nElizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma?\\nWhat do you keep winking at me for?\\nWhat am I to do?\"\\n\"Nothing child, nothing.\\nI did not wink at you.\"\\nShe then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you.\"\\ntook her out of the room.\\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it.\\nIn a few minutes, Mrs.\\nBennet half-opened the door and called out:  \"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\\nElizabeth was forced to go.\\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know.\"\\nsaid her mother, as soon as she was in the hall.\\n\"Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room.\"\\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.\\nMrs.\\nBennet\\'s schemes for this day were ineffectual.\\nBingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.\\nHis ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.\\nNot a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr.\\nDarcy returned within the stated time.\\nSeriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman\\'s concurrence.\\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr.\\nBennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.\\nThe latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.\\nThere was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him.\\nBingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.\\nElizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother\\'s schemes.\\nBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.\\nOn opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all.\\nTheir situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought was still worse.\\nNot a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\\n\"\\'Tis too much.\"\\nshe added, \"by far too much.\\nI do not deserve it.\\nOh!\\nwhy is not everybody as happy?\"\\nElizabeth\\'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.\\nEvery sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.\\nBut she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.\\n\"I must go instantly to my mother.\"\\nshe cried.\\n\"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself.\\nHe is gone to my father already.\\nOh!\\nLizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!\\nhow shall I bear so much happiness.\"\\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\n\"And this.\"\\nsaid she, \"is the end of all his friend\\'s anxious circumspection!\\nof all his sister\\'s falsehood and contrivance!\\nthe happiest, wisest, most reasonable end.\"\\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.\\n\"Where is your sister?\"\\nsaid he hastily, as he opened the door.\\n\"With my mother up stairs.\\nShe will be down in a moment, I dare say.\"\\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.\\nElizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.\\nThey shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\\'s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.\\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet\\'s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\nKitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\nMrs.\\nBennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr.\\nBennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.\\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:  \"Jane, I congratulate you.\\nYou will be a very happy woman.\"\\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.\\n\"You are a good girl.\"\\nhe replied, \"and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.\\nI have not a doubt of your doing very well together.\\nYour tempers are by no means unlike.\\nYou are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.\"\\n\"I hope not so.\\nImprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me.\"\\n\"Exceed their income!\\nMy dear Mr.\\nBennet.\"\\ncried his wife, \"what are you talking of?\\nWhy, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.\"\\nThen addressing her daughter, \"Oh!\\nmy dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!\\nI am sure I shan\\'t get a wink of sleep all night.\\nI knew how it would be.\\nI always said it must be so, at last.\\nI was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!\\nI remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.\\nOh!\\nhe is the handsomest young man that ever was seen.\"\\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.\\nJane was beyond competition her favourite child.\\nAt that moment, she cared for no other.\\nHer younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.\\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.\\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.\\nIn the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\\n\"He has made me so happy.\"\\nsaid she, one evening, \"by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!\\nI had not believed it possible.\"\\n\"I suspected as much.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth.\\n\"But how did he account for it?\"\\n\"It must have been his sister\\'s doing.\\nThey were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.\\nBut when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.\"\\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"that I ever heard you utter.\\nGood girl!\\nIt would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley\\'s pretended regard.\"\\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again.\"\\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.\"\\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.\\nElizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed.\"\\ncried Jane.\\n\"Oh!\\nLizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!\\nIf I could but see _you_ as happy!\\nIf there _were_ but such another man for you.\"\\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.\\nTill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.\\nNo, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.\\nCollins in time.\"\\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.\\nMrs.\\nBennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.\\nPhillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\\nIt was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.\\nAs it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.\\nThey both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered.\\nIt was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth\\'s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\nElizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship\\'s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.\\nMrs.\\nBennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.\\nAfter sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,  \"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.\\nThat lady, I suppose, is your mother.\"\\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\n\"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\\n\"Yes, madam.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.\\n\"She is my youngest girl but one.\\nMy youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\"\\n\"You have a very small park here.\"\\nreturned Lady Catherine after a short silence.\\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas\\'s.\"\\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west.\"\\nMrs.\\nBennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:  \"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nCollins well.\"\\n\"Yes, very well.\\nI saw them the night before last.\"\\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.\\nBut no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\nMrs.\\nBennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,  \"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.\\nI should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.\"\\n\"Go, my dear.\"\\ncried her mother, \"and show her ladyship about the different walks.\\nI think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\"\\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs.\\nAs they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.\\nThey proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.\\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\"\\nsaid she, as she looked in her face.\\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:--  \"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.\\nYour own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.\"\\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.\\nI have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.\"\\n\"Miss Bennet.\"\\nreplied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.\\nBut however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.\\nMy character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.\\nA report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago.\\nI was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nThough I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\"\\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.\\nWhat could your ladyship propose by it?\"\\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.\"\\n\"If!\\nDo you then pretend to be ignorant of it?\\nHas it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?\\nDo you not know that such a report is spread abroad?\"\\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\"\\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.\\nYou may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\"\\n\"This is not to be borne.\\nMiss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.\\nHas he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\"\\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.\\nBut your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.\\nYou may have drawn him in.\"\\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?\\nI have not been accustomed to such language as this.\\nI am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\\n\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\\n\"Let me be rightly understood.\\nThis match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.\\nNo, never.\\nMr.\\nDarcy is engaged to my daughter.\\nNow what have you to say?\"\\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.\"\\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:  \"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.\\nFrom their infancy, they have been intended for each other.\\nIt was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers.\\nWhile in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!\\nDo you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh?\\nAre you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?\\nHave you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\"\\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before.\\nBut what is that to me?\\nIf there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh.\\nYou both did as much as you could in planning the marriage.\\nIts completion depended on others.\\nIf Mr.\\nDarcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?\\nAnd if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\nYes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.\\nYou will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.\"\\n\"These are heavy misfortunes.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth.\\n\"But the wife of Mr.\\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\"\\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl!\\nI am ashamed of you!\\nIs this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?\\nIs nothing due to me on that score?\\nLet us sit down.\\nYou are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.\\nI have not been used to submit to any person\\'s whims.\\nI have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\\n\"_That_ will make your ladyship\\'s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.\"\\n\"I will not be interrupted.\\nHear me in silence.\\nMy daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.\\nThey are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father\\'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families.\\nTheir fortune on both sides is splendid.\\nThey are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\\nThe upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.\\nIs this to be endured!\\nBut it must not, shall not be.\\nIf you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.\"\\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.\\nHe is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\\'s daughter; so far we are equal.\"\\n\"True.\\nYou _are_ a gentleman\\'s daughter.\\nBut who was your mother?\\nWho are your uncles and aunts?\\nDo not imagine me ignorant of their condition.\"\\n\"Whatever my connections may be.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\"\\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment\\'s deliberation:  \"I am not.\"\\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\"\\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.\\nI expected to find a more reasonable young woman.\\nBut do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.\\nI shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.\"\\n\"And I certainly _never_ shall give it.\\nI am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.\\nYour ladyship wants Mr.\\nDarcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable?\\nSupposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\\nAllow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.\\nYou have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.\\nI must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\"\\n\"Not so hasty, if you please.\\nI have by no means done.\\nTo all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.\\nI am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister\\'s infamous elopement.\\nI know it all; that the young man\\'s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.\\nAnd is such a girl to be my nephew\\'s sister?\\nIs her husband, is the son of his late father\\'s steward, to be his brother?\\nHeaven and earth!--of what are you thinking?\\nAre the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\"\\n\"You can now have nothing further to say.\"\\nshe resentfully answered.\\n\"You have insulted me in every possible method.\\nI must beg to return to the house.\"\\nAnd she rose as she spoke.\\nLady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.\\nHer ladyship was highly incensed.\\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\\nUnfeeling, selfish girl!\\nDo you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\"\\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say.\\nYou know my sentiments.\"\\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\\n\"I have said no such thing.\\nI am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\"\\n\"It is well.\\nYou refuse, then, to oblige me.\\nYou refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.\\nYou are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\"\\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth, \"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.\\nNo principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nAnd with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment\\'s concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.\"\\n\"And this is your real opinion!\\nThis is your final resolve!\\nVery well.\\nI shall now know how to act.\\nDo not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.\\nI came to try you.\\nI hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.\"\\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, \"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.\\nI send no compliments to your mother.\\nYou deserve no such attention.\\nI am most seriously displeased.\"\\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.\\nShe heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.\\nHer mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.\\n\"She did not choose it.\"\\nsaid her daughter, \"she would go.\"\\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman!\\nand her calling here was prodigiously civil!\\nfor she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.\\nShe is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.\\nI suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\"\\nElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\nLady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nIt was a rational scheme, to be sure!\\nbut from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea.\\nShe had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.\\nAnd her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.\\nIn revolving Lady Catherine\\'s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.\\nFrom what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.\\nShe knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.\\nWith his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\\nIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.\\nIn that case he would return no more.\\nLady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days.\"\\nshe added, \"I shall know how to understand it.\\nI shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.\\nIf he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\"\\n* * * * *  The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\\nThe next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\n\"Lizzy.\"\\nsaid he, \"I was going to look for you; come into my room.\"\\nShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.\\nIt suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.\\nHe then said,  \"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.\\nAs it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.\\nI did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony.\\nLet me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\"\\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth\\'s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued:  \"You look conscious.\\nYoung ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.\\nThis letter is from Mr.\\nCollins.\"\\n\"From Mr.\\nCollins!\\nand what can _he_ have to say?\"\\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course.\\nHe begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.\\nI shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.\\nWhat relates to yourself, is as follows: \\'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.\\nCollins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority.\\nYour daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.\\'\\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\"\\n\\'This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.\\nYet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman\\'s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.\\'\\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?\\nBut now it comes out:  \"\\'My motive for cautioning you is as follows.\\nWe have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.\\'\\n\"_Mr.\\nDarcy_, you see, is the man!\\nNow, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.\\nCould he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?\\nMr.\\nDarcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life!\\nIt is admirable.\"\\nElizabeth tried to join in her father\\'s pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.\\nNever had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\\n\"Oh!\\nyes.\\nPray read on.\"\\n\"\\'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.\\nI thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\\' Mr.\\nCollins moreover adds, \\'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia\\'s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known.\\nI must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.\\nIt was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.\\nYou ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.\\' That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!\\nThe rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte\\'s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.\\nBut, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.\\nYou are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.\\nFor what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?\"\\n\"Oh.\"\\ncried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted.\\nBut it is so strange.\"\\n\"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.\\nHad they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!\\nMuch as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr.\\nCollins\\'s correspondence for any consideration.\\nNay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.\\nAnd pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?\\nDid she call to refuse her consent?\"\\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.\\nElizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr.\\nDarcy\\'s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\\nBingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine\\'s visit.\\nThe gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.\\nBennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.\\nIt was agreed to.\\nMrs.\\nBennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.\\nBingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.\\nThey lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\\nVery little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\\nThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.\\nNow was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said:  \"Mr.\\nDarcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours.\\nI can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.\\nEver since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.\\nWere it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry.\"\\nreplied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.\\nI did not think Mrs.\\nGardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\\n\"You must not blame my aunt.\\nLydia\\'s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.\\nLet me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.\"\\n\"If you _will_ thank me.\"\\nhe replied, \"let it be for yourself alone.\\nThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.\\nBut your _family_ owe me nothing.\\nMuch as I respect them, I believe I thought only of _you_.\"\\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.\\nAfter a short pause, her companion added, \"You are too generous to trifle with me.\\nIf your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.\\n_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.\"\\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances.\\nThe happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.\\nHad Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.\\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction.\\nThere was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.\\nShe soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship\\'s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give.\\nBut, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\\n\"It taught me to hope.\"\\nsaid he, \"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.\\nI knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_.\\nAfter abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.\"\\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?\\nFor, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof.\\nIt was unpardonable.\\nI cannot think of it without abhorrence.\"\\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth.\\n\"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.\"\\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.\\nThe recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.\\nYour reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: \\'had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.\\' Those were your words.\\nYou know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\"\\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.\\nI had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.\"\\n\"I can easily believe it.\\nYou thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.\\nThe turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.\"\\n\"Oh!\\ndo not repeat what I then said.\\nThese recollections will not do at all.\\nI assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\"\\nDarcy mentioned his letter.\\n\"Did it.\"\\nsaid he, \"did it soon make you think better of me?\\nDid you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?\"\\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\\n\"I knew.\"\\nsaid he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.\\nI hope you have destroyed the letter.\\nThere was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.\\nI can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\"\\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\"\\n\"When I wrote that letter.\"\\nreplied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.\\nThe adieu is charity itself.\\nBut think no more of the letter.\\nThe feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten.\\nYou must learn some of my philosophy.\\nThink only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.\"\\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\\nYour retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence.\\nBut with me, it is not so.\\nPainful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled.\\nI have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.\\nAs a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper.\\nI was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\\nUnfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.\\nSuch I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!\\nWhat do I not owe you!\\nYou taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.\\nBy you, I was properly humbled.\\nI came to you without a doubt of my reception.\\nYou showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\\n\"Indeed I had.\\nWhat will you think of my vanity?\\nI believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\"\\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you.\\nI never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.\\nHow you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\"\\n\"Hate you!\\nI was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.\"\\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley.\\nYou blamed me for coming?\"\\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\"\\n\"My object then.\"\\nreplied Darcy, \"was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.\\nHow soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.\"\\nHe then told her of Georgiana\\'s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.\\n\"What could become of Mr.\\nBingley and Jane.\"\\nwas a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs.\\nDarcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.\\n\"I must ask whether you were surprised?\"\\nsaid Elizabeth.\\n\"Not at all.\\nWhen I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\"\\n\"That is to say, you had given your permission.\\nI guessed as much.\"\\nAnd though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.\\n\"On the evening before my going to London.\"\\nsaid he, \"I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.\\nI told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.\\nHis surprise was great.\\nHe had never had the slightest suspicion.\\nI told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\"\\nElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.\\n\"Did you speak from your own observation.\"\\nsaid she, \"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\"\\n\"From the former.\\nI had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.\"\\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.\"\\n\"It did.\\nBingley is most unaffectedly modest.\\nHis diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.\\nI was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.\\nI could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.\\nHe was angry.\\nBut his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister\\'s sentiments.\\nHe has heartily forgiven me now.\"\\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr.\\nBingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.\\nShe remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin.\\nIn anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.\\nIn the hall they parted.\\nwas a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.\\nShe had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.\\nShe coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.\\nThe acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.\\nDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.\\nShe anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane.\\nThough suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet\\'s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\\n\"You are joking, Lizzy.\\nThis cannot be!--engaged to Mr.\\nDarcy!\\nNo, no, you shall not deceive me.\\nI know it to be impossible.\"\\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed!\\nMy sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.\\nYet, indeed, I am in earnest.\\nI speak nothing but the truth.\\nHe still loves me, and we are engaged.\"\\nJane looked at her doubtingly.\\n\"Oh, Lizzy!\\nit cannot be.\\nI know how much you dislike him.\"\\n\"You know nothing of the matter.\\n_That_ is all to be forgot.\\nPerhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.\\nBut in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.\\nThis is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.\"\\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement.\\nElizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.\\n\"Good Heaven!\\ncan it be really so!\\nYet now I must believe you.\"\\ncried Jane.\\n\"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain?\\nforgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?\"\\n\"There can be no doubt of that.\\nIt is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.\\nBut are you pleased, Jane?\\nShall you like to have such a brother?\"\\n\"Very, very much.\\nNothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.\\nBut we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.\\nAnd do you really love him quite well enough?\\nOh, Lizzy!\\ndo anything rather than marry without affection.\\nAre you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?\"\\n\"Oh, yes!\\nYou will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all.\"\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.\\nI am afraid you will be angry.\"\\n\"My dearest sister, now _be_ serious.\\nI want to talk very seriously.\\nLet me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.\\nWill you tell me how long you have loved him?\"\\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.\\nBut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.\"\\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.\\nWhen convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.\\n\"Now I am quite happy.\"\\nsaid she, \"for you will be as happy as myself.\\nI always had a value for him.\\nWere it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\\'s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.\\nBut Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.\\nHow little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!\\nI owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.\"\\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.\\nShe had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.\\nBut now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia\\'s marriage.\\nAll was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.\\n* * * * *  \"Good gracious.\"\\ncried Mrs.\\nBennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, \"if that disagreeable Mr.\\nDarcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley!\\nWhat can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?\\nI had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.\\nWhat shall we do with him?\\nLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\\'s way.\"\\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.\\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs.\\nBennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\\n\"I advise Mr.\\nDarcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nBennet, \"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.\\nIt is a nice long walk, and Mr.\\nDarcy has never seen the view.\"\\n\"It may do very well for the others.\"\\nreplied Mr.\\nBingley; \"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.\\nWon\\'t it, Kitty?\"\\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home.\\nDarcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.\\nAs she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.\\nBennet followed her, saying:  \"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.\\nBut I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane\\'s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.\\nSo, do not put yourself to inconvenience.\"\\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr.\\nBennet\\'s consent should be asked in the course of the evening.\\nElizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother\\'s.\\nShe could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.\\nBut whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr.\\nDarcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.\\n* * * * *  In the evening, soon after Mr.\\nBennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr.\\nDarcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.\\nShe did not fear her father\\'s opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr.\\nDarcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.\\nIn a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he wants you in the library.\"\\nShe was gone directly.\\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\\n\"Lizzy.\"\\nsaid he, \"what are you doing?\\nAre you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?\\nHave not you always hated him?\"\\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!\\nIt would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr.\\nDarcy.\\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.\\nHe is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\\nBut will they make you happy?\"\\n\"Have you any other objection.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"than your belief of my indifference?\"\\n\"None at all.\\nWe all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\\n\"I do, I do like him.\"\\nshe replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I love him.\\nIndeed he has no improper pride.\\nHe is perfectly amiable.\\nYou do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.\"\\n\"Lizzy.\"\\nsaid her father, \"I have given him my consent.\\nHe is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask.\\nI now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.\\nBut let me advise you to think better of it.\\nI know your disposition, Lizzy.\\nI know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.\\nYour lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.\\nYou could scarcely escape discredit and misery.\\nMy child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life.\\nYou know not what you are about.\"\\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr.\\nDarcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months\\' suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father\\'s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\n\"Well, my dear.\"\\nsaid he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no more to say.\\nIf this be the case, he deserves you.\\nI could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.\"\\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.\\nDarcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.\\nHe heard her with astonishment.\\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed!\\nAnd so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow\\'s debts, and got him his commission!\\nSo much the better.\\nIt will save me a world of trouble and economy.\\nHad it been your uncle\\'s doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.\\nI shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\"\\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr.\\nCollins\\'s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, \"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\"\\nElizabeth\\'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour\\'s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.\\nEvery thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.\\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.\\nIts effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.\\nBennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.\\nNor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.\\nShe began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\n\"Good gracious!\\nLord bless me!\\nonly think!\\ndear me!\\nMr.\\nDarcy!\\nWho would have thought it!\\nAnd is it really true?\\nOh!\\nmy sweetest Lizzy!\\nhow rich and how great you will be!\\nWhat pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!\\nJane\\'s is nothing to it--nothing at all.\\nI am so pleased--so happy.\\nSuch a charming man!--so handsome!\\nso tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy!\\npray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.\\nI hope he will overlook it.\\nDear, dear Lizzy.\\nA house in town!\\nEvery thing that is charming!\\nThree daughters married!\\nTen thousand a year!\\nOh, Lord!\\nWhat will become of me.\\nI shall go distracted.\"\\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.\\nBut before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\n\"My dearest child.\"\\nshe cried, \"I can think of nothing else!\\nTen thousand a year, and very likely more!\\n\\'Tis as good as a Lord!\\nAnd a special licence.\\nYou must and shall be married by a special licence.\\nBut my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr.\\nDarcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.\"\\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother\\'s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations\\' consent, there was still something to be wished for.\\nBut the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.\\nBennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.\\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr.\\nBennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane\\'s.\"\\nDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.\\n\"How could you begin?\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?\"\\n\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.\\nIt is too long ago.\\nI was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.\"\\n\"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.\\nNow be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?\"\\n\"For the liveliness of your mind, I did.\"\\n\"You may as well call it impertinence at once.\\nIt was very little less.\\nThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.\\nYou were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.\\nI roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.\\nHad you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.\\nThere--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.\\nTo be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.\"\\n\"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?\"\\n\"Dearest Jane!\\nwho could have done less for her?\\nBut make a virtue of it by all means.\\nMy good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.\\nWhat made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?\\nWhy, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?\"\\n\"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\"\\n\"But I was embarrassed.\"\\n\"And so was I.\"\\n\"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\"\\n\"A man who had felt less, might.\"\\n\"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!\\nBut I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.\\nI wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you!\\nMy resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.\\n_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise?\\nfor I ought not to have mentioned the subject.\\nThis will never do.\"\\n\"You need not distress yourself.\\nThe moral will be perfectly fair.\\nLady Catherine\\'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts.\\nI am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.\\nI was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours.\\nMy aunt\\'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\"\\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.\\nBut tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?\\nWas it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\\nor had you intended any more serious consequence?\"\\n\"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.\\nMy avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.\"\\n\"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?\"\\n\"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.\\nBut it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.\"\\n\"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.\\nBut I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.\"\\nFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.\\nDarcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.\\nGardiner\\'s long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:  \"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.\\nYou supposed more than really existed.\\nBut _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.\\nYou must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.\\nI thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.\\nHow could I be so silly as to wish it!\\nYour idea of the ponies is delightful.\\nWe will go round the Park every day.\\nI am the happiest creature in the world.\\nPerhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.\\nI am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.\\nMr.\\nDarcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me.\\nYou are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\\nYours, etc.\"\\nMr.\\nDarcy\\'s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what Mr.\\nBennet sent to Mr.\\nCollins, in reply to his last.\\n\"DEAR SIR,  \"I must trouble you once more for congratulations.\\nElizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr.\\nDarcy.\\nConsole Lady Catherine as well as you can.\\nBut, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.\\nHe has more to give.\\n\"Yours sincerely, etc.\"\\nMiss Bingley\\'s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.\\nShe wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.\\nJane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother\\'s in sending it.\\nFour sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr.\\nCollins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge.\\nThe reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.\\nLady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew\\'s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.\\nAt such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.\\nDarcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.\\nHe bore it, however, with admirable calmness.\\nHe could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St.\\nJames\\'s, with very decent composure.\\nIf he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\\nMrs.\\nPhillips\\'s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs.\\nPhillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley\\'s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.\\nNor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.\\nElizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.\\nBennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\nWith what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.\\nBingley, and talked of Mrs.\\nDarcy, may be guessed.\\nI wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.\\nMr.\\nBennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.\\nHe delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\\nMr.\\nBingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.\\nSo near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.\\nThe darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\\nKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.\\nIn society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.\\nShe was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia\\'s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.\\nFrom the further disadvantage of Lydia\\'s society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.\\nWickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\\nMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.\\nBennet\\'s being quite unable to sit alone.\\nMary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\\' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.\\nAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.\\nHe bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.\\nThe congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.\\nThe letter was to this effect:  \"MY DEAR LIZZY,  \"I wish you joy.\\nIf you love Mr.\\nDarcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy.\\nIt is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.\\nI am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.\\nAny place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr.\\nDarcy about it, if you had rather not.\\n\"Yours, etc.\"\\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.\\nIt had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.\\nTheir manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.\\nThey were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.\\nHis affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.\\nThough Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth\\'s sake, he assisted him further in his profession.\\nLydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\\'s good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\\nMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\\'s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\nPemberley was now Georgiana\\'s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.\\nThey were able to love each other even as well as they intended.\\nGeorgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.\\nHe, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.\\nHer mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.\\nBy Elizabeth\\'s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.\\nBut at length, by Elizabeth\\'s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.\\nDarcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\\n\\nProduced by David Widger      ADVENTURES  OF  HUCKLEBERRY FINN  (Tom Sawyer\\'s Comrade)  By Mark Twain  Complete     CONTENTS.\\nCivilizing Huck.\\nMiss Watson.\\nTom Sawyer

\\xa0the Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the ordinary \"Pike Count.\"\\ndialect; and four modified varieties of this last.\\nThe shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.\\nI make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding.\\nTHE AUTHOR.\\nYOU don\\'t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain\\'t no matter.\\n\\xa0That book was made by Mr.\\nMark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.\\n\\xa0There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.\\n\\xa0That is nothing.\\n\\xa0I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.\\n\\xa0Aunt Polly Tom\\'s Aunt Polly, she is and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\\nNow the way that the book winds up is this: \\xa0Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.\\n\\xa0We got six thousand dollars apiece all gold.\\n\\xa0It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up.\\n\\xa0Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round more than a body could tell what to do with.\\n\\xa0The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn\\'t stand it no longer I lit out.\\n\\xa0I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied.\\n\\xa0But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable.\\n\\xa0So I went back.\\nThe widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.\\nShe put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn\\'t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.\\n\\xa0Well, then, the old thing commenced again.\\n\\xa0The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time.\\nWhen you got to the table you couldn\\'t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn\\'t really anything the matter with them, that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.\\n\\xa0In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\\nAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn\\'t care no more about him, because I don\\'t take no stock in dead people.\\nPretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.\\n\\xa0But she wouldn\\'t.\\n\\xa0She said it was a mean practice and wasn\\'t clean, and I must try to not do it any more.\\n\\xa0That is just the way with some people.\\n\\xa0They get down on a thing when they don\\'t know nothing about it.\\n\\xa0Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it.\\n\\xa0And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.\\nHer sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book.\\nShe worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t stood it much longer.\\n\\xa0Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.\\n\\xa0Miss Watson would say, \"Don\\'t put your feet up there, Huckleberry.\"\\nand \"Don\\'t scrunch up like that, Huckleberry set up straight.\"\\nand pretty soon she would say, \"Don\\'t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry why don\\'t you try to behave?\"\\n\\xa0Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there.\\nShe got mad then, but I didn\\'t mean no harm.\\n\\xa0All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn\\'t particular.\\n\\xa0She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn\\'t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\\n\\xa0Well, I couldn\\'t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn\\'t try for it.\\n\\xa0But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn\\'t do no good.\\nNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place.\\n\\xa0She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.\\n\\xa0So I didn\\'t think much of it.\\nBut I never said so.\\n\\xa0I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.\\n\\xa0I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\\nMiss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\\n\\xa0By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed.\\n\\xa0I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table.\\n\\xa0Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\\'t no use.\\n\\xa0I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead.\\n\\xa0The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\\'t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me.\\nThen away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that\\'s on its mind and can\\'t make itself understood, and so can\\'t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving.\\n\\xa0I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me.\\nI got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.\\n\\xa0But I hadn\\'t no confidence.\\n\\xa0You do that when you\\'ve lost a horseshoe that you\\'ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn\\'t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you\\'d killed a spider.\\nI set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn\\'t know.\\nWell, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom boom boom twelve licks; and all still again stiller than ever.\\nPretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees something was a stirring.\\n\\xa0I set still and listened.\\n\\xa0Directly I could just barely hear a \"me-yow!\\nme-yow.\"\\ndown there.\\n\\xa0That was good!\\n\\xa0Says I, \"me-yow!\\nme-yow.\"\\nas soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.\\n\\xa0Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\\nWE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow\\'s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\\'t scrape our heads.\\nWhen we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise.\\n\\xa0We scrouched down and laid still.\\n\\xa0Miss Watson\\'s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him.\\n\\xa0He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening.\\n\\xa0Then he says:  \"Who dah?\"\\nHe listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly.\\n\\xa0Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn\\'t a sound, and we all there so close together.\\n\\xa0There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn\\'t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders.\\n\\xa0Seemed like I\\'d die if I couldn\\'t scratch.\\n\\xa0Well, I\\'ve noticed that thing plenty times since.\\n\\xa0If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain\\'t sleepy if you are anywheres where it won\\'t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places.\\nPretty soon Jim says:  \"Say, who is you?\\n\\xa0Whar is you?\\n\\xa0Dog my cats ef I didn\\' hear sumf\\'n.\\nWell, I know what I\\'s gwyne to do: \\xa0I\\'s gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.\"\\nSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.\\n\\xa0He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine.\\n\\xa0My nose begun to itch.\\n\\xa0It itched till the tears come into my eyes.\\n\\xa0But I dasn\\'t scratch.\\n\\xa0Then it begun to itch on the inside.\\nNext I got to itching underneath.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t know how I was going to set still.\\nThis miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that.\\n\\xa0I was itching in eleven different places now.\\n\\xa0I reckoned I couldn\\'t stand it more\\'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.\\n\\xa0Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.\\nTom he made a sign to me kind of a little noise with his mouth and we went creeping away on our hands and knees.\\n\\xa0When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.\\n\\xa0But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they\\'d find out I warn\\'t in.\\nThen Tom said he hadn\\'t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t want him to try.\\n\\xa0I said Jim might wake up and come.\\n\\xa0But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\\nThen we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him.\\n\\xa0I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.\\nAs soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house.\\n\\xa0Tom said he slipped Jim\\'s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn\\'t wake.\\nAfterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.\\n\\xa0And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils.\\n\\xa0Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn\\'t hardly notice the other niggers.\\n\\xa0Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country.\\n\\xa0Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.\\n\\xa0Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, \"Hm!\\n\\xa0What you know \\'bout witches?\"\\nand that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.\\n\\xa0Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\\n\\xa0Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn\\'t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it.\\n\\xa0Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.\\nWell, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand.\\n\\xa0We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\\n\\xa0So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\\nWe went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes.\\n\\xa0Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees.\\n\\xa0We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up.\\nTom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn\\'t a noticed that there was a hole.\\n\\xa0We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.\\n\\xa0Tom says:  \"Now, we\\'ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer\\'s Gang.\\nEverybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.\"\\nEverybody was willing.\\n\\xa0So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it.\\n\\xa0It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn\\'t eat and he mustn\\'t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band.\\nAnd nobody that didn\\'t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed.\\n\\xa0And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.\\nEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head.\\n\\xa0He said, some of it, but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.\\nSome thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told the secrets.\\n\\xa0Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote it in.\\nThen Ben Rogers says:  \"Here\\'s Huck Finn, he hain\\'t got no family; what you going to do \\'bout him?\"\\n\"Well, hain\\'t he got a father?\"\\nsays Tom Sawyer.\\n\"Yes, he\\'s got a father, but you can\\'t never find him these days.\\n\\xa0He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain\\'t been seen in these parts for a year or more.\"\\nThey talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn\\'t be fair and square for the others.\\n\\xa0Well, nobody could think of anything to do everybody was stumped, and set still.\\n\\xa0I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson they could kill her.\\n\\xa0Everybody said:  \"Oh, she\\'ll do.\\n\\xa0That\\'s all right.\\n\\xa0Huck can come in.\"\\nThen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.\\n\"Now.\"\\nsays Ben Rogers, \"what\\'s the line of business of this Gang?\"\\n\"Nothing only robbery and murder.\"\\nTom said.\\n\"But who are we going to rob?\\nhouses, or cattle, or.\"\\n\"Stuff!\\nstealing cattle and such things ain\\'t robbery; it\\'s burglary.\"\\nsays Tom Sawyer.\\n\\xa0\"We ain\\'t burglars.\\n\\xa0That ain\\'t no sort of style.\\n\\xa0We are highwaymen.\\n\\xa0We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\"\\n\"Must we always kill the people?\"\\n\"Oh, certainly.\\n\\xa0It\\'s best.\\n\\xa0Some authorities think different, but mostly it\\'s considered best to kill them except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they\\'re ransomed.\"\\n\"Ransomed?\\n\\xa0What\\'s that?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\\n\\xa0But that\\'s what they do.\\n\\xa0I\\'ve seen it in books; and so of course that\\'s what we\\'ve got to do.\"\\n\"But how can we do it if we don\\'t know what it is?\"\\n\"Why, blame it all, we\\'ve _got_ to do it.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t I tell you it\\'s in the books?\\n\\xa0Do you want to go to doing different from what\\'s in the books, and get things all muddled up?\"\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don\\'t know how to do it to them?\\nthat\\'s the thing I want to get at.\\n\\xa0Now, what do you reckon it is?\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know.\\n\\xa0But per\\'aps if we keep them till they\\'re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they\\'re dead.\"\\n\"Now, that\\'s something _like_.\\n\\xa0That\\'ll answer.\\n\\xa0Why couldn\\'t you said that before?\\n\\xa0We\\'ll keep them till they\\'re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they\\'ll be, too eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.\"\\n\"How you talk, Ben Rogers.\\n\\xa0How can they get loose when there\\'s a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\"\\n\"A guard!\\n\\xa0Well, that _is_ good.\\n\\xa0So somebody\\'s got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.\\n\\xa0I think that\\'s foolishness.\\nWhy can\\'t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?\"\\n\"Because it ain\\'t in the books so that\\'s why.\\n\\xa0Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don\\'t you?\\nthat\\'s the idea.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t you reckon that the people that made the books knows what\\'s the correct thing to do?\\n\\xa0Do you reckon _you_ can learn \\'em anything?\\n\\xa0Not by a good deal.\\nNo, sir, we\\'ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.\"\\n\"All right.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t mind; but I say it\\'s a fool way, anyhow.\\n\\xa0Say, do we kill the women, too?\"\\n\"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn\\'t let on.\\n\\xa0Kill the women?\\n\\xa0No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.\\n\\xa0You fetch them to the cave, and you\\'re always as polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.\"\\n\"Well, if that\\'s the way I\\'m agreed, but I don\\'t take no stock in it.\\nMighty soon we\\'ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won\\'t be no place for the robbers.\\nBut go ahead, I ain\\'t got nothing to say.\"\\nLittle Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn\\'t want to be a robber any more.\\nSo they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.\\n\\xa0But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.\\nBen Rogers said he couldn\\'t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing.\\n\\xa0They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.\\nI clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking.\\nMy new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.\\nWELL, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes; but the widow she didn\\'t scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could.\\n\\xa0Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it.\\n\\xa0She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it.\\n\\xa0But it warn\\'t so.\\n\\xa0I tried it.\\nOnce I got a fish-line, but no hooks.\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t any good to me without hooks.\\n\\xa0I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn\\'t make it work.\\n\\xa0By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool.\\n\\xa0She never told me why, and I couldn\\'t make it out no way.\\nI set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.\\n\\xa0I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don\\'t Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?\\n\\xa0Why can\\'t the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole?\\n\\xa0Why can\\'t Miss Watson fat up?\\nNo, says I to my self, there ain\\'t nothing in it.\\n\\xa0I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was \"spiritual gifts.\"\\n\\xa0This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself.\\nThis was including Miss Watson, as I took it.\\n\\xa0I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn\\'t see no advantage about it except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn\\'t worry about it any more, but just let it go.\\n\\xa0Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body\\'s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again.\\n\\xa0I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow\\'s Providence, but if Miss Watson\\'s got him there warn\\'t no help for him any more.\\n\\xa0I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow\\'s if he wanted me, though I couldn\\'t make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.\\nPap he hadn\\'t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for me; I didn\\'t want to see him no more.\\n\\xa0He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around.\\n\\xa0Well, about this time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so people said.\\n\\xa0They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn\\'t make nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn\\'t much like a face at all.\\n\\xa0They said he was floating on his back in the water.\\n\\xa0They took him and buried him on the bank.\\n\\xa0But I warn\\'t comfortable long, because I happened to think of something.\\n\\xa0I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don\\'t float on his back, but on his face.\\n\\xa0So I knowed, then, that this warn\\'t pap, but a woman dressed up in a man\\'s clothes.\\n\\xa0So I was uncomfortable again.\\n\\xa0I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he wouldn\\'t.\\nWe played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.\\n\\xa0All the boys did.\\n\\xa0We hadn\\'t robbed nobody, hadn\\'t killed any people, but only just pretended.\\n\\xa0We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them.\\n\\xa0Tom Sawyer called the hogs \"ingots.\"\\nand he called the turnips and stuff \"julery.\"\\nand we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked.\\n\\xa0But I couldn\\'t see no profit in it.\\n\\xa0One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand \"sumte.\"\\nmules, all loaded down with di\\'monds, and they didn\\'t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.\\n\\xa0He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready.\\n\\xa0He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn\\'t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.\\n\\xa0But there warn\\'t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn\\'t no camels nor no elephants.\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that.\\n\\xa0We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t see no di\\'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.\\n\\xa0He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things.\\n\\xa0I said, why couldn\\'t we see them, then?\\n\\xa0He said if I warn\\'t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking.\\n\\xa0He said it was all done by enchantment.\\n\\xa0He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.\\n\\xa0I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians.\\n\\xa0Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.\\n\"Why.\"\\nsaid he, \"a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson.\\n\\xa0They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nI says, \"s\\'pose we got some genies to help _us_ can\\'t we lick the other crowd then?\"\\n\"How you going to get them?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\\n\\xa0How do _they_ get them?\"\\n\"Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling, and everything they\\'re told to do they up and do it.\\n\\xa0They don\\'t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it or any other man.\"\\n\"Who makes them tear around so?\"\\n\"Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.\\n\\xa0They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they\\'ve got to do whatever he says.\\n\\xa0If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di\\'monds, and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor\\'s daughter from China for you to marry, they\\'ve got to do it and they\\'ve got to do it before sun-up next morning, too.\\n\\xa0And more: \\xa0they\\'ve got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you understand.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nsays I, \"I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves \\'stead of fooling them away like that.\\n\\xa0And what\\'s more if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.\"\\n\"How you talk, Huck Finn.\\n\\xa0Why, you\\'d _have_ to come when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.\"\\n\"What!\\nand I as high as a tree and as big as a church?\\n\\xa0All right, then; I _would_ come; but I lay I\\'d make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country.\"\\n\"Shucks, it ain\\'t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.\\n\\xa0You don\\'t seem to know anything, somehow perfect saphead.\"\\nI thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it.\\n\\xa0I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn\\'t no use, none of the genies come.\\n\\xa0So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer\\'s lies.\\n\\xa0I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different.\\n\\xa0It had all the marks of a Sunday-school.\\nWELL, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now.\\nI had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don\\'t reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t take no stock in mathematics, anyway.\\nAt first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.\\nWhenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up.\\n\\xa0So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be.\\n\\xa0I was getting sort of used to the widow\\'s ways, too, and they warn\\'t so raspy on me.\\n\\xa0Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to me.\\n\\xa0I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit.\\nThe widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory.\\n\\xa0She said she warn\\'t ashamed of me.\\nOne morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.\\n\\xa0I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off.\\nShe says, \"Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making.\"\\n\\xa0The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn\\'t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.\\n\\xa0I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.\\n\\xa0There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn\\'t one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.\\nI went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence.\\n\\xa0There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody\\'s tracks.\\n\\xa0They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden fence.\\n\\xa0It was funny they hadn\\'t come in, after standing around so.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t make it out.\\n\\xa0It was very curious, somehow.\\n\\xa0I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t notice anything at first, but next I did.\\n\\xa0There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.\\nI was up in a second and shinning down the hill.\\n\\xa0I looked over my shoulder every now and then, but I didn\\'t see nobody.\\n\\xa0I was at Judge Thatcher\\'s as quick as I could get there.\\n\\xa0He said:  \"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.\\n\\xa0Did you come for your interest?\"\\n\"No, sir.\"\\nI says; \"is there some for me?\"\\n\"Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night over a hundred and fifty dollars.\\n\\xa0Quite a fortune for you.\\n\\xa0You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you\\'ll spend it.\"\\n\"No, sir.\"\\nI says, \"I don\\'t want to spend it.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t want it at all nor the six thousand, nuther.\\n\\xa0I want you to take it; I want to give it to you the six thousand and all.\"\\nHe looked surprised.\\n\\xa0He couldn\\'t seem to make it out.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"Why, what can you mean, my boy?\"\\nI says, \"Don\\'t you ask me no questions about it, please.\\n\\xa0You\\'ll take it won\\'t you?\"\\nHe says:  \"Well, I\\'m puzzled.\\n\\xa0Is something the matter?\"\\n\"Please take it.\"\\nsays I, \"and don\\'t ask me nothing then I won\\'t have to tell no lies.\"\\nHe studied a while, and then he says:  \"Oho-o!\\n\\xa0I think I see.\\n\\xa0You want to _sell_ all your property to me not give it.\\n\\xa0That\\'s the correct idea.\"\\nThen he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:  \"There; you see it says \\'for a consideration.\\' \\xa0That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it.\\n\\xa0Here\\'s a dollar for you.\\n\\xa0Now you sign it.\"\\nSo I signed it, and left.\\nMiss Watson\\'s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it.\\n\\xa0He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything.\\n\\xa0So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow.\\n\\xa0What I wanted to know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay?\\n\\xa0Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor.\\n\\xa0It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.\\n\\xa0Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.\\n\\xa0Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened.\\n\\xa0But it warn\\'t no use; he said it wouldn\\'t talk.\\nHe said sometimes it wouldn\\'t talk without money.\\n\\xa0I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn\\'t no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn\\'t pass nohow, even if the brass didn\\'t show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time.\\n\\xa0(I reckoned I wouldn\\'t say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn\\'t know the difference.\\n\\xa0Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good.\\n\\xa0He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn\\'t see no brass, and it wouldn\\'t feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball.\\n\\xa0Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.\\nJim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again.\\nThis time he said the hair-ball was all right.\\n\\xa0He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.\\n\\xa0I says, go on.\\n\\xa0So the hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"Yo\\' ole father doan\\' know yit what he\\'s a-gwyne to do.\\n\\xa0Sometimes he spec he\\'ll go \\'way, en den agin he spec he\\'ll stay.\\n\\xa0De bes\\' way is to res\\' easy en let de ole man take his own way.\\n\\xa0Dey\\'s two angels hoverin\\' roun\\' \\'bout him.\\n\\xa0One uv \\'em is white en shiny, en t\\'other one is black.\\nDe white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail in en bust it all up.\\n\\xa0A body can\\'t tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las\\'.\\n\\xa0But you is all right.\\n\\xa0You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo\\' life, en considable joy.\\n\\xa0Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you\\'s gwyne to git well agin.\\n\\xa0Dey\\'s two gals flyin\\' \\'bout you in yo\\' life.\\n\\xa0One uv \\'em\\'s light en t\\'other one is dark.\\nOne is rich en t\\'other is po\\'.\\n\\xa0You\\'s gwyne to marry de po\\' one fust en de rich one by en by.\\n\\xa0You wants to keep \\'way fum de water as much as you kin, en don\\'t run no resk, \\'kase it\\'s down in de bills dat you\\'s gwyne to git hung.\"\\nWhen I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap his own self!\\nI had shut the door to.\\n\\xa0Then I turned around and there he was.\\n\\xa0I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.\\n\\xa0I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn\\'t scared of him worth bothring about.\\nHe was most fifty, and he looked it.\\n\\xa0His hair was long and tangled and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines.\\n\\xa0It was all black, no gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t no color in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like another man\\'s white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body\\'s flesh crawl a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white.\\n\\xa0As for his clothes just rags, that was all.\\n\\xa0He had one ankle resting on t\\'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then.\\n\\xa0His hat was laying on the floor an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.\\nI stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair tilted back a little.\\n\\xa0I set the candle down.\\n\\xa0I noticed the window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed.\\n\\xa0He kept a-looking me all over.\\n\\xa0By and by he says:  \"Starchy clothes very.\\n\\xa0You think you\\'re a good deal of a big-bug, _don\\'t_ you?\"\\n\"Maybe I am, maybe I ain\\'t.\"\\nI says.\\n\"Don\\'t you give me none o\\' your lip.\"\\nsays he.\\n\\xa0\"You\\'ve put on considerable many frills since I been away.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll take you down a peg before I get done with you.\\n\\xa0You\\'re educated, too, they say can read and write.\\n\\xa0You think you\\'re better\\'n your father, now, don\\'t you, because he can\\'t?\\n\\xa0_I\\'ll_ take it out of you.\\n\\xa0Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut\\'n foolishness, hey?\\nwho told you you could?\"\\n\"The widow.\\n\\xa0She told me.\"\\n\"The widow, hey?\\nand who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ain\\'t none of her business?\"\\n\"Nobody never told her.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ll learn her how to meddle.\\n\\xa0And looky here you drop that school, you hear?\\n\\xa0I\\'ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better\\'n what _he_ is.\\n\\xa0You lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you hear?\\n\\xa0Your mother couldn\\'t read, and she couldn\\'t write, nuther, before she died.\\n\\xa0None of the family couldn\\'t before _they_ died.\\n\\xa0I can\\'t; and here you\\'re a-swelling yourself up like this.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t the man to stand it you hear?\\nSay, lemme hear you read.\"\\nI took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars.\\nWhen I\\'d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"It\\'s so.\\n\\xa0You can do it.\\n\\xa0I had my doubts when you told me.\\n\\xa0Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills.\\n\\xa0I won\\'t have it.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I\\'ll tan you good.\\nFirst you know you\\'ll get religion, too.\\n\\xa0I never see such a son.\"\\nHe took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and says:  \"What\\'s this?\"\\n\"It\\'s something they give me for learning my lessons good.\"\\nHe tore it up, and says:  \"I\\'ll give you something better I\\'ll give you a cowhide.\"\\nHe set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:  \"_Ain\\'t_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though?\\n\\xa0A bed; and bedclothes; and a look\\'n\\'-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard.\\n\\xa0I never see such a son.\\n\\xa0I bet I\\'ll take some o\\' these frills out o\\' you before I\\'m done with you.\\nWhy, there ain\\'t no end to your airs they say you\\'re rich.\\n\\xa0Hey?\\nhow\\'s that?\"\\n\"They lie that\\'s how.\"\\n\"Looky here mind how you talk to me; I\\'m a-standing about all I can stand now so don\\'t gimme no sass.\\n\\xa0I\\'ve been in town two days, and I hain\\'t heard nothing but about you bein\\' rich.\\n\\xa0I heard about it away down the river, too.\\n\\xa0That\\'s why I come.\\n\\xa0You git me that money to-morrow I want it.\"\\n\"I hain\\'t got no money.\"\\n\"It\\'s a lie.\\n\\xa0Judge Thatcher\\'s got it.\\n\\xa0You git it.\\n\\xa0I want it.\"\\n\"I hain\\'t got no money, I tell you.\\n\\xa0You ask Judge Thatcher; he\\'ll tell you the same.\"\\n\"All right.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll ask him; and I\\'ll make him pungle, too, or I\\'ll know the reason why.\\n\\xa0Say, how much you got in your pocket?\\n\\xa0I want it.\"\\n\"I hain\\'t got only a dollar, and I want that to.\"\\n\"It don\\'t make no difference what you want it for you just shell it out.\"\\nHe took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn\\'t had a drink all day.\\nWhen he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn\\'t drop that.\\nNext day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher\\'s and bullyragged him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn\\'t, and then he swore he\\'d make the law force him.\\nThe judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had just come, and he didn\\'t know the old man; so he said courts mustn\\'t interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he\\'d druther not take a child away from its father.\\n\\xa0So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business.\\nThat pleased the old man till he couldn\\'t rest.\\n\\xa0He said he\\'d cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn\\'t raise some money for him.\\n\\xa0I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed him again for a week.\\n\\xa0But he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he\\'d make it warm for _him_.\\nWhen he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.\\nSo he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak.\\n\\xa0And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he\\'d been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn\\'t be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him.\\n\\xa0The judge said he could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said he\\'d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it.\\n\\xa0The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried again.\\n\\xa0And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand, and says:  \"Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.\\nThere\\'s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain\\'t so no more; it\\'s the hand of a man that\\'s started in on a new life, and\\'ll die before he\\'ll go back.\\n\\xa0You mark them words don\\'t forget I said them.\\n\\xa0It\\'s a clean hand now; shake it don\\'t be afeard.\"\\nSo they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.\\n\\xa0The judge\\'s wife she kissed it.\\n\\xa0Then the old man he signed a pledge made his mark.\\nThe judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something like that.\\nThen they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.\\n\\xa0And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it.\\nThe judge he felt kind of sore.\\n\\xa0He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn\\'t know no other way.\\nWELL, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school.\\n\\xa0He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I\\'d go now to spite pap.\\n\\xa0That law trial was a slow business appeared like they warn\\'t ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I\\'d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.\\n\\xa0Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed.\\n\\xa0He was just suited this kind of thing was right in his line.\\nHe got to hanging around the widow\\'s too much and so she told him at last that if he didn\\'t quit using around there she would make trouble for him.\\nWell, _wasn\\'t_ he mad?\\n\\xa0He said he would show who was Huck Finn\\'s boss.\\n\\xa0So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn\\'t no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn\\'t find it if you didn\\'t know where it was.\\nHe kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.\\nWe lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights.\\n\\xa0He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.\\n\\xa0Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me.\\n\\xa0The widow she found out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn\\'t long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it all but the cowhide part.\\nIt was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor study.\\n\\xa0Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn\\'t see how I\\'d ever got to like it so well at the widow\\'s, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t want to go back no more.\\n\\xa0I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn\\'t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn\\'t no objections.\\n\\xa0It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it all around.\\nBut by and by pap got too handy with his hick\\'ry, and I couldn\\'t stand it.\\nI was all over welts.\\n\\xa0He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in.\\n\\xa0Once he locked me in and was gone three days.\\n\\xa0It was dreadful lonesome.\\n\\xa0I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn\\'t ever going to get out any more.\\n\\xa0I was scared.\\n\\xa0I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there.\\n\\xa0I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn\\'t find no way.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t a window to it big enough for a dog to get through.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow.\\n\\xa0The door was thick, solid oak slabs.\\n\\xa0Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time.\\n\\xa0But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof.\\nI greased it up and went to work.\\n\\xa0There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out.\\n\\xa0I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out big enough to let me through.\\n\\xa0Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap\\'s gun in the woods.\\n\\xa0I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.\\nPap warn\\'t in a good humor so he was his natural self.\\n\\xa0He said he was down town, and everything was going wrong.\\n\\xa0His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it.\\nAnd he said people allowed there\\'d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time.\\n\\xa0This shook me up considerable, because I didn\\'t want to go back to the widow\\'s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.\\n\\xa0Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn\\'t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn\\'t know the names of, and so called them what\\'s-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.\\nHe said he would like to see the widow get me.\\n\\xa0He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn\\'t find me.\\n\\xa0That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn\\'t stay on hand till he got that chance.\\nThe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got.\\nThere was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow.\\n\\xa0I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.\\n\\xa0I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away.\\n\\xa0I guessed I wouldn\\'t stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn\\'t ever find me any more.\\n\\xa0I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.\\n\\xa0I got so full of it I didn\\'t notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\\nI got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.\\n\\xa0While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again.\\n\\xa0He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.\\n\\xa0A body would a thought he was Adam he was just all mud.\\n\\xa0Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:  \"Call this a govment!\\nwhy, just look at it and see what it\\'s like.\\nHere\\'s the law a-standing ready to take a man\\'s son away from him a man\\'s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising.\\n\\xa0Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin\\' for _him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him.\\n\\xa0And they call _that_ govment!\\n\\xa0That ain\\'t all, nuther.\\n\\xa0The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o\\' my property.\\n\\xa0Here\\'s what the law does: \\xa0The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up\\'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain\\'t fitten for a hog.\\nThey call that govment!\\n\\xa0A man can\\'t get his rights in a govment like this.\\nSometimes I\\'ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all.\\nYes, and I _told_ \\'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face.\\n\\xa0Lots of \\'em heard me, and can tell what I said.\\n\\xa0Says I, for two cents I\\'d leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin.\\n\\xa0Them\\'s the very words.\\n\\xa0I says look at my hat if you call it a hat but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it\\'s below my chin, and then it ain\\'t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o\\' stove-pipe.\\n\\xa0Look at it, says I such a hat for me to wear one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.\\n\"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.\\n\\xa0Why, looky here.\\nThere was a free nigger there from Ohio a mulatter, most as white as a white man.\\n\\xa0He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain\\'t a man in that town that\\'s got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.\\n\\xa0And what do you think?\\n\\xa0They said he was a p\\'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.\\n\\xa0And that ain\\'t the wust.\\nThey said he could _vote_ when he was at home.\\n\\xa0Well, that let me out.\\nThinks I, what is the country a-coming to?\\n\\xa0It was \\'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn\\'t too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they\\'d let that nigger vote, I drawed out.\\n\\xa0I says I\\'ll never vote agin.\\n\\xa0Them\\'s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me I\\'ll never vote agin as long as I live.\\n\\xa0And to see the cool way of that nigger why, he wouldn\\'t a give me the road if I hadn\\'t shoved him out o\\' the way.\\n\\xa0I says to the people, why ain\\'t this nigger put up at auction and sold?\\nthat\\'s what I want to know.\\n\\xa0And what do you reckon they said?\\nWhy, they said he couldn\\'t be sold till he\\'d been in the State six months, and he hadn\\'t been there that long yet.\\n\\xa0There, now that\\'s a specimen.\\n\\xa0They call that a govment that can\\'t sell a free nigger till he\\'s been in the State six months.\\n\\xa0Here\\'s a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet\\'s got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger, and.\"\\nPap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there.\\n\\xa0He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.\\n\\xa0But it warn\\'t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body\\'s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous.\\n\\xa0He said so his own self afterwards.\\n\\xa0He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.\\nAfter supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens.\\n\\xa0That was always his word.\\n\\xa0I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t\\'other.\\n\\xa0He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn\\'t run my way.\\n\\xa0He didn\\'t go sound asleep, but was uneasy.\\n\\xa0He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time.\\n\\xa0At last I got so sleepy I couldn\\'t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.\\nI don\\'t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up.\\n\\xa0There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes.\\n\\xa0He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek but I couldn\\'t see no snakes.\\n\\xa0He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering \"Take him off!\\ntake him off!\\nhe\\'s biting me on the neck.\"\\n\\xa0I never see a man look so wild in the eyes.\\nPretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him.\\n\\xa0He wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning.\\n\\xa0Then he laid stiller, and didn\\'t make a sound.\\n\\xa0I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still.\\n\\xa0He was laying over by the corner.\\nBy and by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side.\\n\\xa0He says, very low:  \"Tramp tramp tramp; that\\'s the dead; tramp tramp tramp; they\\'re coming after me; but I won\\'t go.\\n\\xa0Oh, they\\'re here!\\ndon\\'t touch me don\\'t!\\nhands off they\\'re cold; let go.\\n\\xa0Oh, let a poor devil alone.\"\\nThen he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.\\n\\xa0I could hear him through the blanket.\\nBy and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see me and went for me.\\n\\xa0He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn\\'t come for him no more.\\n\\xa0I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up.\\n\\xa0Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself.\\nPretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me.\\nHe put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.\\nSo he dozed off pretty soon.\\n\\xa0By and by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the gun.\\n\\xa0I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him to stir.\\n\\xa0And how slow and still the time did drag along.\\n\"GIT up!\\n\\xa0What you \\'bout?\"\\nI opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was.\\n\\xa0It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.\\n\\xa0Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick, too.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"What you doin\\' with this gun?\"\\nI judged he didn\\'t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:  \"Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.\"\\n\"Why didn\\'t you roust me out?\"\\n\"Well, I tried to, but I couldn\\'t; I couldn\\'t budge you.\"\\n\"Well, all right.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there\\'s a fish on the lines for breakfast.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll be along in a minute.\"\\nHe unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.\\n\\xa0I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.\\n\\xa0I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town.\\n\\xa0The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill.\\nI went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t\\'other one out for what the rise might fetch along.\\n\\xa0Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck.\\n\\xa0I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.\\n\\xa0I just expected there\\'d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they\\'d raise up and laugh at him.\\n\\xa0But it warn\\'t so this time.\\n\\xa0It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.\\n\\xa0Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this she\\'s worth ten dollars.\\n\\xa0But when I got to shore pap wasn\\'t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: \\xa0I judged I\\'d hide her good, and then, \\'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I\\'d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.\\nIt was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun.\\n\\xa0So he hadn\\'t seen anything.\\nWhen he got along I was hard at it taking up a \"tro.\"\\nline.\\n\\xa0He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me so long.\\n\\xa0I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions.\\n\\xa0We got five catfish off the lines and went home.\\nWhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen.\\n\\xa0Well, I didn\\'t see no way for a while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he says:  \"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you hear?\\nThat man warn\\'t here for no good.\\n\\xa0I\\'d a shot him.\\n\\xa0Next time you roust me out, you hear?\"\\nThen he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted.\\n\\xa0I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won\\'t think of following me.\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock we turned out and went along up the bank.\\n\\xa0The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the rise.\\nBy and by along comes part of a log raft nine logs fast together.\\n\\xa0We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.\\n\\xa0Then we had dinner.\\nAnybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn\\'t pap\\'s style.\\n\\xa0Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell.\\n\\xa0So he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.\\n\\xa0I judged he wouldn\\'t come back that night.\\n\\xa0I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again.\\n\\xa0Before he was t\\'other side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.\\nI took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.\\n\\xa0I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.\\n\\xa0I took fish-lines and matches and other things everything that was worth a cent.\\n\\xa0I cleaned out the place.\\n\\xa0I wanted an axe, but there wasn\\'t any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.\\n\\xa0I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.\\nI had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things.\\n\\xa0So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust.\\n\\xa0Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn\\'t quite touch ground.\\n\\xa0If you stood four or five foot away and didn\\'t know it was sawed, you wouldn\\'t never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn\\'t likely anybody would go fooling around there.\\nIt was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn\\'t left a track.\\n\\xa0I followed around to see.\\n\\xa0I stood on the bank and looked out over the river.\\n\\xa0All safe.\\n\\xa0So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms.\\nI shot this fellow and took him into camp.\\nI took the axe and smashed in the door.\\n\\xa0I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it.\\n\\xa0I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground hard packed, and no boards.\\n\\xa0Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it all I could drag and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight.\\n\\xa0You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground.\\n\\xa0I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy touches.\\n\\xa0Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.\\nWell, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.\\n\\xa0Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\\'t drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river.\\n\\xa0Now I thought of something else.\\n\\xa0So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\\n\\xa0I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn\\'t no knives and forks on the place pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.\\n\\xa0Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes and ducks too, you might say, in the season.\\n\\xa0There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don\\'t know where, but it didn\\'t go to the river.\\n\\xa0The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.\\n\\xa0I dropped pap\\'s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident.\\nThen I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn\\'t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\\nIt was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.\\n\\xa0I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.\\n\\xa0I says to myself, they\\'ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me.\\n\\xa0And they\\'ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things.\\n\\xa0They won\\'t ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass.\\nThey\\'ll soon get tired of that, and won\\'t bother no more about me.\\n\\xa0All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\\nJackson\\'s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there.\\n\\xa0And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want.\\nJackson\\'s Island\\'s the place.\\nI was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.\\n\\xa0When I woke up I didn\\'t know where I was for a minute.\\n\\xa0I set up and looked around, a little scared.\\n\\xa0Then I remembered.\\n\\xa0The river looked miles and miles across.\\n\\xa0The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore.\\nEverything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\\nYou know what I mean I don\\'t know the words to put it in.\\nI took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water.\\n\\xa0I listened.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon I made it out.\\n\\xa0It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it\\'s a still night.\\n\\xa0I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was a skiff, away across the water.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t tell how many was in it.\\n\\xa0It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn\\'t but one man in it.\\n\\xa0Think\\'s I, maybe it\\'s pap, though I warn\\'t expecting him.\\n\\xa0He dropped below me with the current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\\n\\xa0Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.\\nI didn\\'t lose no time.\\n\\xa0The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank.\\n\\xa0I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me.\\n\\xa0I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\\n\\xa0I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it.\\n\\xa0The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\\n\\xa0And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!\\n\\xa0I heard people talking at the ferry landing.\\nI heard what they said, too every word of it.\\n\\xa0One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now.\\n\\xa0T\\'other one said _this_ warn\\'t one of the short ones, he reckoned and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn\\'t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone.\\n\\xa0The first fellow said he \\'lowed to tell it to his old woman she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn\\'t nothing to some things he had said in his time.\\nI heard one man say it was nearly three o\\'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn\\'t wait more than about a week longer.\\n\\xa0After that the talk got further and further away, and I couldn\\'t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\\nI was away below the ferry now.\\n\\xa0I rose up, and there was Jackson\\'s Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t any signs of the bar at the head it was all under water now.\\nIt didn\\'t take me long to get there.\\n\\xa0I shot past the head at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.\\n\\xa0I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside.\\nI went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.\\n\\xa0A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it.\\n\\xa0I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \"Stern oars, there!\\nheave her head to stabboard.\"\\n\\xa0I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side.\\nThere was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and laid down for a nap before breakfast.\\nTHE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o\\'clock.\\n\\xa0I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.\\n\\xa0I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.\\n\\xa0There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there.\\n\\xa0A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly.\\nI was powerful lazy and comfortable didn\\'t want to get up and cook breakfast.\\n\\xa0Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of \"boom.\"\\naway up the river.\\n\\xa0I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.\\n\\xa0I hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up about abreast the ferry.\\n\\xa0And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down.\\n\\xa0I knowed what was the matter now.\\n\\xa0\"Boom.\"\\nI see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat\\'s side.\\n\\xa0You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.\\nI was pretty hungry, but it warn\\'t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke.\\n\\xa0So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.\\n\\xa0The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat.\\nWell, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there.\\n\\xa0So, says I, I\\'ll keep a lookout, and if any of them\\'s floating around after me I\\'ll give them a show.\\n\\xa0I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn\\'t disappointed.\\n\\xa0A big double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further.\\n\\xa0Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore I knowed enough for that.\\n\\xa0But by and by along comes another one, and this time I won.\\n\\xa0I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.\\n\\xa0It was \"baker\\'s brea.\"\\nwhat the quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\\nI got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.\\n\\xa0And then something struck me.\\n\\xa0I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone and done it.\\n\\xa0So there ain\\'t no doubt but there is something in that thing that is, there\\'s something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don\\'t work for me, and I reckon it don\\'t work for only just the right kind.\\nI lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.\\n\\xa0The ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I\\'d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did.\\n\\xa0When she\\'d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.\\n\\xa0Where the log forked I could peep through.\\nBy and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore.\\n\\xa0Most everybody was on the boat.\\n\\xa0Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\\n\\xa0Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:  \"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he\\'s washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water\\'s edge.\\n\\xa0I hope so, anyway.\"\\nI didn\\'t hope so.\\n\\xa0They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.\\n\\xa0I could see them first-rate, but they couldn\\'t see me.\\n\\xa0Then the captain sung out:  \"Stand away.\"\\nand the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone.\\n\\xa0If they\\'d a had some bullets in, I reckon they\\'d a got the corpse they was after.\\n\\xa0Well, I see I warn\\'t hurt, thanks to goodness.\\nThe boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island.\\n\\xa0I could hear the booming now and then, further and further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn\\'t hear it no more.\\n\\xa0The island was three mile long.\\n\\xa0I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up.\\n\\xa0But they didn\\'t yet a while.\\n\\xa0They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.\\n\\xa0I crossed over to that side and watched them.\\nWhen they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town.\\nI knowed I was all right now.\\n\\xa0Nobody else would come a-hunting after me.\\nI got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods.\\n\\xa0I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn\\'t get at them.\\n\\xa0I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper.\\n\\xa0Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\\nWhen it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain\\'t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can\\'t stay so, you soon get over it.\\nAnd so for three days and nights.\\n\\xa0No difference just the same thing.\\nBut the next day I went exploring around down through the island.\\n\\xa0I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.\\n\\xa0I found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.\\n\\xa0They would all come handy by and by, I judged.\\nWell, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn\\'t far from the foot of the island.\\n\\xa0I had my gun along, but I hadn\\'t shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home.\\nAbout this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it.\\nI clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\\nMy heart jumped up amongst my lungs.\\n\\xa0I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could.\\n\\xa0Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn\\'t hear nothing else.\\n\\xa0I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on.\\n\\xa0If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\\nWhen I got to camp I warn\\'t feeling very brash, there warn\\'t much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain\\'t no time to be fooling around.\\n\\xa0So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year\\'s camp, and then clumb a tree.\\nI reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn\\'t see nothing, I didn\\'t hear nothing I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a thousand things.\\n\\xa0Well, I couldn\\'t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time.\\nAll I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.\\nBy the time it was night I was pretty hungry.\\n\\xa0So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank about a quarter of a mile.\\n\\xa0I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people\\'s voices.\\n\\xa0I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out.\\n\\xa0I hadn\\'t got far when I hear a man say:  \"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out.\\n\\xa0Let\\'s look around.\"\\nI didn\\'t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.\\n\\xa0I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\\nI didn\\'t sleep much.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t, somehow, for thinking.\\n\\xa0And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.\\n\\xa0So the sleep didn\\'t do me no good.\\n\\xa0By and by I says to myself, I can\\'t live this way; I\\'m a-going to find out who it is that\\'s here on the island with me; I\\'ll find it out or bust.\\n\\xa0Well, I felt better right off.\\nSo I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.\\n\\xa0The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\\n\\xa0I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep.\\nWell, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.\\n\\xa0A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done.\\n\\xa0I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods.\\n\\xa0I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves.\\n\\xa0I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river.\\nBut in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming.\\n\\xa0So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen.\\n\\xa0But I hadn\\'t no luck somehow; I couldn\\'t seem to find the place.\\n\\xa0But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees.\\n\\xa0I went for it, cautious and slow.\\n\\xa0By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.\\n\\xa0It most give me the fan-tods.\\nHe had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire.\\n\\xa0I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.\\n\\xa0It was getting gray daylight now.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson\\'s Jim!\\n\\xa0I bet I was glad to see him.\\n\\xa0I says:  \"Hello, Jim.\"\\nand skipped out.\\nHe bounced up and stared at me wild.\\n\\xa0Then he drops down on his knees, and puts his hands together and says:  \"Doan\\' hurt me don\\'t!\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t ever done no harm to a ghos\\'.\\n\\xa0I alwuz liked dead people, en done all I could for \\'em.\\n\\xa0You go en git in de river agin, whah you b\\'longs, en doan\\' do nuffn to Ole Jim, \\'at \\'uz awluz yo\\' fren\\'.\"\\nWell, I warn\\'t long making him understand I warn\\'t dead.\\n\\xa0I was ever so glad to see Jim.\\n\\xa0I warn\\'t lonesome now.\\n\\xa0I told him I warn\\'t afraid of _him_ telling the people where I was.\\n\\xa0I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing.\\n\\xa0Then I says:  \"It\\'s good daylight.\\n\\xa0Le\\'s get breakfast.\\n\\xa0Make up your camp fire good.\"\\n\"What\\'s de use er makin\\' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck?\\nBut you got a gun, hain\\'t you?\\n\\xa0Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.\"\\n\"Strawberries and such truck.\"\\nI says.\\n\\xa0\"Is that what you live on?\"\\n\"I couldn\\' git nuffn else.\"\\nhe says.\\n\"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?\"\\n\"I come heah de night arter you\\'s killed.\"\\n\"What, all that time?\"\\n\"Yes indeedy.\"\\n\"And ain\\'t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?\"\\n\"No, sah nuffn else.\"\\n\"Well, you must be most starved, ain\\'t you?\"\\n\"I reck\\'n I could eat a hoss.\\n\\xa0I think I could.\\nHow long you ben on de islan\\'?\"\\n\"Since the night I got killed.\"\\n\"No!\\n\\xa0W\\'y, what has you lived on?\\n\\xa0But you got a gun.\\n\\xa0Oh, yes, you got a gun.\\n\\xa0Dat\\'s good.\\n\\xa0Now you kill sumfn en I\\'ll make up de fire.\"\\nSo we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft.\\nI catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.\\nWhen breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\\nJim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.\\n\\xa0Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.\\n\\xa0By and by Jim says:  \"But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat \\'uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn\\'t you?\"\\nThen I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.\\n\\xa0He said Tom Sawyer couldn\\'t get up no better plan than what I had.\\n\\xa0Then I says:  \"How do you come to be here, Jim, and how\\'d you get here?\"\\nHe looked pretty uneasy, and didn\\'t say nothing for a minute.\\n\\xa0Then he says:  \"Maybe I better not tell.\"\\n\"Why, Jim?\"\\n\"Well, dey\\'s reasons.\\n\\xa0But you wouldn\\' tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?\"\\n\"Blamed if I would, Jim.\"\\n\"Well, I b\\'lieve you, Huck.\\n\\xa0I _I run off_.\"\\n\"Jim.\"\\n\"But mind, you said you wouldn\\' tell you know you said you wouldn\\' tell, Huck.\"\\n\"Well, I did.\\n\\xa0I said I wouldn\\'t, and I\\'ll stick to it.\\n\\xa0Honest _injun_, I will.\\n\\xa0People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum but that don\\'t make no difference.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t a-going to tell, and I ain\\'t a-going back there, anyways.\\n\\xa0So, now, le\\'s know all about it.\"\\n\"Well, you see, it \\'uz dis way.\\n\\xa0Ole missus dat\\'s Miss Watson she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn\\' sell me down to Orleans.\\n\\xa0But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun\\' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy.\\n\\xa0Well, one night I creeps to de do\\' pooty late, en de do\\' warn\\'t quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn\\' want to, but she could git eight hund\\'d dollars for me, en it \\'uz sich a big stack o\\' money she couldn\\' resis\\'.\\n\\xa0De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn\\' do it, but I never waited to hear de res\\'.\\n\\xa0I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.\\n\"I tuck out en shin down de hill, en \\'spec to steal a skift \\'long de sho\\' som\\'ers \\'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go \\'way.\\nWell, I wuz dah all night.\\n\\xa0Dey wuz somebody roun\\' all de time.\\n\\xa0\\'Long \\'bout six in de mawnin\\' skifts begin to go by, en \\'bout eight er nine every skift dat went \\'long wuz talkin\\' \\'bout how yo\\' pap come over to de town en say you\\'s killed.\\n\\xa0Dese las\\' skifts wuz full o\\' ladies en genlmen a-goin\\' over for to see de place.\\n\\xa0Sometimes dey\\'d pull up at de sho\\' en take a res\\' b\\'fo\\' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all \\'bout de killin\\'.\\n\\xa0I \\'uz powerful sorry you\\'s killed, Huck, but I ain\\'t no mo\\' now.\\n\"I laid dah under de shavin\\'s all day.\\n\\xa0I \\'uz hungry, but I warn\\'t afeard;

but I didn\\'t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn\\'t sting me.\\nI had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.\\n\\xa0Jim knowed all kinds of signs.\\n\\xa0He said he knowed most everything.\\n\\xa0I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn\\'t any good-luck signs.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"Mighty few an\\' _dey_ ain\\'t no use to a body.\\n\\xa0What you want to know when good luck\\'s a-comin\\' for?\\n\\xa0Want to keep it off?\"\\n\\xa0And he said: \\xa0\"Ef you\\'s got hairy arms en a hairy breas\\', it\\'s a sign dat you\\'s agwyne to be rich.\\nWell, dey\\'s some use in a sign like dat, \\'kase it\\'s so fur ahead.\\nYou see, maybe you\\'s got to be po\\' a long time fust, en so you might git discourage\\' en kill yo\\'sef \\'f you didn\\' know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.\"\\n\"Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?\"\\n\"What\\'s de use to ax dat question?\\n\\xa0Don\\'t you see I has?\"\\n\"Well, are you rich?\"\\n\"No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.\\n\\xa0Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat\\'n\\', en got busted out.\"\\n\"What did you speculate in, Jim?\"\\n\"Well, fust I tackled stock.\"\\n\"What kind of stock?\"\\n\"Why, live stock cattle, you know.\\n\\xa0I put ten dollars in a cow.\\n\\xa0But I ain\\' gwyne to resk no mo\\' money in stock.\\n\\xa0De cow up \\'n\\' died on my han\\'s.\"\\n\"So you lost the ten dollars.\"\\n\"No, I didn\\'t lose it all.\\n\\xa0I on\\'y los\\' \\'bout nine of it.\\n\\xa0I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.\"\\n\"You had five dollars and ten cents left.\\n\\xa0Did you speculate any more?\"\\n\"Yes.\\n\\xa0You know that one-laigged nigger dat b\\'longs to old Misto Bradish?\\nWell, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo\\' dollars mo\\' at de en\\' er de year.\\n\\xa0Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn\\'t have much.\\n\\xa0I wuz de on\\'y one dat had much.\\n\\xa0So I stuck out for mo\\' dan fo\\' dollars, en I said \\'f I didn\\' git it I\\'d start a bank mysef.\\nWell, o\\' course dat nigger want\\' to keep me out er de business, bekase he says dey warn\\'t business \\'nough for two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en\\' er de year.\\n\"So I done it.\\n\\xa0Den I reck\\'n\\'d I\\'d inves\\' de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin\\'.\\n\\xa0Dey wuz a nigger name\\' Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn\\' know it; en I bought it off\\'n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en\\' er de year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank\\'s busted.\\n\\xa0So dey didn\\' none uv us git no money.\"\\n\"What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?\"\\n\"Well, I \\'uz gwyne to spen\\' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name\\' Balum Balum\\'s Ass dey call him for short;

en I\\'s rich now, come to look at it.\\n\\xa0I owns mysef, en I\\'s wuth eight hund\\'d dollars.\\n\\xa0I wisht I had de money, I wouldn\\' want no mo\\'.\"\\nI wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that I\\'d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.\\nThis place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high.\\nWe had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick.\\n\\xa0We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois.\\n\\xa0The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.\\n\\xa0It was cool in there.\\nJim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn\\'t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\\nJim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs.\\n\\xa0And, besides, he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?\\nSo we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there.\\n\\xa0Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.\\n\\xa0We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\\nThe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good place to build a fire on.\\n\\xa0So we built it there and cooked dinner.\\nWe spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\\nWe put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it.\\n\\xa0Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so.\\n\\xa0It was one of these regular summer storms.\\n\\xa0It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest _FST_!\\nit was as bright as glory, and you\\'d have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you\\'d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs where it\\'s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.\\n\"Jim, this is nice.\"\\nI says.\\n\\xa0\"I wouldn\\'t want to be nowhere else but here.\\nPass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.\"\\n\"Well, you wouldn\\'t a ben here \\'f it hadn\\'t a ben for Jim.\\n\\xa0You\\'d a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn\\' mos\\' drownded, too; dat you would, honey.\\n\\xa0Chickens knows when it\\'s gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile.\"\\nThe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last it was over the banks.\\n\\xa0The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.\\n\\xa0On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across a half a mile because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs.\\nDaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.\\n\\xa0We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way.\\n\\xa0Well, on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles they would slide off in the water.\\n\\xa0The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\\nWe could a had pets enough if we\\'d wanted them.\\nOne night we catched a little section of a lumber raft nice pine planks.\\nIt was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches a solid, level floor.\\n\\xa0We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go; we didn\\'t show ourselves in daylight.\\nAnother night when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.\\n\\xa0She was a two-story, and tilted over considerable.\\n\\xa0We paddled out and got aboard clumb in at an upstairs window.\\n\\xa0But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\\nThe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.\\n\\xa0Then we looked in at the window.\\n\\xa0We could make out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there was clothes hanging against the wall.\\n\\xa0There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man.\\n\\xa0So Jim says:  \"Hello, you.\"\\nBut it didn\\'t budge.\\n\\xa0So I hollered again, and then Jim says:  \"De man ain\\'t asleep he\\'s dead.\\n\\xa0You hold still I\\'ll go en see.\"\\nHe went, and bent down and looked, and says:  \"It\\'s a dead man.\\n\\xa0Yes, indeedy; naked, too.\\n\\xa0He\\'s ben shot in de back.\\nI reck\\'n he\\'s ben dead two er three days.\\n\\xa0Come in, Huck, but doan\\' look at his face it\\'s too gashly.\"\\nI didn\\'t look at him at all.\\n\\xa0Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he needn\\'t done it; I didn\\'t want to see him.\\n\\xa0There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\\n\\xa0There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women\\'s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men\\'s clothing, too.\\n\\xa0We put the lot into the canoe it might come good.\\n\\xa0There was a boy\\'s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.\\n\\xa0And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck.\\n\\xa0We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.\\n\\xa0There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.\\n\\xa0They stood open, but there warn\\'t nothing left in them that was any account.\\n\\xa0The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn\\'t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\\nWe got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn\\'t have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.\\n\\xa0The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn\\'t find the other one, though we hunted all around.\\nAnd so, take it all around, we made a good haul.\\n\\xa0When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off.\\n\\xa0I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it.\\n\\xa0I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn\\'t no accidents and didn\\'t see nobody.\\n\\xa0We got home all safe.\\nAFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed, but Jim didn\\'t want to.\\n\\xa0He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha\\'nt us; he said a man that warn\\'t buried was more likely to go a-ha\\'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable.\\n\\xa0That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn\\'t say no more; but I couldn\\'t keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.\\nWe rummaged the clothes we\\'d got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.\\n\\xa0Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they\\'d a knowed the money was there they wouldn\\'t a left it.\\n\\xa0I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn\\'t want to talk about that.\\n\\xa0I says:  \"Now you think it\\'s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday?\\nYou said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands.\\n\\xa0Well, here\\'s your bad luck!\\n\\xa0We\\'ve raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides.\\n\\xa0I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.\"\\n\"Never you mind, honey, never you mind.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t you git too peart.\\n\\xa0It\\'s a-comin\\'.\\n\\xa0Mind I tell you, it\\'s a-comin\\'.\"\\nIt did come, too.\\n\\xa0It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.\\n\\xa0Well, after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco.\\n\\xa0I went to the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there.\\n\\xa0I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim\\'s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there\\'d be some fun when Jim found him there.\\n\\xa0Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake\\'s mate was there, and bit him.\\nHe jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring.\\n\\xa0I laid him out in a second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap\\'s whisky-jug and begun to pour it down.\\nHe was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.\\n\\xa0That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.\\n\\xa0Jim told me to chop off the snake\\'s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it.\\n\\xa0I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him.\\nHe made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too.\\n\\xa0He said that that would help.\\n\\xa0Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn\\'t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.\\nJim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again.\\n\\xa0His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I\\'d druther been bit with a snake than pap\\'s whisky.\\nJim was laid up for four days and nights.\\n\\xa0Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again.\\n\\xa0I made up my mind I wouldn\\'t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it.\\nJim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.\\n\\xa0And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn\\'t got to the end of it yet.\\n\\xa0He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand.\\n\\xa0Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I\\'ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.\\n\\xa0Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn\\'t see it.\\n\\xa0Pap told me.\\n\\xa0But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.\\nWell, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds.\\nWe couldn\\'t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois.\\n\\xa0We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded.\\n\\xa0We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage.\\n\\xa0We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it.\\n\\xa0Jim said he\\'d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it.\\n\\xa0It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.\\n\\xa0Jim said he hadn\\'t ever seen a bigger one.\\n\\xa0He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.\\n\\xa0They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat\\'s as white as snow and makes a good fry.\\nNext morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up some way.\\n\\xa0I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on.\\n\\xa0Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp.\\n\\xa0Then he studied it over and said, couldn\\'t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\\n\\xa0That was a good notion, too.\\n\\xa0So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.\\n\\xa0Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.\\n\\xa0I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.\\n\\xa0Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.\\n\\xa0I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn\\'t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.\\n\\xa0I took notice, and done better.\\nI started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.\\nI started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.\\n\\xa0I tied up and started along the bank.\\n\\xa0There was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn\\'t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there.\\n\\xa0I slipped up and peeped in at the window.\\n\\xa0There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn\\'t start a face in that town that I didn\\'t know.\\n\\xa0Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out.\\n\\xa0But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn\\'t forget I was a girl.\\n\"COME in.\"\\nsays the woman, and I did.\\n\\xa0She says: \\xa0\"Take a cheer.\"\\nI done it.\\n\\xa0She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:  \"What might your name be?\"\\n\"Sarah Williams.\"\\n\"Where \\'bouts do you live?\\n\\xa0In this neighborhood?\\'\\n\"No\\'m.\\n\\xa0In Hookerville, seven mile below.\\n\\xa0I\\'ve walked all the way and I\\'m all tired out.\"\\n\"Hungry, too, I reckon.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll find you something.\"\\n\"No\\'m, I ain\\'t hungry.\\n\\xa0I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain\\'t hungry no more.\\n\\xa0It\\'s what makes me so late.\\nMy mother\\'s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore.\\n\\xa0He lives at the upper end of the town, she says.\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t ever been here before.\\n\\xa0Do you know him?\"\\n\"No; but I don\\'t know everybody yet.\\n\\xa0I haven\\'t lived here quite two weeks.\\nIt\\'s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town.\\n\\xa0You better stay here all night.\\n\\xa0Take off your bonnet.\"\\n\"No.\"\\nI says; \"I\\'ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t afeared of the dark.\"\\nShe said she wouldn\\'t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she\\'d send him along with me.\\nThen she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better off they used to was, and how they didn\\'t know but they\\'d made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.\\n\\xa0She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered.\\n\\xa0I says:  \"Who done it?\\n\\xa0We\\'ve heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville, but we don\\'t know who \\'twas that killed Huck Finn.\"\\n\"Well, I reckon there\\'s a right smart chance of people _here_ that\\'d like to know who killed him.\\n\\xa0Some think old Finn done it himself.\"\\n\"No is that so?\"\\n\"Most everybody thought it at first.\\n\\xa0He\\'ll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched.\\n\\xa0But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.\"\\n\"Why _he_.\"\\nI stopped.\\n\\xa0I reckoned I better keep still.\\n\\xa0She run on, and never noticed I had put in at all:  \"The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.\\n\\xa0So there\\'s a reward out for him three hundred dollars.\\n\\xa0And there\\'s a reward out for old Finn, too two hundred dollars.\\n\\xa0You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with \\'em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.\\n\\xa0Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.\\n\\xa0Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn\\'t ben seen sence ten o\\'clock the night the murder was done.\\n\\xa0So then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with.\\nThe judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.\\n\\xa0Well, he hain\\'t come back sence, and they ain\\'t looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he\\'d get Huck\\'s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.\\n\\xa0People do say he warn\\'t any too good to do it.\\n\\xa0Oh, he\\'s sly, I reckon.\\n\\xa0If he don\\'t come back for a year he\\'ll be all right.\\n\\xa0You can\\'t prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he\\'ll walk in Huck\\'s money as easy as nothing.\"\\n\"Yes, I reckon so, \\'m.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t see nothing in the way of it.\\n\\xa0Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?\"\\n\"Oh, no, not everybody.\\n\\xa0A good many thinks he done it.\\n\\xa0But they\\'ll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.\"\\n\"Why, are they after him yet?\"\\n\"Well, you\\'re innocent, ain\\'t you!\\n\\xa0Does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up?\\n\\xa0Some folks think the nigger ain\\'t far from here.\\n\\xa0I\\'m one of them but I hain\\'t talked it around.\\n\\xa0A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson\\'s Island.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t anybody live there?\\nsays I.\\nNo, nobody, says they.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t say any more, but I done some thinking.\\n\\xa0I was pretty near certain I\\'d seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that nigger\\'s hiding over there; anyway, says I, it\\'s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he\\'s gone, if it was him; but husband\\'s going over to see him and another man.\\n\\xa0He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.\"\\nI had got so uneasy I couldn\\'t set still.\\n\\xa0I had to do something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it.\\nMy hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it.\\n\\xa0When the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little.\\n\\xa0I put down the needle and thread, and let on to be interested and I was, too and says:  \"Three hundred dollars is a power of money.\\n\\xa0I wish my mother could get it.\\nIs your husband going over there to-night?\"\\n\"Oh, yes.\\n\\xa0He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun.\\n\\xa0They\\'ll go over after midnight.\"\\n\"Couldn\\'t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?\"\\n\"Yes.\\n\\xa0And couldn\\'t the nigger see better, too?\\n\\xa0After midnight he\\'ll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he\\'s got one.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t think of that.\"\\nThe woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn\\'t feel a bit comfortable.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon she says,  \"What did you say your name was, honey?\"\\n\"M Mary Williams.\"\\nSomehow it didn\\'t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn\\'t look up seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.\\n\\xa0I wished the woman would say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was.\\n\\xa0But now she says:  \"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\"\\n\"Oh, yes\\'m, I did.\\n\\xa0Sarah Mary Williams.\\n\\xa0Sarah\\'s my first name.\\n\\xa0Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.\"\\n\"Oh, that\\'s the way of it?\"\\n\"Yes\\'m.\"\\nI was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t look up yet.\\nWell, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.\\n\\xa0She was right about the rats.\\nYou\\'d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while.\\n\\xa0She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn\\'t give her no peace.\\n\\xa0She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she\\'d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn\\'t know whether she could throw true now.\\n\\xa0But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said \"Ouch.\"\\nit hurt her arm so.\\n\\xa0Then she told me to try for the next one.\\n\\xa0I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn\\'t let on.\\n\\xa0I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he\\'d a stayed where he was he\\'d a been a tolerable sick rat.\\n\\xa0She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one.\\n\\xa0She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with.\\n\\xa0I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and went on talking about her and her husband\\'s matters.\\n\\xa0But she broke off to say:  \"Keep your eye on the rats.\\n\\xa0You better have the lead in your lap, handy.\"\\nSo she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking.\\n\\xa0But only about a minute.\\nThen she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says:  \"Come, now, what\\'s your real name?\"\\n\"Wh what, mum?\"\\n\"What\\'s your real name?\\n\\xa0Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?\\nor what is it?\"\\nI reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn\\'t know hardly what to do.\\n\\xa0But I says:  \"Please to don\\'t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.\\n\\xa0If I\\'m in the way here, I\\'ll.\"\\n\"No, you won\\'t.\\n\\xa0Set down and stay where you are.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t going to hurt you, and I ain\\'t going to tell on you, nuther.\\n\\xa0You just tell me your secret, and trust me.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll keep it; and, what\\'s more, I\\'ll help you.\\nSo\\'ll my old man if you want him to.\\n\\xa0You see, you\\'re a runaway \\'prentice, that\\'s all.\\n\\xa0It ain\\'t anything.\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t no harm in it.\\nYou\\'ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.\\n\\xa0Bless you, child, I wouldn\\'t tell on you.\\n\\xa0Tell me all about it now, that\\'s a good boy.\"\\nSo I said it wouldn\\'t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn\\'t go back on her promise.\\n\\xa0Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn\\'t stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter\\'s old clothes and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.\\n\\xa0I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.\\n\\xa0I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.\\n\"Goshen, child?\\n\\xa0This ain\\'t Goshen.\\n\\xa0This is St.\\nPetersburg.\\n\\xa0Goshen\\'s ten mile further up the river.\\n\\xa0Who told you this was Goshen?\"\\n\"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep.\\n\\xa0He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.\"\\n\"He was drunk, I reckon.\\n\\xa0He told you just exactly wrong.\"\\n\"Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain\\'t no matter now.\\n\\xa0I got to be moving along.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll fetch Goshen before daylight.\"\\n\"Hold on a minute.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll put you up a snack to eat.\\n\\xa0You might want it.\"\\nSo she put me up a snack, and says:  \"Say, when a cow\\'s laying down, which end of her gets up first?\\n\\xa0Answer up prompt now don\\'t stop to study over it.\\n\\xa0Which end gets up first?\"\\n\"The hind end, mum.\"\\n\"Well, then, a horse?\"\\n\"The for\\'rard end, mum.\"\\n\"Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?\"\\n\"North side.\"\\n\"If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction?\"\\n\"The whole fifteen, mum.\"\\n\"Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country.\\n\\xa0I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again.\\n\\xa0What\\'s your real name, now?\"\\n\"George Peters, mum.\"\\n\"Well, try to remember it, George.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t forget and tell me it\\'s Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it\\'s George Elexander when I catch you.\\n\\xa0And don\\'t go about women in that old calico.\\n\\xa0You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.\\n\\xa0Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don\\'t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that\\'s the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t\\'other way.\\n\\xa0And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot.\\nThrow stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy.\\n\\xa0And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don\\'t clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.\\n\\xa0Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain.\\n\\xa0Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs.\\nJudith Loftus, which is me, and I\\'ll do what I can to get you out of it.\\n\\xa0Keep the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you.\\nThe river road\\'s a rocky one, and your feet\\'ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.\"\\nI went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.\\n\\xa0I jumped in, and was off in a hurry.\\n\\xa0I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island, and then started across.\\n\\xa0I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn\\'t want no blinders on then.\\n\\xa0When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear eleven.\\n\\xa0When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\\nThen I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half below, as hard as I could go.\\n\\xa0I landed, and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern.\\n\\xa0There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground.\\n\\xa0I roused him out and says:  \"Git up and hump yourself, Jim!\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t a minute to lose.\\n\\xa0They\\'re after us.\"\\nJim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.\\n\\xa0By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.\\n\\xa0We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn\\'t show a candle outside after that.\\nI took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but if there was a boat around I couldn\\'t see it, for stars and shadows ain\\'t good to see by.\\n\\xa0Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still never saying a word.\\nIT must a been close on to one o\\'clock when we got below the island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.\\n\\xa0If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn\\'t come, for we hadn\\'t ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.\\n\\xa0We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.\\nIf the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come.\\n\\xa0Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn\\'t no fault of mine.\\n\\xa0I played it as low down on them as I could.\\nWhen the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there.\\n\\xa0A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\\nWe had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn\\'t afraid of anybody running across us.\\n\\xa0We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.\\n\\xa0I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn\\'t set down and watch a camp fire no, sir, she\\'d fetch a dog.\\n\\xa0Well, then, I said, why couldn\\'t she tell her husband to fetch a dog?\\n\\xa0Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn\\'t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\\n\\xa0So I said I didn\\'t care what was the reason they didn\\'t get us as long as they didn\\'t.\\nWhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry.\\nJim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves.\\n\\xa0Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.\\n\\xa0We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something.\\nWe fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn\\'t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a \"crossing\"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn\\'t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.\\nThis second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour.\\n\\xa0We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.\\n\\xa0It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn\\'t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn\\'t often that we laughed only a little kind of a low chuckle.\\n\\xa0We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all that night, nor the next, nor the next.\\nEvery night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.\\n\\xa0The fifth night we passed St.\\nLouis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\\nIn St.\\nPetersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St.\\nLouis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o\\'clock that still night.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t a sound there; everybody was asleep.\\nEvery night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o\\'clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents\\' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn\\'t roosting comfortable, and took him along.\\n\\xa0Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don\\'t want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain\\'t ever forgot.\\n\\xa0I never see pap when he didn\\'t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.\\nMornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind.\\n\\xa0Pap always said it warn\\'t no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn\\'t anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\\n\\xa0Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn\\'t borrow them any more then he reckoned it wouldn\\'t be no harm to borrow the others.\\n\\xa0So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what.\\n\\xa0But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p\\'simmons.\\n\\xa0We warn\\'t feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now.\\n\\xa0I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain\\'t ever good, and the p\\'simmons wouldn\\'t be ripe for two or three months yet.\\nWe shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn\\'t go to bed early enough in the evening.\\n\\xa0Take it all round, we lived pretty high.\\nThe fifth night below St.\\nLouis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet.\\nWe stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\\nWhen the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.\\n\\xa0By and by says I, \"Hel-_lo_, Jim, looky yonder.\"\\nIt was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\\n\\xa0We was drifting straight down for her.\\n\\xa0The lightning showed her very distinct.\\n\\xa0She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.\\nWell, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.\\n\\xa0I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was there.\\n\\xa0So I says:  \"Le\\'s land on her, Jim.\"\\nBut Jim was dead against it at first.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"I doan\\' want to go fool\\'n \\'long er no wrack.\\n\\xa0We\\'s doin\\' blame\\' well, en we better let blame\\' well alone, as de good book says.\\n\\xa0Like as not dey\\'s a watchman on dat wrack.\"\\n\"Watchman your grandmother.\"\\nI says; \"there ain\\'t nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody\\'s going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it\\'s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\"\\n\\xa0Jim couldn\\'t say nothing to that, so he didn\\'t try.\\n\\xa0\"And besides.\"\\nI says, \"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain\\'s stateroom.\\n\\xa0Seegars, I bet you and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.\\n\\xa0Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don\\'t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.\\n\\xa0Stick a candle in your pocket; I can\\'t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\\n\\xa0Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?\\n\\xa0Not for pie, he wouldn\\'t.\\nHe\\'d call it an adventure that\\'s what he\\'d call it; and he\\'d land on that wreck if it was his last act.\\n\\xa0And wouldn\\'t he throw style into it?\\nwouldn\\'t he spread himself, nor nothing?\\n\\xa0Why, you\\'d think it was Christopher C\\'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.\\n\\xa0I wish Tom Sawyer _was_ here.\"\\nJim he grumbled a little, but give in.\\n\\xa0He said we mustn\\'t talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low.\\n\\xa0The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.\\nThe deck was high out here.\\n\\xa0We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark we couldn\\'t see no sign of them.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain\\'s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down through the texas-hall we see a light!\\nand all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder!\\nJim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come along.\\n\\xa0I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say:  \"Oh, please don\\'t, boys; I swear I won\\'t ever tell.\"\\nAnother voice said, pretty loud:  \"It\\'s a lie, Jim Turner.\\n\\xa0You\\'ve acted this way before.\\n\\xa0You always want more\\'n your share of the truck, and you\\'ve always got it, too, because you\\'ve swore \\'t if you didn\\'t you\\'d tell.\\n\\xa0But this time you\\'ve said it jest one time too many.\\n\\xa0You\\'re the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country.\"\\nBy this time Jim was gone for the raft.\\n\\xa0I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn\\'t back out now, and so I won\\'t either; I\\'m a-going to see what\\'s going on here.\\n\\xa0So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn\\'t but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas.\\n\\xa0Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\\n\\xa0This one kept pointing the pistol at the man\\'s head on the floor, and saying:  \"I\\'d _like_ to!\\n\\xa0And I orter, too a mean skunk.\"\\nThe man on the floor would shrivel up and say, \"Oh, please don\\'t, Bill; I hain\\'t ever goin\\' to tell.\"\\nAnd every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:  \"\\'Deed you _ain\\'t!_ \\xa0You never said no truer thing \\'n that, you bet you.\"\\nAnd once he said: \\xa0\"Hear him beg!\\nand yit if we hadn\\'t got the best of him and tied him he\\'d a killed us both.\\n\\xa0And what _for_?\\n\\xa0Jist for noth\\'n.\\nJist because we stood on our _rights_ that\\'s what for.\\n\\xa0But I lay you ain\\'t a-goin\\' to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.\\n\\xa0Put _up_ that pistol, Bill.\"\\nBill says:  \"I don\\'t want to, Jake Packard.\\n\\xa0I\\'m for killin\\' him and didn\\'t he kill old Hatfield jist the same way and don\\'t he deserve it?\"\\n\"But I don\\'t _want_ him killed, and I\\'ve got my reasons for it.\"\\n\"Bless yo\\' heart for them words, Jake Packard!\\n\\xa0I\\'ll never forgit you long\\'s I live.\"\\nsays the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\\nPackard didn\\'t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come.\\n\\xa0I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn\\'t make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.\\n\\xa0The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says:  \"Here come in here.\"\\nAnd in he come, and Bill after him.\\n\\xa0But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.\\n\\xa0Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they\\'d been having.\\n\\xa0I was glad I didn\\'t drink whisky; but it wouldn\\'t made much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn\\'t a treed me because I didn\\'t breathe.\\n\\xa0I was too scared.\\n\\xa0And, besides, a body _couldn\\'t_ breathe and hear such talk.\\n\\xa0They talked low and earnest.\\n\\xa0Bill wanted to kill Turner.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"He\\'s said he\\'ll tell, and he will.\\n\\xa0If we was to give both our shares to him _now_ it wouldn\\'t make no difference after the row and the way we\\'ve served him.\\n\\xa0Shore\\'s you\\'re born, he\\'ll turn State\\'s evidence; now you hear _me_.\\n\\xa0I\\'m for putting him out of his troubles.\"\\n\"So\\'m I.\"\\nsays Packard, very quiet.\\n\"Blame it, I\\'d sorter begun to think you wasn\\'t.\\n\\xa0Well, then, that\\'s all right.\\n\\xa0Le\\'s go and do it.\"\\n\"Hold on a minute; I hain\\'t had my say yit.\\n\\xa0You listen to me.\\nShooting\\'s good, but there\\'s quieter ways if the thing\\'s _got_ to be done.\\nBut what I say is this: \\xa0it ain\\'t good sense to go court\\'n around after a halter if you can git at what you\\'re up to in some way that\\'s jist as good and at the same time don\\'t bring you into no resks.\\n\\xa0Ain\\'t that so?\"\\n\"You bet it is.\\n\\xa0But how you goin\\' to manage it this time?\"\\n\"Well, my idea is this: \\xa0we\\'ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we\\'ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck.\\nThen we\\'ll wait.\\n\\xa0Now I say it ain\\'t a-goin\\' to be more\\'n two hours befo\\' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.\\n\\xa0See?\\nHe\\'ll be drownded, and won\\'t have nobody to blame for it but his own self.\\n\\xa0I reckon that\\'s a considerble sight better \\'n killin\\' of him.\\n\\xa0I\\'m unfavorable to killin\\' a man as long as you can git aroun\\' it; it ain\\'t good sense, it ain\\'t good morals.\\n\\xa0Ain\\'t I right?\"\\n\"Yes, I reck\\'n you are.\\n\\xa0But s\\'pose she _don\\'t_ break up and wash off?\"\\n\"Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can\\'t we?\"\\n\"All right, then; come along.\"\\nSo they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled forward.\\nIt was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \"Jim.\"\\nand he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says:  \"Quick, Jim, it ain\\'t no time for fooling around and moaning; there\\'s a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don\\'t hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can\\'t get away from the wreck there\\'s one of \\'em going to be in a bad fix.\\n\\xa0But if we find their boat we can put _all_ of \\'em in a bad fix for the sheriff \\'ll get \\'em.\\nQuick hurry!\\n\\xa0I\\'ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard.\\nYou start at the raft, and.\"\\n\"Oh, my lordy, lordy!\\n\\xa0_raf\\'_?\\n\\xa0Dey ain\\' no raf\\' no mo\\'; she done broke loose en gone I en here we is.\"\\nWELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.\\n\\xa0Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that!\\n\\xa0But it warn\\'t no time to be sentimentering.\\n\\xa0We\\'d _got_ to find that boat now had to have it for ourselves.\\n\\xa0So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too seemed a week before we got to the stern.\\n\\xa0No sign of a boat.\\n\\xa0Jim said he didn\\'t believe he could go any further so scared he hadn\\'t hardly any strength left, he said.\\n\\xa0But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.\\n\\xa0So on we prowled again.\\n\\xa0We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water.\\n\\xa0When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!\\n\\xa0I could just barely see her.\\n\\xa0I felt ever so thankful.\\n\\xa0In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened.\\n\\xa0One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:  \"Heave that blame lantern out o\\' sight, Bill.\"\\nHe flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set down.\\n\\xa0It was Packard.\\n\\xa0Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.\\n\\xa0Packard says, in a low voice:  \"All ready shove off.\"\\nI couldn\\'t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.\\n\\xa0But Bill says:  \"Hold on \\'d you go through him?\"\\n\"No.\\n\\xa0Didn\\'t you?\"\\n\"No.\\n\\xa0So he\\'s got his share o\\' the cash yet.\"\\n\"Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.\"\\n\"Say, won\\'t he suspicion what we\\'re up to?\"\\n\"Maybe he won\\'t.\\n\\xa0But we got to have it anyway.\\nCome along.\"\\nSo they got out and went in.\\nThe door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.\\n\\xa0I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!\\nWe didn\\'t touch an oar, and we didn\\'t speak nor whisper, nor hardly even breathe.\\n\\xa0We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\\nWhen we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.\\nThen Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.\\n\\xa0Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the men I reckon I hadn\\'t had time to before.\\n\\xa0I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix.\\n\\xa0I says to myself, there ain\\'t no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would I like it?\\n\\xa0So says I to Jim:  \"The first light we see we\\'ll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a place where it\\'s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I\\'ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes.\"\\nBut that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this time worse than ever.\\n\\xa0The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon.\\n\\xa0We boomed along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our raft.\\n\\xa0After a long time the rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for it.\\nIt was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.\\n\\xa0We seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.\\n\\xa0So I said I would go for it.\\nThe skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck.\\n\\xa0We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light.\\n\\xa0As I got down towards it three or four more showed up on a hillside.\\n\\xa0It was a village.\\n\\xa0I closed in above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated.\\n\\xa0As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.\\n\\xa0I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between his knees.\\n\\xa0I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to cry.\\nHe stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:  \"Hello, what\\'s up?\\n\\xa0Don\\'t cry, bub.\\n\\xa0What\\'s the trouble?\"\\nI says:  \"Pap, and mam, and sis, and.\"\\nThen I broke down.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"Oh, dang it now, _don\\'t_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles, and this \\'n \\'ll come out all right.\\n\\xa0What\\'s the matter with \\'em?\"\\n\"They\\'re they\\'re are you the watchman of the boat?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nhe says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.\\n\\xa0\"I\\'m the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand; and sometimes I\\'m the freight and passengers.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can\\'t be so blame\\' generous and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he does; but I\\'ve told him a many a time \\'t I wouldn\\'t trade places with him; for, says I, a sailor\\'s life\\'s the life for me, and I\\'m derned if _I\\'d_ live two mile out o\\' town, where there ain\\'t nothing ever goin\\' on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it.\\n\\xa0Says I.\"\\nI broke in and says:  \"They\\'re in an awful peck of trouble, and.\"\\n\"_Who_ is?\"\\n\"Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you\\'d take your ferryboat and go up there.\"\\n\"Up where?\\n\\xa0Where are they?\"\\n\"On the wreck.\"\\n\"What wreck?\"\\n\"Why, there ain\\'t but one.\"\\n\"What, you don\\'t mean the Walter Scott?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Good land!\\nwhat are they doin\\' _there_, for gracious sakes?\"\\n\"Well, they didn\\'t go there a-purpose.\"\\n\"I bet they didn\\'t!\\n\\xa0Why, great goodness, there ain\\'t no chance for \\'em if they don\\'t git off mighty quick!\\n\\xa0Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?\"\\n\"Easy enough.\\n\\xa0Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town.\"\\n\"Yes, Booth\\'s Landing go on.\"\\n\"She was a-visiting there at Booth\\'s Landing, and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend\\'s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck.\\n\\xa0Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn\\'t notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!\\nI most wish \\'t it had been me, I do.\"\\n\"My George!\\n\\xa0It\\'s the beatenest thing I ever struck.\\n\\xa0And _then_ what did you all do?\"\\n\"Well, we hollered and took on, but it\\'s so wide there we couldn\\'t make nobody hear.\\n\\xa0So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow.\\nI was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn\\'t strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he\\'d fix the thing.\\n\\xa0I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, \\'What, in such a night and such a current?\\nThere ain\\'t no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.\\' \\xa0Now if you\\'ll go and.\"\\n\"By Jackson, I\\'d _like_ to, and, blame it, I don\\'t know but I will; but who in the dingnation\\'s a-going\\' to _pay_ for it?\\n\\xa0Do you reckon your pap.\"\\n\"Why _that\\'s_ all right.\\n\\xa0Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, that her uncle Hornback.\"\\n\"Great guns!\\nis _he_ her uncle?\\n\\xa0Looky here, you break for that light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a quarter of a mile out you\\'ll come to the tavern; tell \\'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback\\'s, and he\\'ll foot the bill.\\n\\xa0And don\\'t you fool around any, because he\\'ll want to know the news.\\n\\xa0Tell him I\\'ll have his niece all safe before he can get to town.\\n\\xa0Hump yourself, now; I\\'m a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.\"\\nI struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some woodboats; for I couldn\\'t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start.\\nBut take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would a done it.\\n\\xa0I wished the widow knowed about it.\\n\\xa0I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in.\\nWell, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down!\\nA kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her.\\n\\xa0She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn\\'t much chance for anybody being alive in her.\\n\\xa0I pulled all around her and hollered a little, but there wasn\\'t any answer; all dead still.\\n\\xa0I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they could stand it I could.\\nThen here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker\\'s remainders, because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river.\\nIt did seem a powerful long time before Jim\\'s light showed up; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.\\n\\xa0By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people.\\nBY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of seegars.\\n\\xa0We hadn\\'t ever been this rich before in neither of our lives.\\n\\xa0The seegars was prime.\\n\\xa0We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good time.\\nI told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he didn\\'t want no more adventures.\\n\\xa0He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died, because he judged it was all up with _him_ anyway it could be fixed; for if he didn\\'t get saved he would get drownded; and if he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure.\\n\\xa0Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger.\\nI read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, \\'stead of mister; and Jim\\'s eyes bugged out, and he was interested.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"I didn\\' know dey was so many un um.\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t hearn \\'bout none un um, skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat\\'s in a pack er k\\'yards.\\n\\xa0How much do a king git?\"\\n\"Get?\"\\n\\xa0I says; \"why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to them.\"\\n\"_Ain\\'_ dat gay?\\n\\xa0En what dey got to do, Huck?\"\\n\"_They_ don\\'t do nothing!\\n\\xa0Why, how you talk!\\nThey just set around.\"\\n\"No; is dat so?\"\\n\"Of course it is.\\n\\xa0They just set around except, maybe, when there\\'s a war; then they go to the war.\\n\\xa0But other times they just lazy around; or go hawking just hawking and sp Sh!\\nd\\' you hear a noise?\"\\nWe skipped out and looked; but it warn\\'t nothing but the flutter of a steamboat\\'s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsays I, \"and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the parlyment; and if everybody don\\'t go just so he whacks their heads off.\\nBut mostly they hang round the harem.\"\\n\"Roun\\' de which?\"\\n\"Harem.\"\\n\"What\\'s de harem?\"\\n\"The place where he keeps his wives.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t you know about the harem?\\nSolomon had one;

does a cat talk like we do?\"\\n\"No, a cat don\\'t.\"\\n\"Well, does a cow?\"\\n\"No, a cow don\\'t, nuther.\"\\n\"Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?\"\\n\"No, dey don\\'t.\"\\n\"It\\'s natural and right for \\'em to talk different from each other, ain\\'t it?\"\\n\"Course.\"\\n\"And ain\\'t it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from _us_?\"\\n\"Why, mos\\' sholy it is.\"\\n\"Well, then, why ain\\'t it natural and right for a _Frenchman_ to talk different from us?\\n\\xa0You answer me that.\"\\n\"Is a cat a man, Huck?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Well, den, dey ain\\'t no sense in a cat talkin\\' like a man.\\n\\xa0Is a cow a man?\\ner is a cow a cat?\"\\n\"No, she ain\\'t either of them.\"\\n\"Well, den, she ain\\'t got no business to talk like either one er the yuther of \\'em.\\n\\xa0Is a Frenchman a man?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"_Well_, den!\\n\\xa0Dad blame it, why doan\\' he _talk_ like a man?\\n\\xa0You answer me _dat_.\"\\nI see it warn\\'t no use wasting words you can\\'t learn a nigger to argue.\\nSo I quit.\\nWE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after.\\n\\xa0We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.\\nWell, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn\\'t do to try to run in a fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn\\'t anything but little saplings to tie to.\\n\\xa0I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went.\\n\\xa0I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn\\'t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me and then there warn\\'t no raft in sight; you couldn\\'t see twenty yards.\\n\\xa0I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke.\\n\\xa0But she didn\\'t come.\\n\\xa0I was in such a hurry I hadn\\'t untied her.\\n\\xa0I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn\\'t hardly do anything with them.\\nAs soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down the towhead.\\n\\xa0That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead warn\\'t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn\\'t no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.\\nThinks I, it won\\'t do to paddle; first I know I\\'ll run into the bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it\\'s mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time.\\n\\xa0I whooped and listened.\\n\\xa0Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits.\\n\\xa0I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again.\\n\\xa0The next time it come I see I warn\\'t heading for it, but heading away to the right of it.\\n\\xa0And the next time I was heading away to the left of it and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t\\'other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.\\nI did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me.\\n\\xa0Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop _behind_ me.\\n\\xa0I was tangled good now.\\n\\xa0That was somebody else\\'s whoop, or else I was turned around.\\nI throwed the paddle down.\\n\\xa0I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe\\'s head down-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don\\'t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.\\nThe whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.\\nIn another second or two it was solid white and still again.\\n\\xa0I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn\\'t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.\\nI just give up then.\\n\\xa0I knowed what the matter was.\\n\\xa0That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t\\'other side of it.\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes.\\n\\xa0It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide.\\nI kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.\\n\\xa0I was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don\\'t ever think of that.\\n\\xa0No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don\\'t think to yourself how fast _you\\'re_ going, but you catch your breath and think, my!\\nhow that snag\\'s tearing along.\\n\\xa0If you think it ain\\'t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once you\\'ll see.\\nNext, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn\\'t do it, and directly I judged I\\'d got into a nest of towheads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me sometimes just a narrow channel between, and some that I couldn\\'t see I knowed was there because I\\'d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks.\\n\\xa0Well, I warn\\'t long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o\\'-lantern.\\n\\xa0You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.\\nI had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing it was floating a little faster than what I was.\\nWell, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn\\'t hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.\\n\\xa0I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him.\\n\\xa0I was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn\\'t bother no more.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn\\'t help it; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.\\nBut I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern first.\\n\\xa0First I didn\\'t know where I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week.\\nIt was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see by the stars.\\n\\xa0I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the water.\\nI took after it; but when I got to it it warn\\'t nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together.\\n\\xa0Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this time I was right.\\n\\xa0It was the raft.\\nWhen I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar.\\n\\xa0The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt.\\n\\xa0So she\\'d had a rough time.\\nI made fast and laid down under Jim\\'s nose on the raft, and began to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:  \"Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?\\n\\xa0Why didn\\'t you stir me up?\"\\n\"Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?\\n\\xa0En you ain\\' dead you ain\\' drownded you\\'s back agin?\\n\\xa0It\\'s too good for true, honey, it\\'s too good for true.\\nLemme look at you chile, lemme feel o\\' you.\\n\\xa0No, you ain\\' dead!\\nyou\\'s back agin, \\'live en soun\\', jis de same ole Huck de same ole Huck, thanks to goodness.\"\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you, Jim?\\n\\xa0You been a-drinking?\"\\n\"Drinkin\\'?\\n\\xa0Has I ben a-drinkin\\'?\\n\\xa0Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin\\'?\"\\n\"Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?\"\\n\"How does I talk wild?\"\\n\"_How_?\\n\\xa0Why, hain\\'t you been talking about my coming back, and all that stuff, as if I\\'d been gone away?\"\\n\"Huck Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.\\n\\xa0_Hain\\'t_ you ben gone away?\"\\n\"Gone away?\\n\\xa0Why, what in the nation do you mean?\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t been gone anywheres.\\n\\xa0Where would I go to?\"\\n\"Well, looky here, boss, dey\\'s sumf\\'n wrong, dey is.\\n\\xa0Is I _me_, or who _is_ I?\\nIs I heah, or whah _is_ I?\\n\\xa0Now dat\\'s what I wants to know.\"\\n\"Well, I think you\\'re here, plain enough, but I think you\\'re a tangle-headed old fool, Jim.\"\\n\"I is, is I?\\n\\xa0Well, you answer me dis: \\xa0Didn\\'t you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas\\' to de tow-head?\"\\n\"No, I didn\\'t.\\n\\xa0What tow-head?\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t see no tow-head.\"\\n\"You hain\\'t seen no towhead?\\n\\xa0Looky here, didn\\'t de line pull loose en de raf\\' go a-hummin\\' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?\"\\n\"What fog?\"\\n\"Why, de fog!\\nde fog dat\\'s been aroun\\' all night.\\n\\xa0En didn\\'t you whoop, en didn\\'t I whoop, tell we got mix\\' up in de islands en one un us got los\\' en t\\'other one was jis\\' as good as los\\', \\'kase he didn\\' know whah he wuz?\\nEn didn\\'t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos\\' git drownded?\\n\\xa0Now ain\\' dat so, boss ain\\'t it so?\\n\\xa0You answer me dat.\"\\n\"Well, this is too many for me, Jim.\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t seen no fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.\\n\\xa0I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same.\\n\\xa0You couldn\\'t a got drunk in that time, so of course you\\'ve been dreaming.\"\\n\"Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?\"\\n\"Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn\\'t any of it happen.\"\\n\"But, Huck, it\\'s all jis\\' as plain to me as.\"\\n\"It don\\'t make no difference how plain it is; there ain\\'t nothing in it.\\nI know, because I\\'ve been here all the time.\"\\nJim didn\\'t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying over it.\\n\\xa0Then he says:  \"Well, den, I reck\\'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain\\'t de powerfullest dream I ever see.\\n\\xa0En I hain\\'t ever had no dream b\\'fo\\' dat\\'s tired me like dis one.\"\\n\"Oh, well, that\\'s all right, because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes.\\n\\xa0But this one was a staving dream; tell me all about it, Jim.\"\\nSo Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable.\\n\\xa0Then he said he must start in and \"\\'terpre.\"\\nit, because it was sent for a warning.\\n\\xa0He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but the current was another man that would get us away from him.\\n\\xa0The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn\\'t try hard to make out to understand them they\\'d just take us into bad luck, \\'stead of keeping us out of it.\\n\\xa0The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn\\'t talk back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn\\'t have no more trouble.\\nIt had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was clearing up again now.\\n\"Oh, well, that\\'s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim.\"\\nI says; \"but what does _these_ things stand for?\"\\nIt was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.\\n\\xa0You could see them first-rate now.\\nJim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash again.\\n\\xa0He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn\\'t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away.\\n\\xa0But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:  \"What do dey stan\\' for?\\n\\xa0I\\'se gwyne to tell you.\\n\\xa0When I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin\\' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos\\' broke bekase you wuz los\\', en I didn\\' k\\'yer no\\' mo\\' what become er me en de raf\\'.\\n\\xa0En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe en soun\\', de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo\\' foot, I\\'s so thankful.\\nEn all you wuz thinkin\\' \\'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie.\\n\\xa0Dat truck dah is _trash_; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren\\'s en makes \\'em ashamed.\"\\nThen he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without saying anything but that.\\n\\xa0But that was enough.\\n\\xa0It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.\\nIt was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn\\'t ever sorry for it afterwards, neither.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t do him no more mean tricks, and I wouldn\\'t done that one if I\\'d a knowed it would make him feel that way.\\nWE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.\\n\\xa0She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely.\\n\\xa0She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.\\n\\xa0There was a power of style about her.\\n\\xa0It _amounted_ to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.\\nWe went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot.\\n\\xa0The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn\\'t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.\\n\\xa0We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it.\\n\\xa0I said likely we wouldn\\'t, because I had heard say there warn\\'t but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn\\'t happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?\\n\\xa0Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show.\\n\\xa0But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again.\\nThat disturbed Jim and me too.\\n\\xa0So the question was, what to do?\\n\\xa0I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo.\\n\\xa0Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.\\nThere warn\\'t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it.\\n\\xa0He said he\\'d be mighty sure to see it, because he\\'d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he\\'d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.\\n\\xa0Every little while he jumps up and says:  \"Dah she is?\"\\nBut it warn\\'t.\\n\\xa0It was Jack-o\\'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before.\\n\\xa0Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.\\n\\xa0Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free and who was to blame for it?\\n\\xa0Why, _me_.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way.\\nIt got to troubling me so I couldn\\'t rest; I couldn\\'t stay still in one place.\\n\\xa0It hadn\\'t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing.\\n\\xa0But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more.\\n\\xa0I tried to make out to myself that I warn\\'t to blame, because I didn\\'t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn\\'t no use, conscience up and says, every time, \"But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.\"\\n\\xa0That was so I couldn\\'t get around that noway.\\n\\xa0That was where it pinched.\\n\\xa0Conscience says to me, \"What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word?\\n\\xa0What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean?\\n\\xa0Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how.\\n\\xa0_That\\'s_ what she done.\"\\nI got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.\\n\\xa0I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me.\\n\\xa0We neither of us could keep still.\\n\\xa0Every time he danced around and says, \"Dah\\'s Cairo.\"\\nit went through me like a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.\\nJim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself.\\n\\xa0He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn\\'t sell them, they\\'d get an Ab\\'litionist to go and steal them.\\nIt most froze me to hear such talk.\\n\\xa0He wouldn\\'t ever dared to talk such talk in his life before.\\n\\xa0Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free.\\n\\xa0It was according to the old saying, \"Give a nigger an inch and he\\'ll take an ell.\"\\n\\xa0Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking.\\n\\xa0Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children children that belonged to a man I didn\\'t even know; a man that hadn\\'t ever done me no harm.\\nI was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.\\n\\xa0My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, \"Let up on me it ain\\'t too late yet I\\'ll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.\"\\n\\xa0I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off.\\n\\xa0All my troubles was gone.\\n\\xa0I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself.\\n\\xa0By and by one showed.\\n\\xa0Jim sings out:  \"We\\'s safe, Huck, we\\'s safe!\\n\\xa0Jump up and crack yo\\' heels!\\n\\xa0Dat\\'s de good ole Cairo at las\\', I jis knows it.\"\\nI says:  \"I\\'ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim.\\n\\xa0It mightn\\'t be, you know.\"\\nHe jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:  \"Pooty soon I\\'ll be a-shout\\'n\\' for joy, en I\\'ll say, it\\'s all on accounts o\\' Huck; I\\'s a free man, en I couldn\\'t ever ben free ef it hadn\\' ben for Huck; Huck done it.\\n\\xa0Jim won\\'t ever forgit you, Huck; you\\'s de bes\\' fren\\' Jim\\'s ever had; en you\\'s de _only_ fren\\' ole Jim\\'s got now.\"\\nI was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.\\n\\xa0I went along slow then, and I warn\\'t right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn\\'t.\\n\\xa0When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:  \"Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on\\'y white genlman dat ever kep\\' his promise to ole Jim.\"\\nWell, I just felt sick.\\n\\xa0But I says, I _got_ to do it I can\\'t get _out_ of it.\\n\\xa0Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped.\\n\\xa0One of them says:  \"What\\'s that yonder?\"\\n\"A piece of a raft.\"\\nI says.\\n\"Do you belong on it?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"Any men on it?\"\\n\"Only one, sir.\"\\n\"Well, there\\'s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of the bend.\\n\\xa0Is your man white or black?\"\\nI didn\\'t answer up prompt.\\n\\xa0I tried to, but the words wouldn\\'t come.\\nI tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn\\'t man enough hadn\\'t the spunk of a rabbit.\\n\\xa0I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says:  \"He\\'s white.\"\\n\"I reckon we\\'ll go and see for ourselves.\"\\n\"I wish you would.\"\\nsays I, \"because it\\'s pap that\\'s there, and maybe you\\'d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.\\n\\xa0He\\'s sick and so is mam and Mary Ann.\"\\n\"Oh, the devil!\\nwe\\'re in a hurry, boy.\\n\\xa0But I s\\'pose we\\'ve got to.\\n\\xa0Come, buckle to your paddle, and let\\'s get along.\"\\nI buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.\\n\\xa0When we had made a stroke or two, I says:  \"Pap\\'ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.\\n\\xa0Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can\\'t do it by myself.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s infernal mean.\\n\\xa0Odd, too.\\n\\xa0Say, boy, what\\'s the matter with your father?\"\\n\"It\\'s the a the well, it ain\\'t anything much.\"\\nThey stopped pulling.\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t but a mighty little ways to the raft now.\\nOne says:  \"Boy, that\\'s a lie.\\n\\xa0What _is_ the matter with your pap?\\n\\xa0Answer up square now, and it\\'ll be the better for you.\"\\n\"I will, sir, I will, honest but don\\'t leave us, please.\\n\\xa0It\\'s the the Gentlemen, if you\\'ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won\\'t have to come a-near the raft please do.\"\\n\"Set her back, John, set her back.\"\\nsays one.\\n\\xa0They backed water.\\n\\xa0\"Keep away, boy keep to looard.\\n\\xa0Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us.\\n\\xa0Your pap\\'s got the small-pox, and you know it precious well.\\n\\xa0Why didn\\'t you come out and say so?\\n\\xa0Do you want to spread it all over?\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nsays I, a-blubbering, \"I\\'ve told everybody before, and they just went away and left us.\"\\n\"Poor devil, there\\'s something in that.\\n\\xa0We are right down sorry for you, but we well, hang it, we don\\'t want the small-pox, you see.\\n\\xa0Look here, I\\'ll tell you what to do.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t you try to land by yourself, or you\\'ll smash everything to pieces.\\n\\xa0You float along down about twenty miles, and you\\'ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.\\n\\xa0It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter.\\n\\xa0Now we\\'re trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that\\'s a good boy.\\n\\xa0It wouldn\\'t do any good to land yonder where the light is it\\'s only a wood-yard.\\nSay, I reckon your father\\'s poor, and I\\'m bound to say he\\'s in pretty hard luck.\\n\\xa0Here, I\\'ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by.\\n\\xa0I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom!\\nit won\\'t do to fool with small-pox, don\\'t you see?\"\\n\"Hold on, Parker.\"\\nsays the other man, \"here\\'s a twenty to put on the board for me.\\n\\xa0Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr.\\nParker told you, and you\\'ll be all right.\"\\n\"That\\'s so, my boy good-bye, good-bye.\\n\\xa0If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.\"\\n\"Good-bye, sir.\"\\nsays I; \"I won\\'t let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it.\"\\nThey went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn\\'t no use for me to try to learn to do right; a body that don\\'t get _started_ right when he\\'s little ain\\'t got no show when the pinch comes there ain\\'t nothing to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.\\n\\xa0Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s\\'pose you\\'d a done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?\\n\\xa0No, says I, I\\'d feel bad I\\'d feel just the same way I do now.\\n\\xa0Well, then, says I, what\\'s the use you learning to do right when it\\'s troublesome to do right and ain\\'t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?\\n\\xa0I was stuck.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t answer that.\\n\\xa0So I reckoned I wouldn\\'t bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time.\\nI went into the wigwam; Jim warn\\'t there.\\n\\xa0I looked all around; he warn\\'t anywhere.\\n\\xa0I says:  \"Jim.\"\\n\"Here I is, Huck.\\n\\xa0Is dey out o\\' sight yit?\\n\\xa0Don\\'t talk loud.\"\\nHe was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.\\n\\xa0I told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"I was a-listenin\\' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho\\' if dey come aboard.\\n\\xa0Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf\\' agin when dey was gone.\\n\\xa0But lawsy, how you did fool \\'em, Huck!\\n\\xa0Dat _wuz_ de smartes\\' dodge!\\n\\xa0I tell you, chile, I\\'spec it save\\' ole Jim ole Jim ain\\'t going to forgit you for dat, honey.\"\\nThen we talked about the money.\\n\\xa0It was a pretty good raise twenty dollars apiece.\\n\\xa0Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States.\\nHe said twenty mile more warn\\'t far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.\\nTowards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good.\\n\\xa0Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting.\\nThat night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend.\\nI went off in the canoe to ask about it.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.\\n\\xa0I ranged up and says:  \"Mister, is that town Cairo?\"\\n\"Cairo?\\nno.\\n\\xa0You must be a blame\\' fool.\"\\n\"What town is it, mister?\"\\n\"If you want to know, go and find out.\\n\\xa0If you stay here botherin\\' around me for about a half a minute longer you\\'ll get something you won\\'t want.\"\\nI paddled to the raft.\\n\\xa0Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.\\nWe passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn\\'t go.\\n\\xa0No high ground about Cairo, Jim said.\\nI had forgot it.\\n\\xa0We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank.\\n\\xa0I begun to suspicion something.\\n\\xa0So did Jim.\\n\\xa0I says:  \"Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.\"\\nHe says:  \"Doan\\' le\\'s talk about it, Huck.\\n\\xa0Po\\' niggers can\\'t have no luck.\\n\\xa0I awluz \\'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn\\'t done wid its work.\"\\n\"I wish I\\'d never seen that snake-skin, Jim I do wish I\\'d never laid eyes on it.\"\\n\"It ain\\'t yo\\' fault, Huck; you didn\\' know.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t you blame yo\\'self \\'bout it.\"\\nWhen it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!\\n\\xa0So it was all up with Cairo.\\nWe talked it all over.\\n\\xa0It wouldn\\'t do to take to the shore; we couldn\\'t take the raft up the stream, of course.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.\\n\\xa0So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!\\nWe didn\\'t say a word for a good while.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t anything to say.\\n\\xa0We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?\\n\\xa0It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.\\nBy and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn\\'t no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in.\\n\\xa0We warn\\'t going to borrow it when there warn\\'t anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us.\\nSo we shoved out after dark on the raft.\\nAnybody that don\\'t believe yet that it\\'s foolishness to handle a snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us.\\nThe place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.\\n\\xa0But we didn\\'t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more.\\n\\xa0Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog.\\n\\xa0You can\\'t tell the shape of the river, and you can\\'t see no distance.\\nIt got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river.\\n\\xa0We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it.\\n\\xa0Up-stream boats didn\\'t generly come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.\\nWe could hear her pounding along, but we didn\\'t see her good till she was close.\\n\\xa0She aimed right for us.\\n\\xa0Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he\\'s mighty smart.\\n\\xa0Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to try and shave us; but she didn\\'t seem to be sheering off a bit.\\n\\xa0She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us.\\n\\xa0There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft.\\nI dived and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.\\n\\xa0I could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half.\\n\\xa0Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting.\\n\\xa0I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit.\\n\\xa0Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her.\\nI sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn\\'t get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was \"treading water.\"\\nand struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.\\n\\xa0But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\\nIt was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over.\\n\\xa0I made a safe landing, and clumb up the bank.\\nI couldn\\'t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.\\n\\xa0I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.\\nIN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out, and says:  \"Be done, boys!\\n\\xa0Who\\'s there?\"\\nI says:  \"It\\'s me.\"\\n\"Who\\'s me?\"\\n\"George Jackson, sir.\"\\n\"What do you want?\"\\n\"I don\\'t want nothing, sir.\\n\\xa0I only want to go along by, but the dogs won\\'t let me.\"\\n\"What are you prowling around here this time of night for hey?\"\\n\"I warn\\'t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.\"\\n\"Oh, you did, did you?\\n\\xa0Strike a light there, somebody.\\n\\xa0What did you say your name was?\"\\n\"George Jackson, sir.\\n\\xa0I\\'m only a boy.\"\\n\"Look here, if you\\'re telling the truth you needn\\'t be afraid nobody\\'ll hurt you.\\n\\xa0But don\\'t try to budge; stand right where you are.\\n\\xa0Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns.\\n\\xa0George Jackson, is there anybody with you?\"\\n\"No, sir, nobody.\"\\nI heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.\\nThe man sung out:  \"Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool ain\\'t you got any sense?\\nPut it on the floor behind the front door.\\n\\xa0Bob, if you and Tom are ready, take your places.\"\\n\"All ready.\"\\n\"Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?\"\\n\"No, sir; I never heard of them.\"\\n\"Well, that may be so, and it mayn\\'t.\\n\\xa0Now, all ready.\\n\\xa0Step forward, George Jackson.\\n\\xa0And mind, don\\'t you hurry come mighty slow.\\n\\xa0If there\\'s anybody with you, let him keep back if he shows himself he\\'ll be shot.\\nCome along now.\\n\\xa0Come slow; push the door open yourself just enough to squeeze in, d\\' you hear?\"\\nI didn\\'t hurry; I couldn\\'t if I\\'d a wanted to.\\n\\xa0I took one slow step at a time and there warn\\'t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.\\n\\xa0The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me.\\nWhen I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting.\\n\\xa0I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said, \"There, that\\'s enough put your head in.\"\\nI done it, but I judged they would take it off.\\nThe candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me at them, for about a quarter of a minute: \\xa0Three big men with guns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other two thirty or more all of them fine and handsome and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I couldn\\'t see right well.\\n\\xa0The old gentleman says:  \"There; I reckon it\\'s all right.\\n\\xa0Come in.\"\\nAs soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows there warn\\'t none on the side.\\n\\xa0They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, \"Why, _he_ ain\\'t a Shepherdson no, there ain\\'t any Shepherdson about him.\"\\n\\xa0Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn\\'t mind being searched for arms, because he didn\\'t mean no harm by it it was only to make sure.\\n\\xa0So he didn\\'t pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right.\\n\\xa0He told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old lady says:  \"Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing\\'s as wet as he can be; and don\\'t you reckon it may be he\\'s hungry?\"\\n\"True for you, Rachel I forgot.\"\\nSo the old lady says:  \"Bets.\"\\n(this was a nigger woman), \"you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him oh, here he is himself.\\n\\xa0Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that\\'s dry.\"\\nBuck looked about as old as me thirteen or fourteen or along there, though he was a little bigger than me.\\n\\xa0He hadn\\'t on anything but a shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed.\\n\\xa0He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.\\nHe says:  \"Ain\\'t they no Shepherdsons around?\"\\nThey said, no, \\'twas a false alarm.\\n\"Well.\"\\nhe says, \"if they\\'d a ben some, I reckon I\\'d a got one.\"\\nThey all laughed, and Bob says:  \"Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you\\'ve been so slow in coming.\"\\n\"Well, nobody come after me, and it ain\\'t right I\\'m always kept down; I don\\'t get no show.\"\\n\"Never mind, Buck, my boy.\"\\nsays the old man, \"you\\'ll have show enough, all in good time, don\\'t you fret about that.\\n\\xa0Go \\'long with you now, and do as your mother told you.\"\\nWhen we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on.\\n\\xa0While I was at it he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out.\\n\\xa0I said I didn\\'t know; I hadn\\'t heard about it before, no way.\\n\"Well, guess.\"\\nhe says.\\n\"How\\'m I going to guess.\"\\nsays I, \"when I never heard tell of it before?\"\\n\"But you can guess, can\\'t you?\\n\\xa0It\\'s just as easy.\"\\n\"_Which_ candle?\"\\n\\xa0I says.\\n\"Why, any candle.\"\\nhe says.\\n\"I don\\'t know where he was.\"\\nsays I; \"where was he?\"\\n\"Why, he was in the _dark_!\\n\\xa0That\\'s where he was.\"\\n\"Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?\"\\n\"Why, blame it, it\\'s a riddle, don\\'t you see?\\n\\xa0Say, how long are you going to stay here?\\n\\xa0You got to stay always.\\n\\xa0We can just have booming times they don\\'t have no school now.\\n\\xa0Do you own a dog?\\n\\xa0I\\'ve got a dog and he\\'ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in.\\n\\xa0Do you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness?\\n\\xa0You bet I don\\'t, but ma she makes me.\\n\\xa0Confound these ole britches!\\n\\xa0I reckon I\\'d better put \\'em on, but I\\'d ruther not, it\\'s so warm.\\n\\xa0Are you all ready?\\nAll right.\\n\\xa0Come along, old hoss.\"\\nCold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk that is what they had for me down there, and there ain\\'t nothing better that ever I\\'ve come across yet.\\n\\xa0Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.\\n\\xa0They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.\\n\\xa0The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs.\\n\\xa0They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn\\'t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn\\'t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn\\'t belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here.\\n\\xa0So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it.\\n\\xa0Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was.\\nSo I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:  \"Can you spell, Buck?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nhe says.\\n\"I bet you can\\'t spell my name.\"\\nsays I.\\n\"I bet you what you dare I can.\"\\nsays he.\\n\"All right.\"\\nsays I, \"go ahead.\"\\n\"G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n there now.\"\\nhe says.\\n\"Well.\"\\nsays I, \"you done it, but I didn\\'t think you could.\\n\\xa0It ain\\'t no slouch of a name to spell right off without studying.\"\\nI set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it.\\nIt was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.\\n\\xa0I hadn\\'t seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style.\\n\\xa0It didn\\'t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in town.\\nThere warn\\'t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them.\\n\\xa0There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town.\\n\\xa0They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log.\\nThere was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it.\\n\\xa0It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out.\\n\\xa0They wouldn\\'t took any money for her.\\nWell, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.\\n\\xa0By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn\\'t open their mouths nor look different nor interested.\\n\\xa0They squeaked through underneath.\\n\\xa0There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things.\\n\\xa0On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn\\'t real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.\\nThis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.\\n\\xa0It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.\\n\\xa0There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.\\n\\xa0One was a big family Bible full of pictures.\\n\\xa0One was Pilgrim\\'s Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn\\'t say why.\\n\\xa0I read considerable in it now and then.\\n\\xa0The statements was interesting, but tough.\\n\\xa0Another was Friendship\\'s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn\\'t read the poetry.\\n\\xa0Another was Henry Clay\\'s Speeches, and another was Dr.\\nGunn\\'s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead.\\n\\xa0There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.\\n\\xa0And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\\nThey had pictures hung on the walls mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called \"Signing the Declaration.\"\\nThere was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old.\\n\\xa0They was different from any pictures I ever see before blacker, mostly, than is common.\\n\\xa0One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said \"Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.\"\\n\\xa0Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said \"I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\"\\n\\xa0There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said \"And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\"\\n\\xa0These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn\\'t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods.\\n\\xa0Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost.\\n\\xa0But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard.\\n\\xa0She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance.\\n\\xa0It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it.\\n\\xa0Other times it was hid with a little curtain.\\n\\xa0The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\\nThis young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.\\nIt was very good poetry.\\nThis is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:  ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC\\'D  And did young Stephen sicken, \\xa0 \\xa0And did young Stephen die?\\nAnd did the sad hearts thicken, \\xa0 \\xa0And did the mourners cry?\\nNo; such was not the fate of \\xa0 \\xa0Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad hearts round him thickened, \\xa0 \\xa0\\'Twas not from sickness\\' shots.\\nNo whooping-cough did rack his frame, \\xa0 \\xa0Nor measles drear with spots; Not these impaired the sacred name \\xa0 \\xa0Of Stephen Dowling Bots.\\nDespised love struck not with woe \\xa0 \\xa0That head of curly knots, Nor stomach troubles laid him low, \\xa0 \\xa0Young Stephen Dowling Bots.\\nO no.\\nThen list with tearful eye, \\xa0 \\xa0Whilst I his fate do tell.\\nHis soul did from this cold world fly \\xa0 \\xa0By falling down a well.\\nThey got him out and emptied him; \\xa0 \\xa0Alas it was too late; His spirit was gone for to sport aloft \\xa0 \\xa0In the realms of the good and great.\\nIf Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain\\'t no telling what she could a done by and by.\\n\\xa0Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing.\\n\\xa0She didn\\'t ever have to stop to think.\\n\\xa0He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn\\'t find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead.\\nShe warn\\'t particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.\\nEvery time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her \"tribut.\"\\nbefore he was cold.\\n\\xa0She called them tributes.\\nThe neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person\\'s name, which was Whistler.\\n\\xa0She warn\\'t ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long.\\n\\xa0Poor thing, many\\'s the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little.\\n\\xa0I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn\\'t going to let anything come between us.\\n\\xa0Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn\\'t seem right that there warn\\'t nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn\\'t seem to make it go somehow.\\n\\xa0They kept Emmeline\\'s room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.\\n\\xa0The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly.\\nWell, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the windows: \\xa0white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.\\n\\xa0There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing \"The Last Link is Broke.\"\\nand play \"The Battle of Pragu.\"\\non it.\\n\\xa0The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside.\\nIt was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place.\\n\\xa0Nothing couldn\\'t be better.\\n\\xa0And warn\\'t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!\\nCOL.\\n\\xa0Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.\\n\\xa0He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family.\\n\\xa0He was well born, as the saying is, and that\\'s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn\\'t no more quality than a mudcat himself.\\n\\xa0Col.\\n\\xa0Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say.\\n\\xa0His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders.\\nHis hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.\\n\\xa0He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn\\'t ever loud.\\n\\xa0He was as kind as he could be you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence.\\n\\xa0Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards.\\n\\xa0He didn\\'t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners everybody was always good-mannered where he was.\\n\\xa0Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always I mean he made it seem like good weather.\\n\\xa0When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn\\'t nothing go wrong again for a week.\\nWhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn\\'t set down again till they had set down.\\n\\xa0Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom\\'s and Bob\\'s was mixed, and then they bowed and said, \"Our duty to you, sir, and madam.\"\\nand _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\\nBob was the oldest and Tom next tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.\\n\\xa0They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.\\nThen there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn\\'t stirred up; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father.\\n\\xa0She was beautiful.\\nSo was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.\\n\\xa0She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\\nEach person had their own nigger to wait on them Buck too.\\n\\xa0My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn\\'t used to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck\\'s was on the jump most of the time.\\nThis was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\\nThe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.\\nSometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights.\\n\\xa0These people was mostly kinfolks of the family.\\n\\xa0The men brought their guns with them.\\n\\xa0It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.\\nThere was another clan of aristocracy around there five or six families mostly of the name of Shepherdson.\\n\\xa0They was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.\\n\\xa0The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses.\\nOne day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse coming.\\n\\xa0We was crossing the road.\\n\\xa0Buck says:  \"Quick!\\n\\xa0Jump for the woods.\"\\nWe done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier.\\n\\xa0He had his gun across his pommel.\\n\\xa0I had seen him before.\\n\\xa0It was young Harney Shepherdson.\\n\\xa0I heard Buck\\'s gun go off at my ear, and Harney\\'s hat tumbled off from his head.\\n\\xa0He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid.\\n\\xa0But we didn\\'t wait.\\n\\xa0We started through the woods on a run.\\n\\xa0The woods warn\\'t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn\\'t see.\\n\\xa0We never stopped running till we got home.\\n\\xa0The old gentleman\\'s eyes blazed a minute \\'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged then his face sort of smoothed down, and he says, kind of gentle:  \"I don\\'t like that shooting from behind a bush.\\n\\xa0Why didn\\'t you step into the road, my boy?\"\\n\"The Shepherdsons don\\'t, father.\\n\\xa0They always take advantage.\"\\nMiss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.\\n\\xa0The two young men looked dark, but never said nothing.\\n\\xa0Miss Sophia she turned pale, but the color come back when she found the man warn\\'t hurt.\\nSoon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves, I says:  \"Did you want to kill him, Buck?\"\\n\"Well, I bet I did.\"\\n\"What did he do to you?\"\\n\"Him?\\n\\xa0He never done nothing to me.\"\\n\"Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?\"\\n\"Why, nothing only it\\'s on account of the feud.\"\\n\"What\\'s a feud?\"\\n\"Why, where was you raised?\\n\\xa0Don\\'t you know what a feud is?\"\\n\"Never heard of it before tell me about it.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nsays Buck, \"a feud is this way: \\xa0A man has a quarrel with another man, and kills him; then that other man\\'s brother kills _him_; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the _cousins_ chip in and by and by everybody\\'s killed off, and there ain\\'t no more feud.\\n\\xa0But it\\'s kind of slow, and takes a long time.\"\\n\"Has this one been going on long, Buck?\"\\n\"Well, I should _reckon_!\\n\\xa0It started thirty year ago, or som\\'ers along there.\\n\\xa0There was trouble \\'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the man that won the suit which he would naturally do, of course.\\n\\xa0Anybody would.\"\\n\"What was the trouble about, Buck?\\nland?\"\\n\"I reckon maybe I don\\'t know.\"\\n\"Well, who done the shooting?\\n\\xa0Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?\"\\n\"Laws, how do I know?\\n\\xa0It was so long ago.\"\\n\"Don\\'t anybody know?\"\\n\"Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they don\\'t know now what the row was about in the first place.\"\\n\"Has there been many killed, Buck?\"\\n\"Yes; right smart chance of funerals.\\n\\xa0But they don\\'t always kill.\\n\\xa0Pa\\'s got a few buckshot in him; but he don\\'t mind it \\'cuz he don\\'t weigh much, anyway.\\n\\xa0Bob\\'s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom\\'s been hurt once or twice.\"\\n\"Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?\"\\n\"Yes; we got one and they got one.\\n\\xa0\\'Bout three months ago my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t\\'other side of the river, and didn\\'t have no weapon with him, which was blame\\' foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin\\' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and \\'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud \\'lowed he could out-run him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn\\'t any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode up and shot him down.\\n\\xa0But he didn\\'t git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.\"\\n\"I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.\"\\n\"I reckon he _warn\\'t_ a coward.\\n\\xa0Not by a blame\\' sight.\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons not a one.\\n\\xa0And there ain\\'t no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either.\\n\\xa0Why, that old man kep\\' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner.\\n\\xa0They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep\\' his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.\\n\\xa0Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home and one of \\'em was dead, and another died the next day.\\n\\xa0No, sir; if a body\\'s out hunting for cowards he don\\'t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz they don\\'t breed any of that _kind_.\"\\nNext Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody a-horseback.\\nThe men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.\\n\\xa0The Shepherdsons done the same.\\n\\xa0It was pretty ornery preaching all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don\\'t know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\\nAbout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.\\n\\xa0Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.\\n\\xa0I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.\\n\\xa0I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would.\\n\\xa0Then she said she\\'d forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody.\\n\\xa0I said I would.\\nSo I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn\\'t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn\\'t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it\\'s cool.\\n\\xa0If you notice, most folks don\\'t go to church only when they\\'ve got to; but a hog is different.\\nSays I to myself, something\\'s up; it ain\\'t natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament.\\n\\xa0So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with \"HALF-PAST TW.\"\\nwrote on it with a pencil.\\n\\xa0I ransacked it, but couldn\\'t find anything else.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.\\n\\xa0She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.\\n\\xa0She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty.\\n\\xa0I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her \"no, only coarse-hand.\"\\nand then she said the paper warn\\'t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.\\nI went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.\\n\\xa0When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes a-running, and says:  \"Mars Jawge, if you\\'ll come down into de swamp I\\'ll show you a whole stack o\\' water-moccasins.\"\\nThinks I, that\\'s mighty curious; he said that yesterday.\\n\\xa0He oughter know a body don\\'t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them.\\nWhat is he up to, anyway?\\n\\xa0So I says:  \"All right; trot ahead.\"\\nI followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile.\\n\\xa0We come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines, and he says:  \"You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah\\'s whah dey is.\\nI\\'s seed \\'m befo\\'; I don\\'t k\\'yer to see \\'em no mo\\'.\"\\nThen he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid him.\\n\\xa0I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying there asleep and, by jings, it was my old Jim!\\nI waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again, but it warn\\'t.\\n\\xa0He nearly cried he was so glad, but he warn\\'t surprised.\\n\\xa0Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard me yell every time, but dasn\\'t answer, because he didn\\'t want nobody to pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.\\n\\xa0Says he:  \"I got hurt a little, en couldn\\'t swim fas\\', so I wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las\\'; when you landed I reck\\'ned I could ketch up wid you on de lan\\' \\'dout havin\\' to shout at you, but when I see dat house I begin to go slow.\\n\\xa0I \\'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to you I wuz \\'fraid o\\' de dogs; but when it \\'uz all quiet agin I knowed you\\'s in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day.\\n\\xa0Early in de mawnin\\' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can\\'t track me on accounts o\\' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how you\\'s a-gitt\\'n along.\"\\n\"Why didn\\'t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?\"\\n\"Well, \\'twarn\\'t no use to \\'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn but we\\'s all right now.\\n\\xa0I ben a-buyin\\' pots en pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin\\' up de raf\\' nights when.\"\\n\"_What_ raft, Jim?\"\\n\"Our ole raf\\'.\"\\n\"You mean to say our old raft warn\\'t smashed all to flinders?\"\\n\"No, she warn\\'t.\\n\\xa0She was tore up a good deal one en\\' of her was; but dey warn\\'t no great harm done, on\\'y our traps was mos\\' all los\\'.\\n\\xa0Ef we hadn\\' dive\\' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn\\' ben so dark, en we warn\\'t so sk\\'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin\\' is, we\\'d a seed de raf\\'.\\n\\xa0But it\\'s jis\\' as well we didn\\'t, \\'kase now she\\'s all fixed up agin mos\\' as good as new, en we\\'s got a new lot o\\' stuff, in de place o\\' what \\'uz los\\'.\"\\n\"Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim did you catch her?\"\\n\"How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?\\n\\xa0No; some er de niggers foun\\' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben\\', en dey hid her in a crick \\'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin\\' \\'bout which un \\'um she b\\'long to de mos\\' dat I come to heah \\'bout it pooty soon, so I ups en settles de trouble by tellin\\' \\'um she don\\'t b\\'long to none uv um, but to you en me;

told me to come, and he\\'d show me a lot of water-moccasins.\\n\\xa0If anything happens _he_ ain\\'t mixed up in it.\\n\\xa0He can say he never seen us together, and it \\'ll be the truth.\"\\nI don\\'t want to talk much about the next day.\\n\\xa0I reckon I\\'ll cut it pretty short.\\n\\xa0I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was didn\\'t seem to be anybody stirring.\\n\\xa0That warn\\'t usual.\\n\\xa0Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone.\\nWell, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs nobody around; everything as still as a mouse.\\n\\xa0Just the same outside.\\n\\xa0Thinks I, what does it mean?\\n\\xa0Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says:  \"What\\'s it all about?\"\\nSays he:  \"Don\\'t you know, Mars Jawge?\"\\n\"No.\"\\nsays I, \"I don\\'t.\"\\n\"Well, den, Miss Sophia\\'s run off!\\n\\'deed she has.\\n\\xa0She run off in de night some time nobody don\\'t know jis\\' when; run off to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know leastways, so dey \\'spec.\\n\\xa0De fambly foun\\' it out \\'bout half an hour ago maybe a little mo\\' en\\' I _tell_ you dey warn\\'t no time los\\'.\\n\\xa0Sich another hurryin\\' up guns en hosses _you_ never see!\\n\\xa0De women folks has gone for to stir up de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him \\'fo\\' he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia.\\n\\xa0I reck\\'n dey\\'s gwyne to be mighty rough times.\"\\n\"Buck went off \\'thout waking me up.\"\\n\"Well, I reck\\'n he _did_!\\n\\xa0Dey warn\\'t gwyne to mix you up in it.\\n\\xa0Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en \\'lowed he\\'s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust.\\nWell, dey\\'ll be plenty un \\'m dah, I reck\\'n, en you bet you he\\'ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.\"\\nI took up the river road as hard as I could put.\\n\\xa0By and by I begin to hear guns a good ways off.\\n\\xa0When I come in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.\\n\\xa0There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn\\'t.\\nThere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn\\'t come it.\\n\\xa0Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.\\n\\xa0The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch both ways.\\nBy and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.\\n\\xa0They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle.\\n\\xa0All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run.\\n\\xa0They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.\\nThen the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them.\\n\\xa0They gained on the boys, but it didn\\'t do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.\\nOne of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old.\\nThe men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.\\n\\xa0As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him.\\n\\xa0He didn\\'t know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first.\\n\\xa0He was awful surprised.\\n\\xa0He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other wouldn\\'t be gone long.\\n\\xa0I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn\\'t come down.\\n\\xa0Buck begun to cry and rip, and \\'lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day yet.\\n\\xa0He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy.\\n\\xa0Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush.\\n\\xa0Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations the Shepherdsons was too strong for them.\\n\\xa0I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia.\\n\\xa0He said they\\'d got across the river and was safe.\\n\\xa0I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn\\'t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him I hain\\'t ever heard anything like it.\\nAll of a sudden, bang!\\nbang!\\nbang!\\ngoes three or four guns the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses!\\n\\xa0The boys jumped for the river both of them hurt and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, \"Kill them, kill them.\"\\n\\xa0It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t a-going to tell _all_ that happened it would make me sick again if I was to do that.\\n\\xa0I wished I hadn\\'t ever come ashore that night to see such things.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t ever going to get shut of them lots of times I dream about them.\\nI stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.\\nSometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on.\\n\\xa0I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn\\'t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow.\\nI judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess wouldn\\'t ever happened.\\nWhen I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could.\\n\\xa0I cried a little when I was covering up Buck\\'s face, for he was mighty good to me.\\nIt was just dark now.\\n\\xa0I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp.\\n\\xa0Jim warn\\'t on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.\\n\\xa0The raft was gone!\\n\\xa0My souls, but I was scared!\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t get my breath for most a minute.\\nThen I raised a yell.\\n\\xa0A voice not twenty-five foot from me says:  \"Good lan\\'!\\nis dat you, honey?\\n\\xa0Doan\\' make no noise.\"\\nIt was Jim\\'s voice nothing ever sounded so good before.\\n\\xa0I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"Laws bless you, chile, I \\'uz right down sho\\' you\\'s dead agin.\\n\\xa0Jack\\'s been heah; he say he reck\\'n you\\'s ben shot, kase you didn\\' come home no mo\\'; so I\\'s jes\\' dis minute a startin\\' de raf\\' down towards de mouf er de crick, so\\'s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead.\\n\\xa0Lawsy, I\\'s mighty glad to git you back again, honey.\"\\nI says:  \"All right that\\'s mighty good; they won\\'t find me, and they\\'ll think I\\'ve been killed, and floated down the river there\\'s something up there that \\'ll help them think so so don\\'t you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.\"\\nI never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi.\\n\\xa0Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more.\\n\\xa0I hadn\\'t had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens there ain\\'t nothing in the world so good when it\\'s cooked right and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time.\\n\\xa0I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp.\\n\\xa0We said there warn\\'t no home like a raft, after all.\\n\\xa0Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don\\'t.\\n\\xa0You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.\\nTWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.\\n\\xa0Here is the way we put in the time.\\n\\xa0It was a monstrous big river down there sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up nearly always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them.\\n\\xa0Then we set out the lines.\\n\\xa0Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come.\\n\\xa0Not a sound anywheres perfectly still just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe.\\n\\xa0The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line that was the woods on t\\'other side; you couldn\\'t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and warn\\'t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there\\'s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t\\'other side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they\\'ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you\\'ve got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\\nA little smoke couldn\\'t be noticed now, so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.\\n\\xa0And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by lazy off to sleep.\\n\\xa0Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the other side you couldn\\'t tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn\\'t be nothing to hear nor nothing to see just solid lonesomeness.\\n\\xa0Next you\\'d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they\\'re most always doing it on a raft; you\\'d see the axe flash and come down you don\\'t hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it\\'s above the man\\'s head then you hear the _k\\'chunk_!\\nit had took all that time to come over the water.\\n\\xa0So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.\\n\\xa0Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn\\'t run over them.\\n\\xa0A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing heard them plain; but we couldn\\'t see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.\\n\\xa0Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:  \"No; spirits wouldn\\'t say, \\'Dern the dern fog..\"\\nSoon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of things we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us the new clothes Buck\\'s folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn\\'t go much on clothes, nohow.\\nSometimes we\\'d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time.\\nYonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\\nIt\\'s lovely to live on a raft.\\n\\xa0We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.\\n\\xa0Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to _make_ so many.\\n\\xa0Jim said the moon could a _laid_ them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn\\'t say nothing against it, because I\\'ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done.\\nWe used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down.\\n\\xa0Jim allowed they\\'d got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.\\nOnce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn\\'t hear nothing for you couldn\\'t tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\\nAfter midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours the shores was black no more sparks in the cabin windows.\\n\\xa0These sparks was our clock the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.\\nOne morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore it was only two hundred yards and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn\\'t get some berries.\\nJust as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it.\\n\\xa0I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was _me_ or maybe Jim.\\n\\xa0I was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives said they hadn\\'t been doing nothing, and was being chased for it said there was men and dogs a-coming.\\n\\xa0They wanted to jump right in, but I says:  \"Don\\'t you do it.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t hear the dogs and horses yet; you\\'ve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in that\\'ll throw the dogs off the scent.\"\\nThey done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead, and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off, shouting.\\nWe heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn\\'t see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got further and further away all the time, we couldn\\'t hardly hear them at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe.\\nOne of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head and very gray whiskers.\\n\\xa0He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses no, he only had one.\\n\\xa0He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.\\nThe other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.\\n\\xa0After breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didn\\'t know one another.\\n\"What got you into trouble?\"\\nsays the baldhead to t\\'other chap.\\n\"Well, I\\'d been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off.\\n\\xa0So I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out _with_ you.\\nThat\\'s the whole yarn what\\'s yourn?\\n\"Well, I\\'d ben a-running\\' a little temperance revival thar \\'bout a week, and was the pet of the women folks, big and little, for I was makin\\' it mighty warm for the rummies, I _tell_ you, and takin\\' as much as five or six dollars a night ten cents a head, children and niggers free and business a-growin\\' all the time, when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I had a way of puttin\\' in my time with a private jug on the sly.\\n\\xa0A nigger rousted me out this mornin\\', and told me the people was getherin\\' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and they\\'d be along pretty soon and give me \\'bout half an hour\\'s start, and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they\\'d tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t wait for no breakfast I warn\\'t hungry.\"\\n\"Old man.\"\\nsaid the young one, \"I reckon we might double-team it together; what do you think?\"\\n\"I ain\\'t undisposed.\\n\\xa0What\\'s your line mainly?\"\\n\"Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines; theater-actor tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there\\'s a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change; sling a lecture sometimes oh, I do lots of things most anything that comes handy, so it ain\\'t work.\\n\\xa0What\\'s your lay?\"\\n\"I\\'ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time.\\n\\xa0Layin\\' on o\\' hands is my best holt for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I k\\'n tell a fortune pretty good when I\\'ve got somebody along to find out the facts for me.\\n\\xa0Preachin\\'s my line, too, and workin\\' camp-meetin\\'s, and missionaryin\\' around.\"\\nNobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh and says:  \"Alas.\"\\n\"What \\'re you alassin\\' about?\"\\nsays the bald-head.\\n\"To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded down into such company.\"\\n\\xa0And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag.\\n\"Dern your skin, ain\\'t the company good enough for you?\"\\nsays the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.\\n\"Yes, it _is_ good enough for me; it\\'s as good as I deserve; for who fetched me so low when I was so high?\\n\\xa0I did myself.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t blame _you_, gentlemen far from it; I don\\'t blame anybody.\\n\\xa0I deserve it all.\\n\\xa0Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know there\\'s a grave somewhere for me.\\nThe world may go on just as it\\'s always done, and take everything from me loved ones, property, everything; but it can\\'t take that.\\nSome day I\\'ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.\"\\n\\xa0He went on a-wiping.\\n\"Drot your pore broken heart.\"\\nsays the baldhead; \"what are you heaving your pore broken heart at _us_ f\\'r?\\n\\xa0_we_ hain\\'t done nothing.\"\\n\"No, I know you haven\\'t.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t blaming you, gentlemen.\\n\\xa0I brought myself down yes, I did it myself.\\n\\xa0It\\'s right I should suffer perfectly right I don\\'t make any moan.\"\\n\"Brought you down from whar?\\n\\xa0Whar was you brought down from?\"\\n\"Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes let it pass \\'tis no matter.\\n\\xa0The secret of my birth.\"\\n\"The secret of your birth!\\n\\xa0Do you mean to say.\"\\n\"Gentlemen.\"\\nsays the young man, very solemn, \"I will reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you.\\n\\xa0By rights I am a duke.\"\\nJim\\'s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.\\nThen the baldhead says: \\xa0\"No!\\nyou can\\'t mean it?\"\\n\"Yes.\\n\\xa0My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same time.\\n\\xa0The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates the infant real duke was ignored.\\n\\xa0I am the lineal descendant of that infant I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft.\"\\nJim pitied him ever so much, and so did I.\\nWe tried to comfort him, but he said it warn\\'t much use, he couldn\\'t be much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.\\n\\xa0He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say \"Your Grace.\"\\nor \"My Lord.\"\\nor \"Your Lordshi.\"\\nand he wouldn\\'t mind it if we called him plain \"Bridgewater.\"\\nwhich, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done.\\nWell, that was all easy, so we done it.\\n\\xa0All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, \"Will yo\\' Grace have some o\\' dis or some o\\' dat?\"\\nand so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him.\\nBut the old man got pretty silent by and by didn\\'t have much to say, and didn\\'t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke.\\n\\xa0He seemed to have something on his mind.\\n\\xa0So, along in the afternoon, he says:  \"Looky here, Bilgewater.\"\\nhe says, \"I\\'m nation sorry for you, but you ain\\'t the only person that\\'s had troubles like that.\"\\n\"No?\"\\n\"No you ain\\'t.\\n\\xa0You ain\\'t the only person that\\'s ben snaked down wrongfully out\\'n a high place.\"\\n\"Alas.\"\\n\"No, you ain\\'t the only person that\\'s had a secret of his birth.\"\\n\\xa0And, by jings, _he_ begins to cry.\\n\"Hold!\\n\\xa0What do you mean?\"\\n\"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?\"\\nsays the old man, still sort of sobbing.\\n\"To the bitter death.\"\\n\\xa0He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it, and says, \"That secret of your being: \\xa0speak.\"\\n\"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin.\"\\nYou bet you, Jim and me stared this time.\\n\\xa0Then the duke says:  \"You are what?\"\\n\"Yes, my friend, it is too true your eyes is lookin\\' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.\"\\n\"You!\\n\\xa0At your age!\\n\\xa0No!\\n\\xa0You mean you\\'re the late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.\"\\n\"Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude.\\n\\xa0Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin\\', exiled, trampled-on, and sufferin\\' rightful King of France.\"\\nWell, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn\\'t know hardly what to do, we was so sorry and so glad and proud we\\'d got him with us, too.\\n\\xa0So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort _him_.\\nBut he said it warn\\'t no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him \"Your Majesty.\"\\nand waited on him first at meals, and didn\\'t set down in his presence till he asked them.\\nSo Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t\\'other for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down.\\n\\xa0This done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable.\\n\\xa0But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn\\'t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke\\'s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the king says:  \"Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what\\'s the use o\\' your bein\\' sour?\\n\\xa0It \\'ll only make things oncomfortable.\\n\\xa0It ain\\'t my fault I warn\\'t born a duke, it ain\\'t your fault you warn\\'t born a king so what\\'s the use to worry?\\n\\xa0Make the best o\\' things the way you find \\'em, says I that\\'s my motto.\\n\\xa0This ain\\'t no bad thing that we\\'ve struck here plenty grub and an easy life come, give us your hand, duke, and le\\'s all be friends.\"\\nThe duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.\\n\\xa0It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.\\nIt didn\\'t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn\\'t no kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.\\n\\xa0But I never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it\\'s the best way; then you don\\'t have no quarrels, and don\\'t get into no trouble.\\n\\xa0If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn\\'t no objections, \\'long as it would keep peace in the family; and it warn\\'t no use to tell Jim, so I didn\\'t tell him.\\n\\xa0If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way.\\nTHEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running was Jim a runaway nigger?\\n\\xa0Says I:  \"Goodness sakes!\\nwould a runaway nigger run _south_?\"\\nNo, they allowed he wouldn\\'t.\\n\\xa0I had to account for things some way, so I says:  \"My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.\\n\\xa0Pa, he \\'lowed he\\'d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who\\'s got a little one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.\\n\\xa0Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he\\'d squared up there warn\\'t nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.\\n\\xa0That warn\\'t enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.\\n\\xa0Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we\\'d go down to Orleans on it.\\n\\xa0Pa\\'s luck didn\\'t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up no more.\\n\\xa0Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway nigger.\\n\\xa0We don\\'t run daytimes no more now; nights they don\\'t bother us.\"\\nThe duke says:  \"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll think the thing over I\\'ll invent a plan that\\'ll fix it.\\nWe\\'ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don\\'t want to go by that town yonder in daylight it mightn\\'t be healthy.\"\\nTowards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to shiver it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that.\\n\\xa0So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like.\\n\\xa0My bed was a straw tick better than Jim\\'s, which was a corn-shuck tick; there\\'s always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up.\\n\\xa0Well, the duke allowed he would take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn\\'t.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed warn\\'t just fitten for me to sleep on.\\n\\xa0Your Grace \\'ll take the shuck bed yourself.\"\\nJim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke says:  \"\\'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression.\\n\\xa0Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I submit; \\'tis my fate.\\n\\xa0I am alone in the world let me suffer; can bear it.\"\\nWe got away as soon as it was good and dark.\\n\\xa0The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town.\\n\\xa0We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by that was the town, you know and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right.\\n\\xa0When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o\\'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.\\n\\xa0It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn\\'t a turned in anyway if I\\'d had a bed, because a body don\\'t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight.\\n\\xa0My souls, how the wind did scream along!\\n\\xa0And every second or two there\\'d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you\\'d see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!\\nbum!\\nbum!\\nbumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager.\\n\\xa0The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn\\'t any clothes on, and didn\\'t mind.\\n\\xa0We didn\\'t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.\\nI had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always mighty good that way, Jim was.\\n\\xa0I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn\\'t no show for me; so I laid outside I didn\\'t mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn\\'t running so high now.\\n\\xa0About two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn\\'t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard.\\n\\xa0It most killed Jim a-laughing.\\n\\xa0He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.\\nI took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day.\\nThe king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.\\n\\xa0Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would \"lay out a campaign.\"\\nas they called it.\\nThe duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud.\\n\\xa0One bill said, \"The celebrated Dr.\\nArmand de Montalban, of Paris.\"\\nwould \"lecture on the Science of Phrenolog.\"\\nat such and such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and \"furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece.\"\\n\\xa0The duke said that was _him_.\\n\\xa0In another bill he was the \"world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London.\"\\n\\xa0In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a \"divining-rod.\"\\n\"dissipating witch spells.\"\\nand so on.\\n\\xa0By and by he says:  \"But the histrionic muse is the darling.\\n\\xa0Have you ever trod the boards, Royalty?\"\\n\"No.\"\\nsays the king.\\n\"You shall, then, before you\\'re three days older, Fallen Grandeur.\"\\nsays the duke.\\n\\xa0\"The first good town we come to we\\'ll hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III.\\nand the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet.\\nHow does that strike you?\"\\n\"I\\'m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you see, I don\\'t know nothing about play-actin\\', and hain\\'t ever seen much of it.\\n\\xa0I was too small when pap used to have \\'em at the palace.\\n\\xa0Do you reckon you can learn me?\"\\n\"Easy.\"\\n\"All right.\\n\\xa0I\\'m jist a-freezn\\' for something fresh, anyway.\\n\\xa0Le\\'s commence right away.\"\\nSo the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.\\n\"But if Juliet\\'s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin\\' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.\"\\n\"No, don\\'t you worry; these country jakes won\\'t ever think of that.\\nBesides, you know, you\\'ll be in costume, and that makes all the difference in the world; Juliet\\'s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed, and she\\'s got on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap.\\n\\xa0Here are the costumes for the parts.\"\\nHe got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was meedyevil armor for Richard III.\\nand t\\'other chap, and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.\\n\\xa0The king was satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart.\\nThere was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing.\\n\\xa0The king allowed he would go, too, and see if he couldn\\'t strike something.\\n\\xa0We was out of coffee, so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.\\nWhen we got there there warn\\'t nobody stirring; streets empty, and perfectly dead and still, like Sunday.\\n\\xa0We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn\\'t too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the woods.\\n\\xa0The king got the directions, and allowed he\\'d go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\\nThe duke said what he was after was a printing-office.\\n\\xa0We found it; a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.\\n\\xa0It was a dirty, littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.\\n\\xa0The duke shed his coat and said he was all right now.\\n\\xa0So me and the king lit out for the camp-meeting.\\nWe got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most awful hot day.\\n\\xa0There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around.\\n\\xa0The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the flies.\\n\\xa0There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\\nThe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger and held crowds of people.\\n\\xa0The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs.\\nThey didn\\'t have no backs.\\n\\xa0The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds.\\n\\xa0The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico.\\n\\xa0Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the children didn\\'t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt.\\n\\xa0Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks was courting on the sly.\\nThe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.\\n\\xa0He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to sing and so on.\\n\\xa0The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout.\\n\\xa0Then the preacher begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting, \"It\\'s the brazen serpent in the wilderness!\\n\\xa0Look upon it and live.\"\\n\\xa0And people would shout out, \"Glory!\\nA-a-_men_.\"\\n\\xa0And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:  \"Oh, come to the mourners\\' bench!\\ncome, black with sin!\\n(_Amen_!) come, sick and sore!\\n(_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind!\\n(_Amen_!) come, pore and needy, sunk in shame!\\n(_A-A-Men_!) come, all that\\'s worn and soiled and suffering!\\ncome with a broken spirit!\\ncome with a contrite heart!\\ncome in your rags and sin and dirt!\\nthe waters that cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open oh, enter in and be at rest.\"\\n(_A-A-Men_!\\n\\xa0_Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)  And so on.\\n\\xa0You couldn\\'t make out what the preacher said any more, on account of the shouting and crying.\\n\\xa0Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners\\' bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.\\nWell, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.\\n\\xa0He told them he was a pirate been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he\\'d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him, \"Don\\'t you thank me, don\\'t you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had.\"\\nAnd then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.\\n\\xa0Then somebody sings out, \"Take up a collection for him, take up a collection.\"\\n\\xa0Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \"Let _him_ pass the hat around.\"\\n\\xa0Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\\nSo the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said they\\'d think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn\\'t do no good, and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates.\\nWhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.\\n\\xa0And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods.\\n\\xa0The king said, take it all around, it laid over any day he\\'d ever put in in the missionarying line.\\n\\xa0He said it warn\\'t no use talking, heathens don\\'t amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.\\nThe duke was thinking _he\\'d_ been doing pretty well till the king come to show up, but after that he didn\\'t think so so much.\\n\\xa0He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office horse bills and took the money, four dollars.\\n\\xa0And he had got in ten dollars\\' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance so they done it.\\nThe price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.\\n\\xa0He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head three verses kind of sweet and saddish the name of it was, \"Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking hear.\"\\nand he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn\\'t charge nothing for it.\\n\\xa0Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he\\'d done a pretty square day\\'s work for it.\\nThen he showed us another little job he\\'d printed and hadn\\'t charged for, because it was for us.\\n\\xa0It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and \"$200 rewar.\"\\nunder it.\\n\\xa0The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot.\\n\\xa0It said he run away from St.\\nJacques\\' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses.\\n\"Now.\"\\nsays the duke, \"after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to.\\n\\xa0Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward.\\n\\xa0Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn\\'t go well with the story of us being so poor.\\n\\xa0Too much like jewelry.\\n\\xa0Ropes are the correct thing we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.\"\\nWe all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn\\'t be no trouble about running daytimes.\\n\\xa0We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke\\'s work in the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could boom right along if we wanted to.\\nWe laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o\\'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn\\'t hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.\\nWhen Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:  \"Huck, does you reck\\'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo\\' kings on dis trip?\"\\n\"No.\"\\nI says, \"I reckon not.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nsays he, \"dat\\'s all right, den.\\n\\xa0I doan\\' mine one er two kings, but dat\\'s enough.\\n\\xa0Dis one\\'s powerful drunk, en de duke ain\\' much better.\"\\nI found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and had so much trouble, he\\'d forgot it.\\nIT was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn\\'t tie up.\\n\\xa0The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after they\\'d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal.\\nAfter breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft, and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.\\n\\xa0When he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together.\\n\\xa0The duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done it pretty well; \"only.\"\\nhe says, \"you mustn\\'t bellow out _Romeo_!\\nthat way, like a bull you must say it soft and sick and languishy, so R-o-o-meo!\\nthat is the idea; for Juliet\\'s a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you know, and she doesn\\'t bray like a jackass.\"\\nWell, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight the duke called himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see.\\n\\xa0But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they\\'d had in other times along the river.\\nAfter dinner the duke says:  \"Well, Capet, we\\'ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so I guess we\\'ll add a little more to it.\\n\\xa0We want a little something to answer encores with, anyway.\"\\n\"What\\'s onkores, Bilgewater?\"\\nThe duke told him, and then says:  \"I\\'ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor\\'s hornpipe; and you well, let me see oh, I\\'ve got it you can do Hamlet\\'s soliloquy.\"\\n\"Hamlet\\'s which?\"\\n\"Hamlet\\'s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare.\\nAh, it\\'s sublime, sublime!\\n\\xa0Always fetches the house.\\n\\xa0I haven\\'t got it in the book I\\'ve only got one volume but I reckon I can piece it out from memory.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it back from recollection\\'s vaults.\"\\nSo he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next he would sigh, and next he\\'d let on to drop a tear.\\n\\xa0It was beautiful to see him.\\nBy and by he got it.\\n\\xa0He told us to give attention.\\n\\xa0Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.\\n\\xa0This is the speech I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it to the king:  To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so long life; For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane, But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep, Great nature\\'s second course, And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of.\\nThere\\'s the respect must give us pause: Wake Duncan with thy knocking!\\nI would thou couldst; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor\\'s wrong, the proud man\\'s contumely, The law\\'s delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take.\\nIn the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black, But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns, Breathes forth contagion on the world, And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i\\' the adage, Is sicklied o\\'er with care.\\nAnd all the clouds that lowered o\\'er our housetops, With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action.\\n\\'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.\\nBut soft you, the fair Ophelia: Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws.\\nBut get thee to a nunnery&mdash;go!\\nWell, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate.\\nIt seemed like he was just born for it; and when he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.\\nThe first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a most uncommon lively place, for there warn\\'t nothing but sword-fighting and rehearsing as the duke called it going on all the time.\\nOne morning, when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show.\\nWe struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses.\\nThe circus would leave before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance.\\nThe duke he hired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills.\\nThey read like this:  Shaksperean Revival!!!\\nWonderful Attraction!\\nFor One Night Only!\\nThe world renowned tragedians,  David Garrick the younger, of Drury Lane Theatre, London,  and  Edmund Kean the elder, of the Royal Haymarket Theatre, Whitechapel, Pudding Lane, Piccadilly, London, and the Royal Continental Theatres, in their sublime Shaksperean Spectacle entitled The Balcony Scene in  Romeo and Juliet!!!\\nRomeo......................................\\nMr.\\nGarrick.\\nJuliet.....................................\\nMr.\\nKean.\\nAssisted by the whole strength of the company!\\nNew costumes, new scenery, new appointments!\\nAlso:  The thrilling, masterly, and blood-curdling Broad-sword conflict In Richard III.!!!\\nRichard III................................\\nMr.\\nGarrick.\\nRichmond...................................\\nMr.\\nKean.\\nalso:  (by special request,)  Hamlet\\'s Immortal Soliloquy!!\\nBy the Illustrious Kean!\\nDone by him 300 consecutive nights in Paris!\\nFor One Night Only,  On account of imperative European engagements!\\nAdmission 25 cents; children and servants, 10 cents.\\nThen we went loafing around the town.\\nThe stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn\\'t ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed.\\nThe houses had little gardens around them, but they didn\\'t seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware.\\nThe fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn\\'t generly have but one hinge a leather one.\\nSome of the fences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus\\'s time, like enough.\\nThere was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.\\nAll the stores was along one street.\\n\\xa0They had white domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.\\nThere was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching a mighty ornery lot.\\nThey generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn\\'t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words.\\n\\xa0There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch.\\n\\xa0What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was:  \"Gimme a chaw \\'v tobacker, Hank.\"\\n\"Cain\\'t; I hain\\'t got but one chaw left.\\n\\xa0Ask Bill.\"\\nMaybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain\\'t got none.\\nSome of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own.\\n\\xa0They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, \"I wisht you\\'d len\\' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I ha.\"\\nwhich is a lie pretty much everytime; it don\\'t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain\\'t no stranger, so he says:  \"_You_ give him a chaw, did you?\\n\\xa0So did your sister\\'s cat\\'s grandmother.\\nYou pay me back the chaws you\\'ve awready borry\\'d off\\'n me, Lafe Buckner, then I\\'ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won\\'t charge you no back intrust, nuther.\"\\n\"Well, I _did_ pay you back some of it wunst.\"\\n\"Yes, you did \\'bout six chaws.\\n\\xa0You borry\\'d store tobacker and paid back nigger-head.\"\\nStore tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted.\\n\\xa0When they borrow a chaw they don\\'t generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it\\'s handed back, and says, sarcastic:  \"Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.\"\\nAll the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn\\'t nothing else _but_ mud mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in _all_ the places.\\n\\xa0The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres.\\n\\xa0You\\'d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she\\'d stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary.\\nAnd pretty soon you\\'d hear a loafer sing out, \"Hi!\\n\\xa0_so_ boy!\\nsick him, Tige.\"\\nand away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise.\\n\\xa0Then they\\'d settle back again till there was a dog fight.\\n\\xa0There couldn\\'t anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog fight unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.\\nOn the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in.\\nThe people had moved out of them.\\n\\xa0The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over.\\n\\xa0People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time.\\n\\xa0Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer.\\nSuch a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river\\'s always gnawing at it.\\nThe nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time.\\n\\xa0Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them in the wagons.\\n\\xa0There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I seen three fights.\\n\\xa0By and by somebody sings out:  \"Here comes old Boggs!\\nin from the country for his little old monthly drunk; here he comes, boys.\"\\nAll the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs.\\n\\xa0One of them says:  \"Wonder who he\\'s a-gwyne to chaw up this time.\\n\\xa0If he\\'d a-chawed up all the men he\\'s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he\\'d have considerable ruputation now.\"\\nAnother one says, \"I wisht old Boggs \\'d threaten me, \\'cuz then I\\'d know I warn\\'t gwyne to die for a thousan\\' year.\"\\nBoggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an Injun, and singing out:  \"Cler the track, thar.\\n\\xa0I\\'m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise.\"\\nHe was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old, and had a very red face.\\n\\xa0Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he\\'d attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn\\'t wait now because he\\'d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, \"Meat first, and spoon vittles to top off on.\"\\nHe see me, and rode up and says:  \"Whar\\'d you come f\\'m, boy?\\n\\xa0You prepared to die?\"\\nThen he rode on.\\n\\xa0I was scared, but a man says:  \"He don\\'t mean nothing; he\\'s always a-carryin\\' on like that when he\\'s drunk.\\n\\xa0He\\'s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober.\"\\nBoggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:  \"Come out here, Sherburn!\\nCome out and meet the man you\\'ve swindled.\\nYou\\'re the houn\\' I\\'m after, and I\\'m a-gwyne to have you, too.\"\\nAnd so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on.\\n\\xa0By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town, too steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come.\\n\\xa0He says to Boggs, mighty ca\\'m and slow he says:  \"I\\'m tired of this, but I\\'ll endure it till one o\\'clock.\\n\\xa0Till one o\\'clock, mind no longer.\\n\\xa0If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can\\'t travel so far but I will find you.\"\\nThen he turns and goes in.\\n\\xa0The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody stirred, and there warn\\'t no more laughing.\\n\\xa0Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up.\\n\\xa0Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he wouldn\\'t; they told him it would be one o\\'clock in about fifteen minutes, and so he _must_ go home he must go right away.\\n\\xa0But it didn\\'t do no good.\\n\\xa0He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying.\\nEverybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn\\'t no use up the street he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.\\n\\xa0By and by somebody says:  \"Go for his daughter!\\nquick, go for his daughter; sometimes he\\'ll listen to her.\\n\\xa0If anybody can persuade him, she can.\"\\nSo somebody started on a run.\\n\\xa0I walked down street a ways and stopped.\\nIn about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his horse.\\n\\xa0He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.\\nHe was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn\\'t hanging back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself.\\n\\xa0Somebody sings out:  \"Boggs.\"\\nI looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn.\\nHe was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in his right hand not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky.\\n\\xa0The same second I see a young girl coming on the run, and two men with her.\\n\\xa0Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level both barrels cocked.\\nBoggs throws up both of his hands and says, \"O Lord, don\\'t shoot.\"\\n\\xa0Bang!\\ngoes the first shot, and he staggers back, clawing at the air bang!\\ngoes the second one, and he tumbles backwards on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.\\n\\xa0That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying, \"Oh, he\\'s killed him, he\\'s killed him.\"\\n\\xa0The crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting, \"Back, back!\\ngive him air, give him air.\"\\nColonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned around on his heels and walked off.\\nThey took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.\\n\\xa0They laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.\\n\\xa0He made about a dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out and after that he laid still; he was dead.\\n\\xa0Then they pulled his daughter away from him, screaming and crying, and took her off.\\n\\xa0She was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.\\nWell, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that had the places wouldn\\'t give them up, and folks behind them was saying all the time, \"Say, now, you\\'ve looked enough, you fellows; \\'tain\\'t right and \\'tain\\'t fair for you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as you.\"\\nThere was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there was going to be trouble.\\n\\xa0The streets was full, and everybody was excited.\\nEverybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening.\\n\\xa0One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t\\'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, \"Boggs.\"\\nand then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says \"Bang.\"\\nstaggered backwards, says \"Bang.\"\\nagain, and fell down flat on his back.\\nThe people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all happened.\\n\\xa0Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.\\nWell, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.\\n\\xa0In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.\\nTHEY swarmed up towards Sherburn\\'s house, a-whooping and raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see.\\n\\xa0Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along the road was full of women\\'s heads, and there was nigger boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach.\\n\\xa0Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared most to death.\\nThey swarmed up in front of Sherburn\\'s palings as thick as they could jam together, and you couldn\\'t hear yourself think for the noise.\\n\\xa0It was a little twenty-foot yard.\\n\\xa0Some sung out \"Tear down the fence!\\ntear down the fence.\"\\n\\xa0Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.\\nJust then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca\\'m and deliberate, not saying a word.\\n\\xa0The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.\\nSherburn never said a word just stood there, looking down.\\n\\xa0The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.\\n\\xa0Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him, but they couldn\\'t; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky.\\nThen pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that\\'s got sand in it.\\nThen he says, slow and scornful:  \"The idea of _you_ lynching anybody!\\n\\xa0It\\'s amusing.\\n\\xa0The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_!\\n\\xa0Because you\\'re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a _man_?\\n\\xa0Why, a _man\\'s_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind as long as it\\'s daytime and you\\'re not behind him.\\n\"Do I know you?\\n\\xa0I know you clear through.\\nI was born and raised in the South, and I\\'ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around.\\nThe average man\\'s a coward.\\n\\xa0In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it.\\nIn the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot.\\n\\xa0Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people whereas you\\'re just _as_ brave, and no braver.\\n\\xa0Why don\\'t your juries hang murderers?\\n\\xa0Because they\\'re afraid the man\\'s friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark and it\\'s just what they _would_ do.\\n\"So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.\\n\\xa0Your mistake is, that you didn\\'t bring a man with you; that\\'s one mistake, and the other is that you didn\\'t come in the dark and fetch your masks.\\n\\xa0You brought _part_ of a man Buck Harkness, there and if you hadn\\'t had him to start you, you\\'d a taken it out in blowing.\\n\"You didn\\'t want to come.\\n\\xa0The average man don\\'t like trouble and danger.\\n_You_ don\\'t like trouble and danger.\\n\\xa0But if only _half_ a man like Buck Harkness, there shouts \\'Lynch him!\\nlynch him!\\' you\\'re afraid to back down afraid you\\'ll be found out to be what you are _cowards_ and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man\\'s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you\\'re going to do.\\nThe pitifulest thing out is a mob; that\\'s what an army is a mob; they don\\'t fight with courage that\\'s born in them, but with courage that\\'s borrowed from their mass, and from their officers.\\n\\xa0But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_ pitifulness.\\n\\xa0Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole.\\n\\xa0If any real lynching\\'s going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they\\'ll bring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along.\\n\\xa0Now _leave_ and take your half-a-man with yo.\"\\ntossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this.\\nThe crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable cheap.\\n\\xa0I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn\\'t want to.\\nI went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent.\\n\\xa0I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because there ain\\'t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers that way.\\n\\xa0You can\\'t be too careful.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain\\'t no other way, but there ain\\'t no use in _wasting_ it on them.\\nIt was a real bully circus.\\n\\xa0It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable there must a been twenty of them and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds.\\n\\xa0It was a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so lovely.\\n\\xa0And then one by one they got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady\\'s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.\\nAnd then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip and shouting \"Hi!\\nhi.\"\\nand the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves!\\n\\xa0And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.\\nWell, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.\\n\\xa0The ringmaster couldn\\'t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever _could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn\\'t noway understand.\\nWhy, I couldn\\'t a thought of them in a year.\\nAnd by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.\\n\\xa0They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn\\'t listen, and the whole show come to a standstill.\\n\\xa0Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \"Knock him down!\\nthrow him out.\"\\nand one or two women begun to scream.\\n\\xa0So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn\\'t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn\\'t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.\\n\\xa0So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on.\\nThe minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down.\\n\\xa0And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t\\'other one on t\\'other side, and the people just crazy.\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\\n\\xa0But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood!\\nand the horse a-going like a house afire too.\\n\\xa0He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn\\'t ever drunk in his life and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them.\\n\\xa0He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits.\\nAnd, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.\\nThen the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.\\n\\xa0Why, it was one of his own men!\\n\\xa0He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody.\\nWell, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn\\'t a been in that ringmaster\\'s place, not for a thousand dollars.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet.\\nAnyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time.\\nWell, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn\\'t only about twelve people there just enough to pay expenses.\\n\\xa0And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.\\n\\xa0So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn\\'t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned.\\n\\xa0He said he could size their style.\\n\\xa0So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.\\nWELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time.\\n\\xa0When the place couldn\\'t hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and at last when he\\'d got everybody\\'s expectations up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow.\\n\\xa0And but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny.\\nThe people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that they made him do it another time.\\nWell, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.\\nThen the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it.\\nTwenty people sings out:  \"What, is it over?\\n\\xa0Is that _all_?\"\\nThe duke says yes.\\n\\xa0Then there was a fine time.\\n\\xa0Everybody sings out, \"Sold.\"\\nand rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians.\\n\\xa0But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:  \"Hold on!\\n\\xa0Just a word, gentlemen.\"\\n\\xa0They stopped to listen.\\n\\xa0\"We are sold mighty badly sold.\\n\\xa0But we don\\'t want to be the laughing stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live.\\n\\xa0_No_.\\n\\xa0What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town!\\n\\xa0Then we\\'ll all be in the same boat.\\n\\xa0Ain\\'t that sensible?\"\\n(\"You bet it is!\\nthe jedge is right.\"\\neverybody sings out.) \"All right, then not a word about any sell.\\n\\xa0Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.\"\\nNext day you couldn\\'t hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was.\\n\\xa0House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way.\\n\\xa0When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.\\nThe third night the house was crammed again and they warn\\'t new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights.\\n\\xa0I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat and I see it warn\\'t no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.\\n\\xa0I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four of them went in.\\n\\xa0I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn\\'t stand it.\\n\\xa0Well, when the place couldn\\'t hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:  \"Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you.\"\\nI done it, and he done the same.\\n\\xa0We struck the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a word.\\nI reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:  \"Well, how\\'d the old thing pan out this time, duke?\"\\n\\xa0He hadn\\'t been up-town at all.\\nWe never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village.\\nThen we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they\\'d served them people.\\n\\xa0The duke says:  \"Greenhorns, flatheads!\\n\\xa0I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they\\'d lay for us the third night, and consider it was _their_ turn now.\\n\\xa0Well, it _is_ their turn, and I\\'d give something to know how much they\\'d take for it.\\n\\xa0I _would_ just like to know how they\\'re putting in their opportunity.\\n\\xa0They can turn it into a picnic if they want to they brought plenty provisions.\"\\nThem rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights.\\n\\xa0I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before.\\n\\xa0By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:  \"Don\\'t it s\\'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?\"\\n\"No.\"\\nI says, \"it don\\'t.\"\\n\"Why don\\'t it, Huck?\"\\n\"Well, it don\\'t, because it\\'s in the breed.\\n\\xa0I reckon they\\'re all alike.\"\\n\"But, Huck, dese kings o\\' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat\\'s jist what dey is; dey\\'s reglar rapscallions.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s what I\\'m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out.\"\\n\"Is dat so?\"\\n\"You read about them once you\\'ll see.\\n\\xa0Look at Henry the Eight; this \\'n \\'s a Sunday-school Superintendent to _him_.\\n\\xa0And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.\\n\\xa0My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.\\n\\xa0He _was_ a blossom.\\n\\xa0He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning.\\n\\xa0And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs.\\n\\xa0\\'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,\\' he says.\\n\\xa0They fetch her up.\\nNext morning, \\'Chop off her head!\\' \\xa0And they chop it off.\\n\\xa0\\'Fetch up Jane Shore,\\' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, \\'Chop off her head\\' and they chop it off.\\n\\xa0\\'Ring up Fair Rosamun.\\' \\xa0Fair Rosamun answers the bell.\\n\\xa0Next morning, \\'Chop off her head.\\' \\xa0And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book which was a good name and stated the case.\\n\\xa0You don\\'t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I\\'ve struck in history.\\n\\xa0Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country.\\nHow does he go at it give notice?\\ngive the country a show?\\n\\xa0No.\\n\\xa0All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on.\\n\\xa0That was _his_ style he never give anybody a chance.\\n\\xa0He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington.\\n\\xa0Well, what did he do?\\n\\xa0Ask him to show up?\\n\\xa0No drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.\\n\\xa0S\\'pose people left money laying around where he was what did he do?\\n\\xa0He collared it.\\n\\xa0S\\'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn\\'t set down there and see that he done it what did he do?\\n\\xa0He always done the other thing.\\nS\\'pose he opened his mouth what then?\\n\\xa0If he didn\\'t shut it up powerful quick he\\'d lose a lie every time.\\n\\xa0That\\'s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we\\'d a had him along \\'stead of our kings he\\'d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t say that ourn is lambs, because they ain\\'t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain\\'t nothing to _that_ old ram, anyway.\\n\\xa0All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances.\\n\\xa0Take them all around, they\\'re a mighty ornery lot.\\nIt\\'s the way they\\'re raised.\"\\n\"But dis one do _smell_ so like de nation, Huck.\"\\n\"Well, they all do, Jim.\\n\\xa0We can\\'t help the way a king smells; history don\\'t tell no way.\"\\n\"Now de duke, he\\'s a tolerble likely man in some ways.\"\\n\"Yes, a duke\\'s different.\\n\\xa0But not very different.\\n\\xa0This one\\'s a middling hard lot for a duke.\\n\\xa0When he\\'s drunk there ain\\'t no near-sighted man could tell him from a king.\"\\n\"Well, anyways, I doan\\' hanker for no mo\\' un um, Huck.\\n\\xa0Dese is all I kin stan\\'.\"\\n\"It\\'s the way I feel, too, Jim.\\n\\xa0But we\\'ve got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances.\\n\\xa0Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that\\'s out of kings.\"\\nWhat was the use to tell Jim these warn\\'t real kings and dukes?\\n\\xa0It wouldn\\'t a done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said: \\xa0you couldn\\'t tell them from the real kind.\\nI went to sleep, and Jim didn\\'t call me when it was my turn.\\n\\xa0He often done that.\\n\\xa0When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t take notice nor let on.\\n\\xa0I knowed what it was about.\\n\\xa0He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn\\'t ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their\\'n.\\n\\xa0It don\\'t seem natural, but I reckon it\\'s so.\\n\\xa0He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, \"Po\\' little \\'Lizabeth!\\npo\\' little Johnny!\\nit\\'s mighty hard; I spec\\' I ain\\'t ever gwyne to see you no mo\\', no mo\\'.\"\\n\\xa0He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.\\nBut this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones; and by and by he says:  \"What makes me feel so bad dis time \\'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I treat my little \\'Lizabeth so ornery.\\n\\xa0She warn\\'t on\\'y \\'bout fo\\' year ole, en she tuck de sk\\'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell; but she got well, en one day she was a-stannin\\' aroun\\', en I says to her, I says:  \"\\'Shet de do\\'.\\'\\n\"She never done it; jis\\' stood dah, kiner smilin\\' up at me.\\n\\xa0It make me mad; en I says agin, mighty loud, I says:  \"\\'Doan\\' you hear me?\\n\\xa0Shet de do\\'!\\'\\n\"She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin\\' up.\\n\\xa0I was a-bilin\\'!\\n\\xa0I says:  \"\\'I lay I _make_ you mine!\\'\\n\"En wid dat I fetch\\' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin\\'.\\nDen I went into de yuther room, en \\'uz gone \\'bout ten minutes; en when I come back dah was dat do\\' a-stannin\\' open _yit_, en dat chile stannin\\' mos\\' right in it, a-lookin\\' down and mournin\\', en de tears runnin\\' down.\\n\\xa0My, but I _wuz_ mad!\\n\\xa0I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis\\' den it was a do\\' dat open innerds jis\\' den, \\'long come de wind en slam it to, behine de chile, ker-BLAM!\\nen my lan\\', de chile never move\\'!\\n\\xa0My breff mos\\' hop outer me; en I feel so so I doan\\' know HOW I feel.\\n\\xa0I crope out, all a-tremblin\\', en crope aroun\\' en open de do\\' easy en slow, en poke my head in behine de chile, sof\\' en still, en all uv a sudden I says POW!\\njis\\' as loud as I could yell.\\n\\xa0_She never budge!_ \\xa0Oh, Huck, I bust out a-cryin\\' en grab her up in my arms, en say, \\'Oh, de po\\' little thing!\\n\\xa0De Lord God Amighty fogive po\\' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long\\'s he live!\\' \\xa0Oh, she was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb deef en dumb en I\\'d ben a-treat\\'n her so.\"\\nNEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.\\n\\xa0Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn\\'t take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.\\n\\xa0You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn\\'t look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know.\\nSo the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he\\'d cipher out some way to get around it.\\nHe was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.\\n\\xa0He dressed Jim up in King Lear\\'s outfit it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim\\'s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that\\'s been drownded nine days.\\n\\xa0Blamed if he warn\\'t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.\\n\\xa0Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:  Sick Arab but harmless when not out of his head.\\nAnd he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam.\\n\\xa0Jim was satisfied.\\n\\xa0He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound.\\n\\xa0The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\\n\\xa0Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn\\'t wait for him to howl.\\n\\xa0Why, he didn\\'t only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.\\nThese rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn\\'t be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time.\\n\\xa0They couldn\\'t hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he\\'d lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn\\'t put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t\\'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way meaning the devil, I reckon.\\n\\xa0We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his\\'n on, and he told me to put mine on.\\n\\xa0I done it, of course.\\n\\xa0The king\\'s duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.\\n\\xa0I never knowed how clothes could change a body before.\\n\\xa0Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he\\'d take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you\\'d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself.\\n\\xa0Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready.\\n\\xa0There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above the town been there a couple of hours, taking on freight.\\n\\xa0Says the king:  \"Seein\\' how I\\'m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.\\nLouis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.\\n\\xa0Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we\\'ll come down to the village on her.\"\\nI didn\\'t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.\\n\\xa0I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him.\\n\"Run her nose in shore.\"\\nsays the king.\\n\\xa0I done it.\\n\\xa0\"Wher\\' you bound for, young man?\"\\n\"For the steamboat; going to Orleans.\"\\n\"Git aboard.\"\\nsays the king.\\n\\xa0\"Hold on a minute, my servant \\'ll he\\'p you with them bags.\\n\\xa0Jump out and he\\'p the gentleman, Adolphu.\"\\nmeaning me, I see.\\nI done so, and then we all three started on again.\\n\\xa0The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.\\nHe asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he\\'d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.\\n\\xa0The young fellow says:  \"When I first see you I says to myself, \\'It\\'s Mr.\\nWilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.\\' \\xa0But then I says again, \\'No, I reckon it ain\\'t him, or else he wouldn\\'t be paddling up the river.\\' \\xa0You _ain\\'t_ him, are you?\"\\n\"No, my name\\'s Blodgett Elexander Blodgett _Reverend_ Elexander Blodgett, I s\\'pose I must say, as I\\'m one o\\' the Lord\\'s poor servants.\\n\\xa0But still I\\'m jist as able to be sorry for Mr.\\nWilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he\\'s missed anything by it which I hope he hasn\\'t.\"\\n\"Well, he don\\'t miss any property by it, because he\\'ll get that all right; but he\\'s missed seeing his brother Peter die which he mayn\\'t mind, nobody can tell as to that but his brother would a give anything in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn\\'t seen him since they was boys together and hadn\\'t ever seen his brother William at all that\\'s the deef and dumb one William ain\\'t more than thirty or thirty-five.\\n\\xa0Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year.\\n\\xa0Harvey and William\\'s the only ones that\\'s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven\\'t got here in time.\"\\n\"Did anybody send \\'em word?\"\\n\"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn\\'t going to get well this time.\\nYou see, he was pretty old, and George\\'s g\\'yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn\\'t seem to care much to live.\\n\\xa0He most desperately wanted to see Harvey and William, too, for that matter because he was one of them kind that can\\'t bear to make a will.\\n\\xa0He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he\\'d told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George\\'s g\\'yirls would be all right for George didn\\'t leave nothing.\\n\\xa0And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.\"\\n\"Why do you reckon Harvey don\\'t come?\\n\\xa0Wher\\' does he live?\"\\n\"Oh, he lives in England Sheffield preaches there hasn\\'t ever been in this country.\\n\\xa0He hasn\\'t had any too much time and besides he mightn\\'t a got the letter at all, you know.\"\\n\"Too bad, too bad he couldn\\'t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.\\nYou going to Orleans, you say?\"\\n\"Yes, but that ain\\'t only a part of it.\\n\\xa0I\\'m going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.\"\\n\"It\\'s a pretty long journey.\\n\\xa0But it\\'ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.\\nIs Mary Jane the oldest?\\n\\xa0How old is the others?\"\\n\"Mary Jane\\'s nineteen, Susan\\'s fifteen, and Joanna\\'s about fourteen that\\'s the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.\"\\n\"Poor things!\\nto be left alone in the cold world so.\"\\n\"Well, they could be worse off.\\n\\xa0Old Peter had friends, and they ain\\'t going to let them come to no harm.\\n\\xa0There\\'s Hobson, the Babtis\\' preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr.\\nRobinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and well, there\\'s a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey \\'ll know where to look for friends when he gets here.\"\\nWell, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow.\\n\\xa0Blamed if he didn\\'t inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter\\'s business which was a tanner; and about George\\'s which was a carpenter; and about Harvey\\'s which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on.\\n\\xa0Then he says:  \"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?\"\\n\"Because she\\'s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn\\'t stop there.\\n\\xa0When they\\'re deep they won\\'t stop for a hail.\\n\\xa0A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St.\\nLouis one.\"\\n\"Was Peter Wilks well off?\"\\n\"Oh, yes, pretty well off.\\n\\xa0He had houses and land, and it\\'s reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som\\'ers.\"\\n\"When did you say he died?\"\\n\"I didn\\'t say, but it was last night.\"\\n\"Funeral to-morrow, likely?\"\\n\"Yes, \\'bout the middle of the day.\"\\n\"Well, it\\'s all terrible sad; but we\\'ve all got to go, one time or another.\\nSo what we want to do is to be prepared; then we\\'re all right.\"\\n\"Yes, sir, it\\'s the best way.\\n\\xa0Ma used to always say that.\"\\nWhen we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she got off.\\n\\xa0The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after all.\\n\\xa0When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:  \"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpet-bags.\\n\\xa0And if he\\'s gone over to t\\'other side, go over there and git him.\\n\\xa0And tell him to git himself up regardless.\\n\\xa0Shove along, now.\"\\nI see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.\\n\\xa0When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had said it every last word of it.\\n\\xa0And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch.\\nI can\\'t imitate him, and so I ain\\'t a-going to try to; but he really done it pretty good.\\n\\xa0Then he says:  \"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?\"\\nThe duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards.\\n\\xa0So then they waited for a steamboat.\\nAbout the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they didn\\'t come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her.\\n\\xa0She sent out her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn\\'t land us.\\n\\xa0But the king was ca\\'m.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry \\'em, can\\'t it?\"\\nSo they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore.\\n\\xa0About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:  \"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher\\' Mr.\\nPeter Wilks lives?\"\\nthey give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, \"What d\\' I tell you?\"\\n\\xa0Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:  \"I\\'m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_ live yesterday evening.\"\\nSudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his back, and says:  \"Alas, alas, our poor brother gone, and we never got to see him; oh, it\\'s too, too hard.\"\\nThen he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn\\'t drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying.\\n\\xa0If they warn\\'t the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck.\\nWell, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about his brother\\'s last moments, and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they\\'d lost the twelve disciples.\\n\\xa0Well, if ever I struck anything like it, I\\'m a nigger.\\nIt was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race.\\nTHE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on their coats as they come.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.\\n\\xa0The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:  \"Is it _them_?\"\\nAnd somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:  \"You bet it is.\"\\nWhen we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the three girls was standing in the door.\\n\\xa0Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, but that don\\'t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was come.\\nThe king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it!\\n\\xa0Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times.\\nThen the king he hunched the duke private I see him do it and then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across each other\\'s shoulder, and t\\'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping, people saying \"Sh.\"\\nand all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.\\n\\xa0And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other\\'s necks, and hung their chins over each other\\'s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done.\\n\\xa0And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it.\\nThen one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t\\'other on t\\'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.\\n\\xa0Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show.\\n\\xa0I never see anything so disgusting.\\nWell, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile, but it\\'s a trial that\\'s sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother\\'s heart, because out of their mouths they can\\'t, words being too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.\\nAnd the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out.\\nMusic is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.\\nThen the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.: Rev.\\nMr.\\nHobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr.\\nBen Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr.\\nRobinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.\\nRev.\\nHobson and Dr.\\nRobinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting together that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t\\'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right.\\n\\xa0Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business.\\n\\xa0But the rest was on hand, and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn\\'t say nothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said \"Goo-goo goo-goo-go.\"\\nall the time, like a baby that can\\'t talk.\\nSo the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George\\'s family, or to Peter.\\n\\xa0And he always let on that Peter wrote him the things; but that was a lie: \\xa0he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.\\nThen Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king he read it out loud and cried over it.\\n\\xa0It give the dwelling-house and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar.\\n\\xa0So these two frauds said they\\'d go and fetch it up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.\\n\\xa0We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them yaller-boys.\\n\\xa0My, the way the king\\'s eyes did shine!\\n\\xa0He slaps the duke on the shoulder and says:  \"Oh, _this_ ain\\'t bully nor noth\\'n!\\n\\xa0Oh, no, I reckon not!\\n\\xa0Why, _bully_, it beats the Nonesuch, _don\\'t_ it?\"\\nThe duke allowed it did.\\n\\xa0They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king says:  \"It ain\\'t no use talkin\\'; bein\\' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that\\'s got left is the line for you and me, Bilge.\\n\\xa0Thish yer comes of trust\\'n to Providence.\\n\\xa0It\\'s the best way, in the long run.\\n\\xa0I\\'ve tried \\'em all, and ther\\' ain\\'t no better way.\"\\nMost everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust; but no, they must count it.\\n\\xa0So they counts it, and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short.\\n\\xa0Says the king:  \"Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars?\"\\nThey worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it.\\n\\xa0Then the duke says:  \"Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake I reckon that\\'s the way of it.\\n\\xa0The best way\\'s to let it go, and keep still about it.\\n\\xa0We can spare it.\"\\n\"Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t k\\'yer noth\\'n \\'bout that it\\'s the _count_ I\\'m thinkin\\' about.\\n\\xa0We want to be awful square and open and above-board here, you know.\\n\\xa0We want to lug this h-yer money up stairs and count it before everybody then ther\\' ain\\'t noth\\'n suspicious.\\n\\xa0But when the dead man says ther\\'s six thous\\'n dollars, you know, we don\\'t want to.\"\\n\"Hold on.\"\\nsays the duke.\\n\\xa0\"Le\\'s make up the deffisit.\"\\nand he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.\\n\"It\\'s a most amaz\\'n\\' good idea, duke you _have_ got a rattlin\\' clever head on you.\"\\nsays the king.\\n\\xa0\"Blest if the old Nonesuch ain\\'t a heppin\\' us out agin.\"\\nand _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up.\\nIt most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.\\n\"Say.\"\\nsays the duke, \"I got another idea.\\n\\xa0Le\\'s go up stairs and count this money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.\"\\n\"Good land, duke, lemme hug you!\\n\\xa0It\\'s the most dazzling idea \\'at ever a man struck.\\n\\xa0You have cert\\'nly got the most astonishin\\' head I ever see.\\nOh, this is the boss dodge, ther\\' ain\\'t no mistake \\'bout it.\\n\\xa0Let \\'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to this \\'ll lay \\'em out.\"\\nWhen we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile twenty elegant little piles.\\n\\xa0Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their chops.\\n\\xa0Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that\\'s left behind in the vale of sorrers.\\n\\xa0He has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that\\'s left fatherless and motherless.\\n\\xa0Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he would a done _more_ generous by \\'em if he hadn\\'t ben afeard o\\' woundin\\' his dear William and me.\\n\\xa0Now, _wouldn\\'t_ he?\\n\\xa0Ther\\' ain\\'t no question \\'bout it in _my_ mind.\\n\\xa0Well, then, what kind o\\' brothers would it be that \\'d stand in his way at sech a time?\\n\\xa0And what kind o\\' uncles would it be that \\'d rob yes, _rob_ sech poor sweet lambs as these \\'at he loved so at sech a time?\\n\\xa0If I know William and I _think_ I do he well, I\\'ll jest ask him.\"\\nHe turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.\\n\\xa0Then the king says, \"I knowed it; I reckon _that \\'ll_ convince anybody the way _he_ feels about it.\\n\\xa0Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money take it _all_.\\n\\xa0It\\'s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.\"\\nMary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.\\n\\xa0And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:  \"You _dear_ good souls!\\nhow _lovely_!\\nhow _could_ you.\"\\nWell, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was all busy listening.\\n\\xa0The king was saying in the middle of something he\\'d started in on  .\"\\nthey bein\\' partickler friends o\\' the diseased.\\n\\xa0That\\'s why they\\'re invited here this evenin\\'; but tomorrow we want _all_ to come everybody; for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it\\'s fitten that his funeral orgies sh\\'d be public.\"\\nAnd so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke he couldn\\'t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper, \"_Obsequies_, you old fool.\"\\nand folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people\\'s heads to him.\\n\\xa0The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and says:  \"Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart\\'s_ aluz right.\\n\\xa0Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral wants me to make \\'em all welcome.\\n\\xa0But he needn\\'t a worried it was jest what I was at.\"\\nThen he weaves along again, perfectly ca\\'m, and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.\\n\\xa0And when he done it the third time he says:  \"I say orgies, not because it\\'s the common term, because it ain\\'t obsequies bein\\' the common term but because orgies is the right term.\\nObsequies ain\\'t used in England no more now it\\'s gone out.\\n\\xa0We say orgies now in England.\\n\\xa0Orgies is better, because it means the thing you\\'re after more exact.\\n\\xa0It\\'s a word that\\'s made up out\\'n the Greek _orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover up; hence in_ter._ \\xa0So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public funeral.\"\\nHe was the _worst_ I ever struck.\\n\\xa0Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed right in his face.\\n\\xa0Everybody was shocked.\\n\\xa0Everybody says, \"Why, _doctor_.\"\\nand Abner Shackleford says:  \"Why, Robinson, hain\\'t you heard the news?\\n\\xa0This is Harvey Wilks.\"\\nThe king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:  \"Is it my poor brother\\'s dear good friend and physician?\\n\\xa0I.\"\\n\"Keep your hands off of me.\"\\nsays the doctor.\\n\\xa0\"_You_ talk like an Englishman, _don\\'t_ you?\\n\\xa0It\\'s the worst imitation I ever heard.\\n\\xa0_You_ Peter Wilks\\'s brother!\\n\\xa0You\\'re a fraud, that\\'s what you are.\"\\nWell, how they all took on!\\n\\xa0They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey \\'d showed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him not to hurt Harvey\\'s feelings and the poor girl\\'s feelings, and all that.\\n\\xa0But it warn\\'t no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn\\'t imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar.\\n\\xa0The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on _them_.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"I was your father\\'s friend, and I\\'m your friend; and I warn you as a friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he calls it.\\n\\xa0He is the thinnest kind of an impostor has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and you take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here, who ought to know better.\\n\\xa0Mary Jane Wilks, you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.\\n\\xa0Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out I _beg_ you to do it.\\n\\xa0Will you?\"\\nMary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome!\\n\\xa0She says:  \"_Here_ is my answer.\"\\n\\xa0She hove up the bag of money and put it in the king\\'s hands, and says, \"Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to, and don\\'t give us no receipt for it.\"\\nThen she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the hare-lip done the same on the other.\\n\\xa0Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud.\\n\\xa0The doctor says:  \"All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter.\\n\\xa0But I warn you all that a time \\'s coming when you\\'re going to feel sick whenever you think of this day.\"\\nAnd away he went.\\n\"All right, doctor.\"\\nsays the king, kinder mocking him; \"we\\'ll try and get \\'em to send for you.\"\\nwhich made them all laugh, and they said it was a prime good hit.\\nWELL, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for Uncle William, and she\\'d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it.\\nThe king said the cubby would do for his valley meaning me.\\nSo Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain but nice.\\n\\xa0She said she\\'d have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey\\'s way, but he said they warn\\'t.\\n\\xa0The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.\\n\\xa0There was an old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room with.\\n\\xa0The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings, and so don\\'t disturb them.\\n\\xa0The duke\\'s room was pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.\\nThat night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there, and I stood behind the king and the duke\\'s chairs and waited on them, and the niggers waited on the rest.\\n\\xa0Mary Jane she set at the head of the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said so said \"How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?\"\\nand \"Where, for the land\\'s sake, _did_ you get these amaz\\'n pickles?\"\\nand all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know.\\nAnd when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things.\\n\\xa0The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest if I didn\\'t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes.\\n\\xa0She says:  \"Did you ever see the king?\"\\n\"Who?\\n\\xa0William Fourth?\\n\\xa0Well, I bet I have he goes to our church.\"\\n\\xa0I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on.\\n\\xa0So when I says he goes to our church, she says:  \"What regular?\"\\n\"Yes regular.\\n\\xa0His pew\\'s right over opposite ourn on t\\'other side the pulpit.\"\\n\"I thought he lived in London?\"\\n\"Well, he does.\\n\\xa0Where _would_ he live?\"\\n\"But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?\"\\nI see I was up a stump.\\n\\xa0I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again.\\n\\xa0Then I says:  \"I mean he goes to our church regular when he\\'s in Sheffield.\\n\\xa0That\\'s only in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.\"\\n\"Why, how you talk Sheffield ain\\'t on the sea.\"\\n\"Well, who said it was?\"\\n\"Why, you did.\"\\n\"I _didn\\'t_ nuther.\"\\n\"You did.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t.\"\\n\"You did.\"\\n\"I never said nothing of the kind.\"\\n\"Well, what _did_ you say, then?\"\\n\"Said he come to take the sea _baths_ that\\'s what I said.\"\\n\"Well, then, how\\'s he going to take the sea baths if it ain\\'t on the sea?\"\\n\"Looky here.\"\\nI says; \"did you ever see any Congress-water?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?\"\\n\"Why, no.\"\\n\"Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath.\"\\n\"How does he get it, then?\"\\n\"Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water in barrels.\\n\\xa0There in the palace at Sheffield they\\'ve got furnaces, and he wants his water hot.\\n\\xa0They can\\'t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.\\nThey haven\\'t got no conveniences for it.\"\\n\"Oh, I see, now.\\n\\xa0You might a said that in the first place and saved time.\"\\nWhen she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was comfortable and glad.\\n\\xa0Next, she says:  \"Do you go to church, too?\"\\n\"Yes regular.\"\\n\"Where do you set?\"\\n\"Why, in our pew.\"\\n\"_Whose_ pew?\"\\n\"Why, _ourn_ your Uncle Harvey\\'s.\"\\n\"His\\'n?\\n\\xa0What does _he_ want with a pew?\"\\n\"Wants it to set in.\\n\\xa0What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?\"\\n\"Why, I thought he\\'d be in the pulpit.\"\\nRot him, I forgot he was a preacher.\\n\\xa0I see I was up a stump again, so I played another chicken bone and got another think.\\n\\xa0Then I says:  \"Blame it, do you suppose there ain\\'t but one preacher to a church?\"\\n\"Why, what do they want with more?\"\\n\"What!\\nto preach before a king?\\n\\xa0I never did see such a girl as you.\\nThey don\\'t have no less than seventeen.\"\\n\"Seventeen!\\n\\xa0My land!\\n\\xa0Why, I wouldn\\'t set out such a string as that, not if I _never_ got to glory.\\n\\xa0It must take \\'em a week.\"\\n\"Shucks, they don\\'t _all_ of \\'em preach the same day only _one_ of \\'em.\"\\n\"Well, then, what does the rest of \\'em do?\"\\n\"Oh, nothing much.\\n\\xa0Loll around, pass the plate and one thing or another.\\n\\xa0But mainly they don\\'t do nothing.\"\\n\"Well, then, what are they _for_?\"\\n\"Why, they\\'re for _style_.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t you know nothing?\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t _want_ to know no such foolishness as that.\\n\\xa0How is servants treated in England?\\n\\xa0Do they treat \\'em better \\'n we treat our niggers?\"\\n\"_No_!\\n\\xa0A servant ain\\'t nobody there.\\n\\xa0They treat them worse than dogs.\"\\n\"Don\\'t they give \\'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year\\'s week, and Fourth of July?\"\\n\"Oh, just listen!\\n\\xa0A body could tell _you_ hain\\'t ever been to England by that.\\n\\xa0Why, Hare-l why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year\\'s end to year\\'s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.\"\\n\"Nor church?\"\\n\"Nor church.\"\\n\"But _you_ always went to church.\"\\nWell, I was gone up again.\\n\\xa0I forgot I was the old man\\'s servant.\\n\\xa0But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being the law.\\n\\xa0But I didn\\'t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she warn\\'t satisfied.\\n\\xa0She says:  \"Honest injun, now, hain\\'t you been telling me a lot of lies?\"\\n\"Honest injun.\"\\nsays I.\\n\"None of it at all?\"\\n\"None of it at all.\\n\\xa0Not a lie in it.\"\\nsays I.\\n\"Lay your hand on this book and say it.\"\\nI see it warn\\'t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said it.\\n\\xa0So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:  \"Well, then, I\\'ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I\\'ll believe the rest.\"\\n\"What is it you won\\'t believe, Joe?\"\\nsays Mary Jane, stepping in with Susan behind her.\\n\\xa0\"It ain\\'t right nor kind for you to talk so to him, and him a stranger and so far from his people.\\n\\xa0How would you like to be treated so?\"\\n\"That\\'s always your way, Maim always sailing in to help somebody before they\\'re hurt.\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t done nothing to him.\\n\\xa0He\\'s told some stretchers, I reckon, and I said I wouldn\\'t swallow it all; and that\\'s every bit and grain I _did_ say.\\n\\xa0I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can\\'t he?\"\\n\"I don\\'t care whether \\'twas little or whether \\'twas big; he\\'s here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn\\'t good of you to say it.\\n\\xa0If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn\\'t to say a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.\"\\n\"Why, Mam, he said.\"\\n\"It don\\'t make no difference what he _said_ that ain\\'t the thing.\\n\\xa0The thing is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to make him remember he ain\\'t in his own country and amongst his own folks.\"\\nI says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I\\'m letting that old reptile rob her of her money!\\nThen Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you\\'ll believe me, she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb!\\nSays I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I\\'m letting him rob her of her money!\\nThen Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again which was her way; but when she got done there warn\\'t hardly anything left o\\' poor Hare-lip.\\n\\xa0So she hollered.\\n\"All right, then.\"\\nsays the other girls; \"you just ask his pardon.\"\\nShe done it, too; and she done it beautiful.\\n\\xa0She done it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do it again.\\nI says to myself, this is _another_ one that I\\'m letting him rob her of her money.\\n\\xa0And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.\\n\\xa0I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind\\'s made up; I\\'ll hive that money for them or bust.\\nSo then I lit out for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.\\n\\xa0When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over.\\n\\xa0I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?\\n\\xa0No that won\\'t do.\\nHe might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me.\\n\\xa0Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?\\n\\xa0No I dasn\\'t do it.\\nHer face would give them a hint, sure; they\\'ve got the money, and they\\'d slide right out and get away with it.\\n\\xa0If she was to fetch in help I\\'d get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge.\\n\\xa0No; there ain\\'t no good way but one.\\n\\xa0I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won\\'t suspicion that I done it.\\nThey\\'ve got a good thing here, and they ain\\'t a-going to leave till they\\'ve played this family and this town for all they\\'re worth, so I\\'ll find a chance time enough.\\nI\\'ll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I\\'m away down the river, I\\'ll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it\\'s hid.\\n\\xa0But I better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn\\'t let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet.\\nSo, thinks I, I\\'ll go and search them rooms.\\n\\xa0Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke\\'s room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn\\'t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there.\\n\\xa0But I see I couldn\\'t do nothing without a candle, and I dasn\\'t light one, of course.\\n\\xa0So I judged I\\'d got to do the other thing lay for them and eavesdrop.\\n\\xa0About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn\\'t where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane\\'s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\\nThey come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed.\\n\\xa0Then I was glad I hadn\\'t found the bed when I wanted it.\\n\\xa0And yet, you know, it\\'s kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private.\\n\\xa0They sets down then, and the king says:  \"Well, what is it?\\n\\xa0And cut it middlin\\' short, because it\\'s better for us to be down there a-whoopin\\' up the mournin\\' than up here givin\\' \\'em a chance to talk us over.\"\\n\"Well, this is it, Capet.\\n\\xa0I ain\\'t easy; I ain\\'t comfortable.\\n\\xa0That doctor lays on my mind.\\n\\xa0I wanted to know your plans.\\n\\xa0I\\'ve got a notion, and I think it\\'s a sound one.\"\\n\"What is it, duke?\"\\n\"That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we\\'ve got.\\n\\xa0Specially, seeing we got it so easy _given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back.\\n\\xa0I\\'m for knocking off and lighting out.\"\\nThat made me feel pretty bad.\\n\\xa0About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says:  \"What!\\n\\xa0And not sell out the rest o\\' the property?\\n\\xa0March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous\\'n\\' dollars\\' worth o\\' property layin\\' around jest sufferin\\' to be scooped in?\\nand all good, salable stuff, too.\"\\nThe duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn\\'t want to go no deeper didn\\'t want to rob a lot of orphans of _everything_ they had.\\n\"Why, how you talk.\"\\nsays the king.\\n\\xa0\"We sha\\'n\\'t rob \\'em of nothing at all but jest this money.\\n\\xa0The people that _buys_ the property is the suff\\'rers; because as soon \\'s it\\'s found out \\'at we didn\\'t own it which won\\'t be long after we\\'ve slid the sale won\\'t be valid, and it \\'ll all go back to the estate.\\n\\xa0These yer orphans \\'ll git their house back agin, and that\\'s enough for _them_; they\\'re young and spry, and k\\'n easy earn a livin\\'.\\n\\xa0_they_ ain\\'t a-goin to suffer.\\n\\xa0Why, jest think there\\'s thous\\'n\\'s and thous\\'n\\'s that ain\\'t nigh so well off.\\n\\xa0Bless you, _they_ ain\\'t got noth\\'n\\' to complain of.\"\\nWell, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them.\\n\\xa0But the king says:  \"Cuss the doctor!\\n\\xa0What do we k\\'yer for _him_?\\n\\xa0Hain\\'t we got all the fools in town on our side?\\n\\xa0And ain\\'t that a big enough majority in any town?\"\\nSo they got ready to go down stairs again.\\n\\xa0The duke says:  \"I don\\'t think we put that money in a good place.\"\\nThat cheered me up.\\n\\xa0I\\'d begun to think I warn\\'t going to get a hint of no kind to help me.\\n\\xa0The king says:  \"Why?\"\\n\"Because Mary Jane \\'ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put \\'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?\"\\n\"Your head\\'s level agin, duke.\"\\nsays the king; and he comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was.\\n\\xa0I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I\\'d better do if they did catch me.\\n\\xa0But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned I was around.\\n\\xa0They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don\\'t turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn\\'t in no danger of getting stole now.\\nBut I knowed better.\\n\\xa0I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs.\\n\\xa0I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better.\\n\\xa0I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking: \\xa0I knowed that very well.\\n\\xa0Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn\\'t a gone to sleep if I\\'d a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business.\\n\\xa0By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was going to happen.\\n\\xa0But nothing did.\\nSo I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn\\'t begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.\\nI crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring.\\n\\xa0So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t a sound anywheres.\\n\\xa0I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.\\n\\xa0The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms.\\nI passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn\\'t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn\\'t there.\\n\\xa0Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.\\n\\xa0I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin.\\n\\xa0The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man\\'s face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on.\\n\\xa0I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.\\nThe person coming was Mary Jane.\\n\\xa0She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn\\'t hear her, and her back was to me.\\n\\xa0I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I\\'d make sure them watchers hadn\\'t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right.\\n\\xa0They hadn\\'t stirred.\\nI slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it.\\n\\xa0Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain\\'t the thing that\\'s going to happen; the thing that\\'s going to happen is, the money \\'ll be found when they come to screw on the lid.\\n\\xa0Then the king \\'ll get it again, and it \\'ll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him.\\nOf course I _wanted_ to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn\\'t try it.\\n\\xa0Every minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I might get catched catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn\\'t hired me to take care of.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.\\nWhen I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the watchers was gone.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe.\\n\\xa0I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn\\'t tell.\\nTowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.\\n\\xa0I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn\\'t go to look in under it, with folks around.\\nThen the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man\\'s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church.\\nWhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat.\\n\\xa0He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands.\\n\\xa0Then he took his place over against the wall.\\nHe was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn\\'t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.\\nThey had borrowed a melodeum a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion.\\n\\xa0Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait you couldn\\'t hear yourself think.\\n\\xa0It was right down awkward, and nobody didn\\'t seem to know what to do.\\n\\xa0But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, \"Don\\'t you worry just depend on me.\"\\n\\xa0Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people\\'s heads.\\n\\xa0So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar.\\n\\xa0Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off.\\n\\xa0In a minute or two here comes this undertaker\\'s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people\\'s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \"_He had a rat_.\"\\n\\xa0Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place.\\n\\xa0You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know.\\n\\xa0A little thing like that don\\'t cost nothing, and it\\'s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked.\\n\\xa0There warn\\'t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was.\\nWell, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver.\\n\\xa0I was in a sweat then, and watched him pretty keen.\\nBut he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.\\n\\xa0So there I was!\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t know whether the money was in there or not.\\n\\xa0So, says I, s\\'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?\\nnow how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not?\\nS\\'pose she dug him up and didn\\'t find nothing, what would she think of me?\\nBlame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I\\'d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing\\'s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I\\'ve worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I\\'d just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business!\\nThey buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again I couldn\\'t help it, and I couldn\\'t rest easy.\\n\\xa0But nothing come of it; the faces didn\\'t tell me nothing.\\nThe king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.\\n\\xa0He was very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn\\'t be done.\\n\\xa0And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.\\n\\xa0Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn\\'t see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune.\\nWell, blamed if the king didn\\'t bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off sale two days after the funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.\\nSo the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls\\' joy got the first jolt.\\n\\xa0A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans.\\n\\xa0I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.\\n\\xa0The girls said they hadn\\'t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town.\\n\\xa0I can\\'t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other\\'s necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn\\'t a stood it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn\\'t knowed the sale warn\\'t no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.\\nThe thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way.\\n\\xa0It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy.\\nNext day was auction day.\\n\\xa0About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look that there was trouble.\\n\\xa0The king says:  \"Was you in my room night before last?\"\\n\"No, your majest.\"\\nwhich was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang warn\\'t around.\\n\"Was you in there yisterday er last night?\"\\n\"No, your majesty.\"\\n\"Honor bright, now no lies.\"\\n\"Honor bright, your majesty, I\\'m telling you the truth.\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you.\"\\nThe duke says:  \"Have you seen anybody else go in there?\"\\n\"No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.\"\\n\"Stop and think.\"\\nI studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:  \"Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.\"\\nBoth of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn\\'t ever expected it, and then like they _had_.\\n\\xa0Then the duke says:  \"What, all of them?\"\\n\"No leastways, not all at once that is, I don\\'t think I ever see them all come _out_ at once but just one time.\"\\n\"Hello!\\n\\xa0When was that?\"\\n\"It was the day we had the funeral.\\n\\xa0In the morning.\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t early, because I overslept.\\n\\xa0I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them.\"\\n\"Well, go on, _go_ on!\\n\\xa0What did they do?\\n\\xa0How\\'d they act?\"\\n\"They didn\\'t do nothing.\\n\\xa0And they didn\\'t act anyway much, as fur as I see.\\nThey tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they\\'d shoved in there to do up your majesty\\'s room, or something, s\\'posing you was up; and found you _warn\\'t_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn\\'t already waked you up.\"\\n\"Great guns, _this_ is a go.\"\\nsays the king; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly.\\n\\xa0They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says:  \"It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.\\n\\xa0They let on to be _sorry_ they was going out of this region!\\n\\xa0And I believed they _was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t ever tell _me_ any more that a nigger ain\\'t got any histrionic talent.\\n\\xa0Why, the way they played that thing it would fool _anybody_.\\n\\xa0In my opinion, there\\'s a fortune in \\'em.\\n\\xa0If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn\\'t want a better lay-out than that and here we\\'ve gone and sold \\'em for a song.\\n\\xa0Yes, and ain\\'t privileged to sing the song yet.\\n\\xa0Say, where _is_ that song that draft?\"\\n\"In the bank for to be collected.\\n\\xa0Where _would_ it be?\"\\n\"Well, _that\\'s_ all right then, thank goodness.\"\\nSays I, kind of timid-like:  \"Is something gone wrong?\"\\nThe king whirls on me and rips out:  \"None o\\' your business!\\n\\xa0You keep your head shet, and mind y\\'r own affairs if you got any.\\n\\xa0Long as you\\'re in this town don\\'t you forgit _that_ you hear?\"\\n\\xa0Then he says to the duke, \"We got to jest swaller it and say noth\\'n\\': \\xa0mum\\'s the word for _us_.\"\\nAs they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says:  \"Quick sales _and_ small profits!\\n\\xa0It\\'s a good business yes.\"\\nThe king snarls around on him and says:  \"I was trying to do for the best in sellin\\' \\'em out so quick.\\n\\xa0If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin\\' considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more\\'n it\\'s yourn?\"\\n\"Well, _they\\'d_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn\\'t_ if I could a got my advice listened to.\"\\nThe king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around and lit into _me_ again.\\n\\xa0He give me down the banks for not coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up.\\n\\xa0And then waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he\\'d be blamed if he\\'d ever do it again.\\n\\xa0So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I\\'d worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn\\'t done the niggers no harm by it.\\nBY and by it was getting-up time.\\n\\xa0So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls\\' room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she\\'d been packing things in it getting ready to go to England.\\n\\xa0But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying.\\n\\xa0I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.\\n\\xa0I went in there and says:  \"Miss Mary Jane, you can\\'t a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can\\'t most always.\\n\\xa0Tell me about it.\"\\nSo she done it.\\n\\xa0And it was the niggers I just expected it.\\n\\xa0She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn\\'t know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn\\'t ever going to see each other no more and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:  \"Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain\\'t _ever_ going to see each other any more.\"\\n\"But they _will_ and inside of two weeks and I _know_ it.\"\\nsays I.\\nLaws, it was out before I could think!\\n\\xa0And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it _again_, say it _again_!\\nI see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place.\\nI asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that\\'s had a tooth pulled out.\\n\\xa0So I went to studying it out.\\n\\xa0I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain\\'t had no experience, and can\\'t say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here\\'s a case where I\\'m blest if it don\\'t look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.\\n\\xa0I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it\\'s so kind of strange and unregular.\\nI never see nothing like it.\\n\\xa0Well, I says to myself at last, I\\'m a-going to chance it; I\\'ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you\\'ll go to.\\nThen I says:  \"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days?\"\\n\"Yes; Mr.\\nLothrop\\'s.\\n\\xa0Why?\"\\n\"Never mind why yet.\\n\\xa0If I\\'ll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks here in this house and _prove_ how I know it will you go to Mr.\\nLothrop\\'s and stay four days?\"\\n\"Four days.\"\\nshe says; \"I\\'ll stay a year.\"\\n\"All right.\"\\nI says, \"I don\\'t want nothing more out of _you_ than just your word I druther have it than another man\\'s kiss-the-Bible.\"\\n\\xa0She smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, \"If you don\\'t mind it, I\\'ll shut the door and bolt it.\"\\nThen I come back and set down again, and says:  \"Don\\'t you holler.\\n\\xa0Just set still and take it like a man.\\n\\xa0I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it\\'s a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain\\'t no help for it.\\n\\xa0These uncles of yourn ain\\'t no uncles at all; they\\'re a couple of frauds regular dead-beats.\\n\\xa0There, now we\\'re over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling easy.\"\\nIt jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself on to the king\\'s breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says:  \"The brute!\\n\\xa0Come, don\\'t waste a minute not a _second_ we\\'ll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river.\"\\nSays I:  \"Cert\\'nly.\\n\\xa0But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr.\\nLothrop\\'s, or.\"\\n\"Oh.\"\\nshe says, \"what am I _thinking_ about.\"\\nshe says, and set right down again.\\n\\xa0\"Don\\'t mind what I said please don\\'t you _won\\'t,_ now, _will_ you?\"\\nLaying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first.\\n\\xa0\"I never thought, I was so stirred up.\"\\nshe says; \"now go on, and I won\\'t do so any more.\\n\\xa0You tell me what to do, and whatever you say I\\'ll do it.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nI says, \"it\\'s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I\\'m fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I\\'d be all right; but there\\'d be another person that you don\\'t know about who\\'d be in big trouble.\\n\\xa0Well, we got to save _him_, hain\\'t we?\\n\\xa0Of course.\\n\\xa0Well, then, we won\\'t blow on them.\"\\nSaying them words put a good idea in my head.\\n\\xa0I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.\\nBut I didn\\'t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn\\'t want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night.\\n\\xa0I says:  \"Miss Mary Jane, I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do, and you won\\'t have to stay at Mr.\\nLothrop\\'s so long, nuther.\\n\\xa0How fur is it?\"\\n\"A little short of four miles right out in the country, back here.\"\\n\"Well, that \\'ll answer.\\n\\xa0Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again tell them you\\'ve thought of something.\\n\\xa0If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don\\'t turn up wait _till_ eleven, and _then_ if I don\\'t turn up it means I\\'m gone, and out of the way, and safe.\\nThen you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.\"\\n\"Good.\"\\nshe says, \"I\\'ll do it.\"\\n\"And if it just happens so that I don\\'t get away, but get took up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.\"\\n\"Stand by you!\\nindeed I will.\\n\\xa0They sha\\'n\\'t touch a hair of your head.\"\\nshe says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it, too.\\n\"If I get away I sha\\'n\\'t be here.\"\\nI says, \"to prove these rapscallions ain\\'t your uncles, and I couldn\\'t do it if I _was_ here.\\n\\xa0I could swear they was beats and bummers, that\\'s all, though that\\'s worth something.\\nWell, there\\'s others can do that better than what I can, and they\\'re people that ain\\'t going to be doubted as quick as I\\'d be.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll tell you how to find them.\\n\\xa0Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.\\n\\xa0There \\'Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.\\' \\xa0Put it away, and don\\'t lose it.\\n\\xa0When the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they\\'ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses why, you\\'ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.\\n\\xa0And they\\'ll come a-biling, too.\"\\nI judged we had got everything fixed about right now.\\n\\xa0So I says:  \"Just let the auction go right along, and don\\'t worry.\\n\\xa0Nobody don\\'t have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain\\'t going out of this till they get that money; and the way we\\'ve fixed it the sale ain\\'t going to count, and they ain\\'t going to get no money.\\n\\xa0It\\'s just like the way it was with the niggers it warn\\'t no sale, and the niggers will be back before long.\\n\\xa0Why, they can\\'t collect the money for the _niggers_ yet they\\'re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nshe says, \"I\\'ll run down to breakfast now, and then I\\'ll start straight for Mr.\\nLothrop\\'s.\"\\n\"\\'Deed, _that_ ain\\'t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane.\"\\nI says, \"by no manner of means; go _before_ breakfast.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?\"\\n\"Well, I never thought and come to think, I don\\'t know.\\n\\xa0What was it?\"\\n\"Why, it\\'s because you ain\\'t one of these leather-face people.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t want no better book than what your face is.\\n\\xa0A body can set down and read it off like coarse print.\\n\\xa0Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never.\"\\n\"There, there, don\\'t!\\n\\xa0Yes, I\\'ll go before breakfast I\\'ll be glad to.\\nAnd leave my sisters with them?\"\\n\"Yes; never mind about them.\\n\\xa0They\\'ve got to stand it yet a while.\\n\\xa0They might suspicion something if all of you was to go.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.\\n\\xa0No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I\\'ll fix it with all of them.\\nI\\'ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you\\'ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you\\'ll be back to-night or early in the morning.\"\\n\"Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won\\'t have my love given to them.\"\\n\"Well, then, it sha\\'n\\'t be.\"\\n\\xa0It was well enough to tell _her_ so no harm in it.\\n\\xa0It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it\\'s the little things that smooths people\\'s roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn\\'t cost nothing.\\n\\xa0Then I says: \\xa0\"There\\'s one more thing that bag of money.\"\\n\"Well, they\\'ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think _how_ they got it.\"\\n\"No, you\\'re out, there.\\n\\xa0They hain\\'t got it.\"\\n\"Why, who\\'s got it?\"\\n\"I wish I knowed, but I don\\'t.\\n\\xa0I _had_ it, because I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I\\'m afraid it ain\\'t there no more.\\n\\xa0I\\'m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I\\'m just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.\\n\\xa0I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run and it warn\\'t a good place.\"\\n\"Oh, stop blaming yourself it\\'s too bad to do it, and I won\\'t allow it you couldn\\'t help it; it wasn\\'t your fault.\\n\\xa0Where did you hide it?\"\\nI didn\\'t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn\\'t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.\\n\\xa0So for a minute I didn\\'t say nothing; then I says:  \"I\\'d ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don\\'t mind letting me off; but I\\'ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr.\\nLothrop\\'s, if you want to.\\n\\xa0Do you reckon that \\'ll do?\"\\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\nSo I wrote: \\xa0\"I put it in the coffin.\\n\\xa0It was in there when you was crying there, away in the night.\\n\\xa0I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.\"\\nIt made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says:  \"_Good_-bye.\\n\\xa0I\\'m going to do everything just as you\\'ve told me; and if I don\\'t ever see you again, I sha\\'n\\'t ever forget you and I\\'ll think of you a many and a many a time, and I\\'ll _pray_ for you, too.\"\\nand she was gone.\\nPray for me!\\n\\xa0I reckoned if she knowed me she\\'d take a job that was more nearer her size.\\n\\xa0But I bet she done it, just the same she was just that kind.\\n\\xa0She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion there warn\\'t no back-down to her, I judge.\\n\\xa0You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand.\\n\\xa0It sounds like flattery, but it ain\\'t no flattery.\\n\\xa0And when it comes to beauty and goodness, too she lays over them all.\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain\\'t ever seen her since, but I reckon I\\'ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I\\'d a thought it would do any good for me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn\\'t a done it or bust.\\nWell, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her go.\\n\\xa0When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:  \"What\\'s the name of them people over on t\\'other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes?\"\\nThey says:  \"There\\'s several; but it\\'s the Proctors, mainly.\"\\n\"That\\'s the name.\"\\nI says; \"I most forgot it.\\n\\xa0Well, Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she\\'s gone over there in a dreadful hurry one of them\\'s sick.\"\\n\"Which one?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it\\'s.\"\\n\"Sakes alive, I hope it ain\\'t _Hanner_?\"\\n\"I\\'m sorry to say it.\"\\nI says, \"but Hanner\\'s the very one.\"\\n\"My goodness, and she so well only last week!\\n\\xa0Is she took bad?\"\\n\"It ain\\'t no name for it.\\n\\xa0They set up with her all night, Miss Mary Jane said, and they don\\'t think she\\'ll last many hours.\"\\n\"Only think of that, now!\\n\\xa0What\\'s the matter with her?\"\\nI couldn\\'t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:  \"Mumps.\"\\n\"Mumps your granny!\\n\\xa0They don\\'t set up with people that\\'s got the mumps.\"\\n\"They don\\'t, don\\'t they?\\n\\xa0You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.\\n\\xa0These mumps is different.\\n\\xa0It\\'s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.\"\\n\"How\\'s it a new kind?\"\\n\"Because it\\'s mixed up with other things.\"\\n\"What other things?\"\\n\"Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don\\'t know what all.\"\\n\"My land!\\n\\xa0And they call it the _mumps_?\"\\n\"That\\'s what Miss Mary Jane said.\"\\n\"Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?\"\\n\"Why, because it _is_ the mumps.\\n\\xa0That\\'s what it starts with.\"\\n\"Well, ther\\' ain\\'t no sense in it.\\n\\xa0A body might stump his toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull up and say, \\'Why, he stumped his _toe_.\\' \\xa0Would ther\\' be any sense in that?\\n_No_.\\n\\xa0And ther\\' ain\\'t no sense in _this_, nuther.\\n\\xa0Is it ketching?\"\\n\"Is it _ketching_?\\n\\xa0Why, how you talk.\\n\\xa0Is a _harrow_ catching in the dark?\\nIf you don\\'t hitch on to one tooth, you\\'re bound to on another, ain\\'t you?\\nAnd you can\\'t get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you?\\n\\xa0Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say and it ain\\'t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good.\"\\n\"Well, it\\'s awful, I think.\"\\nsays the hare-lip.\\n\\xa0\"I\\'ll go to Uncle Harvey and.\"\\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\nI says, \"I _would_.\\n\\xa0Of _course_ I would.\\n\\xa0I wouldn\\'t lose no time.\"\\n\"Well, why wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\"Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.\\n\\xa0Hain\\'t your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can?\\n\\xa0And do you reckon they\\'d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves?\\n\\xa0_you_ know they\\'ll wait for you.\\n\\xa0So fur, so good.\\nYour uncle Harvey\\'s a preacher, ain\\'t he?\\n\\xa0Very well, then; is a _preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk?\\nis he going to deceive a _ship clerk?_ so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?\\n\\xa0Now _you_ know he ain\\'t.\\n\\xa0What _will_ he do, then?\\n\\xa0Why, he\\'ll say, \\'It\\'s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it\\'s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she\\'s got it.\\' \\xa0But never mind, if you think it\\'s best to tell your uncle Harvey.\"\\n\"Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane\\'s got it or not?\\n\\xa0Why, you talk like a muggins.\"\\n\"Well, anyway, maybe you\\'d better tell some of the neighbors.\"\\n\"Listen at that, now.\\n\\xa0You do beat all for natural stupidness.\\n\\xa0Can\\'t you _see_ that _they\\'d_ go and tell?\\n\\xa0Ther\\' ain\\'t no way but just to not tell anybody at _all_.\"\\n\"Well, maybe you\\'re right yes, I judge you _are_ right.\"\\n\"But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she\\'s gone out a while, anyway, so he won\\'t be uneasy about her?\"\\n\"Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.\\n\\xa0She says, \\'Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I\\'ve run over the river to see Mr.\\' Mr.\\nwhat _is_ the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of?\\nI mean the one that.\"\\n\"Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain\\'t it?\"\\n\"Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can\\'t ever seem to remember them, half the time, somehow.\\n\\xa0Yes, she said, say she has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else; and she\\'s going to stick to them till they say they\\'ll come, and then, if she ain\\'t too tired, she\\'s coming home; and if she is, she\\'ll be home in the morning anyway.\\n\\xa0She said, don\\'t say nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps which \\'ll be perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.\"\\n\"All right.\"\\nthey said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.\\nEverything was all right now.\\n\\xa0The girls wouldn\\'t say nothing because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson.\\n\\xa0I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn\\'t a done it no neater himself.\\n\\xa0Of course he would a throwed more style into it, but I can\\'t do that very handy, not being brung up to it.\\nWell, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.\\nBut by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.\\n\\xa0So they\\'d got to work that off I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow _everything_.\\n\\xa0Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:  \"_Here\\'s_ your opposition line!\\nhere\\'s your two sets o\\' heirs to old Peter Wilks and you pays your money and you takes your choice.\"\\nTHEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.\\n\\xa0And, my souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.\\n\\xa0But I didn\\'t see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any.\\n\\xa0I reckoned they\\'d turn pale.\\n\\xa0But no, nary a pale did _they_ turn.\\nThe duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that\\'s googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world.\\n\\xa0Oh, he done it admirable.\\n\\xa0Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side.\\n\\xa0That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an Englishman not the king\\'s way, though the king\\'s _was_ pretty good for an imitation.\\n\\xa0I can\\'t give the old gent\\'s words, nor I can\\'t imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:  \"This is a surprise to me which I wasn\\'t looking for; and I\\'ll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain\\'t very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he\\'s broke his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake.\\n\\xa0I am Peter Wilks\\' brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can\\'t hear nor speak and can\\'t even make signs to amount to much, now\\'t he\\'s only got one hand to work them with.\\n\\xa0We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it.\\nBut up till then I won\\'t say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait.\"\\nSo him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers out:  \"Broke his arm _very_ likely, _ain\\'t_ it?\\nand very convenient, too, for a fraud that\\'s got to make signs, and ain\\'t learnt how.\\n\\xa0Lost their baggage!\\nThat\\'s _mighty_ good!\\nand mighty ingenious under the _circumstances_.\"\\nSo he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or maybe half a dozen.\\n\\xa0One of these was that doctor; another one was a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king now.\\nAnd when the king got done this husky up and says:  \"Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when\\'d you come to this town?\"\\n\"The day before the funeral, friend.\"\\nsays the king.\\n\"But what time o\\' day?\"\\n\"In the evenin\\' \\'bout an hour er two before sundown.\"\\n\"_How\\'d_ you come?\"\\n\"I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.\"\\n\"Well, then, how\\'d you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_\\' in a canoe?\"\\n\"I warn\\'t up at the Pint in the mornin\\'.\"\\n\"It\\'s a lie.\"\\nSeveral of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher.\\n\"Preacher be hanged, he\\'s a fraud and a liar.\\n\\xa0He was up at the Pint that mornin\\'.\\n\\xa0I live up there, don\\'t I?\\n\\xa0Well, I was up there, and he was up there.\\n\\xa0I see him there.\\n\\xa0He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy.\"\\nThe doctor he up and says:  \"Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?\"\\n\"I reckon I would, but I don\\'t know.\\n\\xa0Why, yonder he is, now.\\n\\xa0I know him perfectly easy.\"\\nIt was me he pointed at.\\n\\xa0The doctor says:  \"Neighbors, I don\\'t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if _these_ two ain\\'t frauds, I am an idiot, that\\'s all.\\n\\xa0I think it\\'s our duty to see that they don\\'t get away from here till we\\'ve looked into this thing.\\nCome along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.\\n\\xa0We\\'ll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t\\'other couple, and I reckon we\\'ll find out _something_ before we get through.\"\\nIt was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king\\'s friends; so we all started.\\n\\xa0It was about sundown.\\n\\xa0The doctor he led me along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.\\nWe all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and fetched in the new couple.\\n\\xa0First, the doctor says:  \"I don\\'t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they\\'re frauds, and they may have complices that we don\\'t know nothing about.\\n\\xa0If they have, won\\'t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left?\\n\\xa0It ain\\'t unlikely.\\n\\xa0If these men ain\\'t frauds, they won\\'t object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they\\'re all right ain\\'t that so?\"\\nEverybody agreed to that.\\n\\xa0So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart.\\n\\xa0But the king he only looked sorrowful, and says:  \"Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain\\'t got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o\\' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain\\'t there; you k\\'n send and see, if you want to.\"\\n\"Where is it, then?\"\\n\"Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o\\' the straw tick o\\' my bed, not wishin\\' to bank it for the few days we\\'d be here, and considerin\\' the bed a safe place, we not bein\\' used to niggers, and suppos\\'n\\' \\'em honest, like servants in England.\\n\\xa0The niggers stole it the very next mornin\\' after I had went down stairs; and when I sold \\'em I hadn\\'t missed the money yit, so they got clean away with it.\\n\\xa0My servant here k\\'n tell you \\'bout it, gentlemen.\"\\nThe doctor and several said \"Shucks.\"\\nand I see nobody didn\\'t altogether believe him.\\n\\xa0One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.\\n\\xa0I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.\\n\\xa0That was all they asked me.\\n\\xa0Then the doctor whirls on me and says:  \"Are _you_ English, too?\"\\nI says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, \"Stuff.\"\\nWell, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about supper, nor ever seemed to think about it and so they kept it up, and kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.\\n\\xa0They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his\\'n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t\\'other one lies.\\n\\xa0And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed.\\n\\xa0The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side.\\n\\xa0I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn\\'t get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:  \"Set down, my boy; I wouldn\\'t strain myself if I was you.\\n\\xa0I reckon you ain\\'t used to lying, it don\\'t seem to come handy; what you want is practice.\\n\\xa0You do it pretty awkward.\"\\nI didn\\'t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off, anyway.\\nThe doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:  \"If you\\'d been in town at first, Levi Bell.\"\\nThe king broke in and reached out his hand, and says:  \"Why, is this my poor dead brother\\'s old friend that he\\'s wrote so often about?\"\\nThe lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:  \"That \\'ll fix it.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll take the order and send it, along with your brother\\'s, and then they\\'ll know it\\'s all right.\"\\nSo they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke and then for the first time the duke looked sick.\\n\\xa0But he took the pen and wrote.\\n\\xa0So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:  \"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\"\\nThe old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn\\'t read it.\\n\\xa0The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says:  \"Well, it beats _me.\"\\nand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man\\'s writing, and then _them_ again; and then says: \\xa0\"These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here\\'s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn\\'t write the.\"\\n(the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \"and here\\'s _this_ old gentleman\\'s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn\\'t write them fact is, the scratches he makes ain\\'t properly _writing_ at all.\\n\\xa0Now, here\\'s some letters from.\"\\nThe new old gentleman says:  \"If you please, let me explain.\\n\\xa0Nobody can read my hand but my brother there so he copies for me.\\n\\xa0It\\'s _his_ hand you\\'ve got there, not mine.\"\\n\"_Well_.\"\\nsays the lawyer, \"this _is_ a state of things.\\n\\xa0I\\'ve got some of William\\'s letters, too; so if you\\'ll get him to write a line or so we can com.\"\\n\"He _can\\'t_ write with his left hand.\"\\nsays the old gentleman.\\n\\xa0\"If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too.\\n\\xa0Look at both, please they\\'re by the same hand.\"\\nThe lawyer done it, and says:  \"I believe it\\'s so and if it ain\\'t so, there\\'s a heap stronger resemblance than I\\'d noticed before, anyway.\\n\\xa0Well, well, well!\\n\\xa0I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it\\'s gone to grass, partly.\\n\\xa0But anyway, one thing is proved _these_ two ain\\'t either of \\'em Wilkse.\"\\nand he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\\nWell, what do you think?\\n\\xa0That muleheaded old fool wouldn\\'t give in _then_!\\nIndeed he wouldn\\'t.\\n\\xa0Said it warn\\'t no fair test.\\n\\xa0Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn\\'t tried to write _he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper.\\n\\xa0And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:  \"I\\'ve thought of something.\\n\\xa0Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsays somebody, \"me and Ab Turner done it.\\n\\xa0We\\'re both here.\"\\nThen the old man turns towards the king, and says:  \"Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\"\\nBlamed if the king didn\\'t have to brace up mighty quick, or he\\'d a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\\n\\xa0He whitened a little; he couldn\\'t help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.\\n\\xa0Says I to myself, _now_ he\\'ll throw up the sponge there ain\\'t no more use.\\n\\xa0Well, did he?\\n\\xa0A body can\\'t hardly believe it, but he didn\\'t.\\n\\xa0I reckon he thought he\\'d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they\\'d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\\n\\xa0Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:  \"Mf!\\n\\xa0It\\'s a _very_ tough question, _ain\\'t_ it!\\n\\xa0_yes_, sir, I k\\'n tell you what\\'s tattooed on his breast.\\n\\xa0It\\'s jest a small, thin, blue arrow that\\'s what it is; and if you don\\'t look clost, you can\\'t see it.\\n\\xa0_now_ what do you say hey?\"\\nWell, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek.\\nThe new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his eye lights up like he judged he\\'d got the king _this_ time, and says:  \"There you\\'ve heard what he said!\\n\\xa0Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks\\' breast?\"\\nBoth of them spoke up and says:  \"We didn\\'t see no such mark.\"\\n\"Good.\"\\nsays the old gentleman.\\n\\xa0\"Now, what you _did_ see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: \\xa0P B .\"\\nand he marked them that way on a piece of paper.\\n\\xa0\"Come, ain\\'t that what you saw?\"\\nBoth of them spoke up again, and says:  \"No, we _didn\\'t_.\\n\\xa0We never seen any marks at all.\"\\nWell, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:  \"The whole _bilin_\\' of \\'m \\'s frauds!\\n\\xa0Le\\'s duck \\'em!\\nle\\'s drown \\'em!\\nle\\'s ride \\'em on a rail.\"\\nand everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling powwow.\\n\\xa0But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says:  \"Gentlemen gentle_men!_ \\xa0Hear me just a word just a _single_ word if you _please_!\\n\\xa0There\\'s one way yet let\\'s go and dig up the corpse and look.\"\\nThat took them.\\n\"Hooray.\"\\nthey all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out:  \"Hold on, hold on!\\n\\xa0Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch _them_ along, too.\"\\n\"We\\'ll do it.\"\\nthey all shouted; \"and if we don\\'t find them marks we\\'ll lynch the whole gang.\"\\nI _was_ scared, now, I tell you.\\n\\xa0But there warn\\'t no getting away, you know.\\nThey gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening.\\nAs we went by our house I wished I hadn\\'t sent Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip her the wink she\\'d light out and save me, and blow on our dead-beats.\\nWell, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves.\\nThis was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.\\n\\xa0If they didn\\'t find them   I couldn\\'t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn\\'t think about nothing else.\\n\\xa0It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist Hines and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.\\n\\xa0He dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\\nWhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow.\\n\\xa0And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn\\'t thought to fetch a lantern.\\n\\xa0But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow one.\\nSo they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn\\'t see nothing at all.\\nAt last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful.\\n\\xa0Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.\\nAll of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out:  \"By the living jingo, here\\'s the bag of gold on his breast.\"\\nHines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain\\'t nobody can tell.\\nI had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew leastways, I had it all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!\\nWhen I struck the town I see there warn\\'t nobody out in the storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it.\\nNo light there; the house all dark which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn\\'t know why.\\n\\xa0But at last, just as I was sailing by, _flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane\\'s window!\\nand my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn\\'t ever going to be before me no more in this world.\\nShe _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.\\nThe minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn\\'t chained I snatched it and shoved.\\nIt was a canoe, and warn\\'t fastened with nothing but a rope.\\n\\xa0The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn\\'t lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it.\\n\\xa0But I didn\\'t.\\n\\xa0As I sprung aboard I sung out:  \"Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!\\n\\xa0Glory be to goodness, we\\'re shut of them.\"\\nJim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me.\\n\\xa0But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says:  \"Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!\\n\\xa0Cut loose and let her slide.\"\\nSo in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_ seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and nobody to bother us.\\n\\xa0I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my heels a few times I couldn\\'t help it; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here they come!\\nand just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum!\\n\\xa0It was the king and the duke.\\nSo I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all I could do to keep from crying.\\nWHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and says:  \"Tryin\\' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!\\n\\xa0Tired of our company, hey?\"\\nI says:  \"No, your majesty, we warn\\'t _please_ don\\'t, your majesty.\"\\n\"Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I\\'ll shake the insides out o\\' you.\"\\n\"Honest, I\\'ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.\\n\\xa0The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whispers, \\'Heel it now, or they\\'ll hang ye, sure!\\' and I lit out.\\n\\xa0It didn\\'t seem no good for _me_ to stay I couldn\\'t do nothing, and I didn\\'t want to be hung if I could get away.\\n\\xa0So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they\\'d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn\\'t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn\\'t.\"\\nJim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, \"Oh, yes, it\\'s _mighty_ likely.\"\\nand shook me up again, and said he reckoned he\\'d drownd me.\\n\\xa0But the duke says:  \"Leggo the boy, you old idiot!\\n\\xa0Would _you_ a done any different?\\n\\xa0Did you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose?\\n\\xa0I don\\'t remember it.\"\\nSo the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it.\\nBut the duke says:  \"You better a blame\\' sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you\\'re the one that\\'s entitled to it most.\\n\\xa0You hain\\'t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark.\\n\\xa0That _was_ bright it was right down bully; and it was the thing that saved us.\\n\\xa0For if it hadn\\'t been for that they\\'d a jailed us till them Englishmen\\'s baggage come and then the penitentiary, you bet!\\nBut that trick took \\'em to the graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn\\'t let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we\\'d a slept in our cravats to-night cravats warranted to _wear_, too longer than _we\\'d_ need \\'em.\"\\nThey was still a minute thinking; then the king says, kind of absent-minded like:  \"Mf!\\n\\xa0And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it.\"\\nThat made me squirm!\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsays the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, \"_we_ did.\"\\nAfter about a half a minute the king drawls out:  \"Leastways, I did.\"\\nThe duke says, the same way:  \"On the contrary, I did.\"\\nThe king kind of ruffles up, and says:  \"Looky here, Bilgewater, what\\'r you referrin\\' to?\"\\nThe duke says, pretty brisk:  \"When it comes to that, maybe you\\'ll let me ask, what was _you_ referring to?\"\\n\"Shucks.\"\\nsays the king, very sarcastic; \"but I don\\'t know maybe you was asleep, and didn\\'t know what you was about.\"\\nThe duke bristles up now, and says:  \"Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame\\' fool?\\nDon\\'t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?\"\\n\"_Yes_, sir!\\n\\xa0I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself.\"\\n\"It\\'s a lie.\"\\nand the duke went for him.\\n\\xa0The king sings out:  \"Take y\\'r hands off!\\nleggo my throat!\\nI take it all back.\"\\nThe duke says:  \"Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it up, and have it all to yourself.\"\\n\"Wait jest a minute, duke answer me this one question, honest and fair; if you didn\\'t put the money there, say it, and I\\'ll b\\'lieve you, and take back everything I said.\"\\n\"You old scoundrel, I didn\\'t, and you know I didn\\'t.\\n\\xa0There, now.\"\\n\"Well, then, I b\\'lieve you.\\n\\xa0But answer me only jest this one more now _don\\'t_ git mad; didn\\'t you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?\"\\nThe duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:  \"Well, I don\\'t care if I _did_, I didn\\'t _do_ it, anyway.\\n\\xa0But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.\"\\n\"I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that\\'s honest.\\n\\xa0I won\\'t say I warn\\'t goin\\' to do it, because I _was_; but you I mean somebody got in ahead o\\' me.\"\\n\"It\\'s a lie!\\n\\xa0You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or.\"\\nThe king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:  \"\\'Nough!\\nI _own up!.\"\\nI was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before.\\n\\xa0So the duke took his hands off and says:  \"If you ever deny it again I\\'ll drown you.\\n\\xa0It\\'s _well_ for you to set there and blubber like a baby it\\'s fitten for you, after the way you\\'ve acted.\\nI never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father.\\n\\xa0You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for \\'em.\\n\\xa0It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_ that rubbage.\\n\\xa0Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit you wanted to get what money I\\'d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it _all_.\"\\nThe king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:  \"Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn\\'t me.\"\\n\"Dry up!\\n\\xa0I don\\'t want to hear no more out of you.\"\\nsays the duke.\\n\\xa0\"And _now_ you see what you GOT by it.\\n\\xa0They\\'ve got all their own money back, and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_.\\n\\xa0G\\'long to bed, and don\\'t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long \\'s _you_ live.\"\\nSo the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other\\'s arms.\\n\\xa0They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn\\'t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again.\\n\\xa0That made me feel easy and satisfied.\\n\\xa0Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.\\nWE dasn\\'t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river.\\n\\xa0We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home.\\n\\xa0We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.\\n\\xa0It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal.\\n\\xa0So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.\\nFirst they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn\\'t make enough for them both to get drunk on.\\n\\xa0Then in another village they started a dancing-school; but they didn\\'t know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town.\\n\\xa0Another time they tried to go at yellocution; but they didn\\'t yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.\\n\\xa0They tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn\\'t seem to have no luck.\\n\\xa0So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\\nAnd at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.\\nJim and me got uneasy.\\n\\xa0We didn\\'t like the look of it.\\n\\xa0We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.\\n\\xa0We turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody\\'s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money business, or something.\\nSo then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn\\'t have nothing in the world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind.\\nWell, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet.\\n(\"House to rob, you _mean_.\"\\nsays I to myself; \"and when you get through robbing it you\\'ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft and you\\'ll have to take it out in wondering.\") And he said if he warn\\'t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.\\nSo we stayed where we was.\\n\\xa0The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way.\\n\\xa0He scolded us for everything, and we couldn\\'t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.\\nSomething was a-brewing, sure.\\n\\xa0I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway and maybe a chance for _the_ change on top of it.\\n\\xa0So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn\\'t walk, and couldn\\'t do nothing to them.\\n\\xa0The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again.\\n\\xa0I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:  \"Set her loose, Jim!\\nwe\\'re all right now.\"\\nBut there warn\\'t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.\\n\\xa0Jim was gone!\\n\\xa0I set up a shout and then another and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn\\'t no use old Jim was gone.\\n\\xa0Then I set down and cried; I couldn\\'t help it.\\nBut I couldn\\'t set still long.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him if he\\'d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:  \"Yes.\"\\n\"Whereabouts?\"\\nsays I.\\n\"Down to Silas Phelps\\' place, two mile below here.\\n\\xa0He\\'s a runaway nigger, and they\\'ve got him.\\n\\xa0Was you looking for him?\"\\n\"You bet I ain\\'t!\\n\\xa0I run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago, and he said if I hollered he\\'d cut my livers out and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it.\\n\\xa0Been there ever since; afeard to come out.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nhe says, \"you needn\\'t be afeard no more, becuz they\\'ve got him.\\nHe run off f\\'m down South, som\\'ers.\"\\n\"It\\'s a good job they got him.\"\\n\"Well, I _reckon_!\\n\\xa0There\\'s two hunderd dollars reward on him.\\n\\xa0It\\'s like picking up money out\\'n the road.\"\\n\"Yes, it is and I could a had it if I\\'d been big enough; I see him _first_.\\nWho nailed him?\"\\n\"It was an old fellow a stranger and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he\\'s got to go up the river and can\\'t wait.\\n\\xa0Think o\\' that, now!\\n\\xa0You bet _I\\'d_ wait, if it was seven year.\"\\n\"That\\'s me, every time.\"\\nsays I.\\n\\xa0\"But maybe his chance ain\\'t worth no more than that, if he\\'ll sell it so cheap.\\n\\xa0Maybe there\\'s something ain\\'t straight about it.\"\\n\"But it _is_, though straight as a string.\\n\\xa0I see the handbill myself.\\n\\xa0It tells all about him, to a dot paints him like a picture, and tells the plantation he\\'s frum, below Newr_leans_.\\n\\xa0No-sirree-_bob_, they ain\\'t no trouble \\'bout _that_ speculation, you bet you.\\n\\xa0Say, gimme a chaw tobacker, won\\'t ye?\"\\nI didn\\'t have none, so he left.\\n\\xa0I went to the raft, and set down in the wigwam to think.\\n\\xa0But I couldn\\'t come to nothing.\\n\\xa0I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn\\'t see no way out of the trouble.\\n\\xa0After all this long journey, and after all we\\'d done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars.\\nOnce I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he\\'d _got_ to be a slave, and so I\\'d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was.\\n\\xa0But I soon give up that notion for two things: she\\'d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she\\'d sell him straight down the river again; and if she didn\\'t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they\\'d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he\\'d feel ornery and disgraced.\\nAnd then think of _me_!\\n\\xa0It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I\\'d be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame.\\n\\xa0That\\'s just the way: \\xa0a person does a low-down thing, and then he don\\'t want to take no consequences of it.\\nThinks as long as he can hide it, it ain\\'t no disgrace.\\n\\xa0That was my fix exactly.\\nThe more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling.\\nAnd at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman\\'s nigger that hadn\\'t ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there\\'s One that\\'s always on the lookout, and ain\\'t a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.\\n\\xa0Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn\\'t so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, \"There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you\\'d a done it they\\'d a learnt you there that people that acts as I\\'d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.\"\\nIt made me shiver.\\n\\xa0And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn\\'t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.\\n\\xa0So I kneeled down.\\n\\xa0But the words wouldn\\'t come.\\n\\xa0Why wouldn\\'t they?\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t no use to try and hide it from Him.\\n\\xa0Nor from _me_, neither.\\n\\xa0I knowed very well why they wouldn\\'t come.\\n\\xa0It was because my heart warn\\'t right; it was because I warn\\'t square; it was because I was playing double.\\n\\xa0I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all.\\n\\xa0I was trying to make my mouth _say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to that nigger\\'s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.\\n\\xa0You can\\'t pray a lie I found that out.\\nSo I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn\\'t know what to do.\\nAt last I had an idea; and I says, I\\'ll go and write the letter and then see if I can pray.\\n\\xa0Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.\\n\\xa0So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:  Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr.\\nPhelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send.\\n_Huck Finn._  I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.\\n\\xa0But I didn\\'t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell.\\n\\xa0And went on thinking.\\n\\xa0And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: \\xa0in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.\\n\\xa0But somehow I couldn\\'t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind.\\n\\xa0I\\'d see him standing my watch on top of his\\'n, \\'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he\\'s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\\nIt was a close place.\\n\\xa0I took it up, and held it in my hand.\\n\\xa0I was a-trembling, because I\\'d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it.\\n\\xa0I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:  \"All right, then, I\\'ll _go_ to hel.\"\\nand tore it up.\\nIt was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.\\n\\xa0And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.\\n\\xa0I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn\\'t.\\n\\xa0And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\\nThen I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me.\\n\\xa0So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.\\n\\xa0I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.\\n\\xa0I landed below where I judged was Phelps\\'s place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\\nThen I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, \"Phelps\\'s Sawmill.\"\\nand when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn\\'t see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.\\n\\xa0But I didn\\'t mind, because I didn\\'t want to see nobody just yet I only wanted to get the lay of the land.\\nAccording to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below.\\n\\xa0So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town.\\nWell, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke.\\n\\xa0He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch three-night performance like that other time.\\n\\xa0They had the cheek, them frauds!\\n\\xa0I was right on him before I could shirk.\\n\\xa0He looked astonished, and says:  \"Hel-_lo_!\\n\\xa0Where\\'d _you_ come from?\"\\n\\xa0Then he says, kind of glad and eager, \"Where\\'s the raft?\\ngot her in a good place?\"\\nI says:  \"Why, that\\'s just what I was going to ask your grace.\"\\nThen he didn\\'t look so joyful, and says:  \"What was your idea for asking _me_?\"\\nhe says.\\n\"Well.\"\\nI says, \"when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can\\'t get him home for hours, till he\\'s soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.\\n\\xa0A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him.\\n\\xa0We didn\\'t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out.\\n\\xa0We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.\\n\\xa0When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, \\'They\\'ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they\\'ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I\\'ve got in the world, and now I\\'m in a strange country, and ain\\'t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;\\' so I set down and cried.\\n\\xa0I slept in the woods all night.\\n\\xa0But what _did_ become of the raft, then?\\nand Jim poor Jim.\"\\n\"Blamed if I know that is, what\\'s become of the raft.\\n\\xa0That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he\\'d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, \\'That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river..\"\\n\"I wouldn\\'t shake my _nigger_, would I?\\nthe only nigger I had in the world, and the only property.\"\\n\"We never thought of that.\\n\\xa0Fact is, I reckon we\\'d come to consider him _our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so goodness knows we had trouble enough for him.\\n\\xa0So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there warn\\'t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake.\\nAnd I\\'ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.\\n\\xa0Where\\'s that ten cents?\\nGive it here.\"\\nI had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I had, and I hadn\\'t had nothing to eat since yesterday.\\n\\xa0He never said nothing.\\n\\xa0The next minute he whirls on me and says:  \"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?\\n\\xa0We\\'d skin him if he done that.\"\\n\"How can he blow?\\n\\xa0Hain\\'t he run off?\"\\n\"No!\\n\\xa0That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money\\'s gone.\"\\n\"_Sold_ him?\"\\n\\xa0I says, and begun to cry; \"why, he was _my_ nigger, and that was my money.\\n\\xa0Where is he?\\nI want my nigger.\"\\n\"Well, you can\\'t _get_ your nigger, that\\'s all so dry up your blubbering.\\nLooky here do you think _you\\'d_ venture to blow on us?\\n\\xa0Blamed if I think I\\'d trust you.\\n\\xa0Why, if you _was_ to blow on us.\"\\nHe stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before.\\nI went on a-whimpering, and says:  \"I don\\'t want to blow on nobody; and I ain\\'t got no time to blow, nohow.\\nI got to turn out and find my nigger.\"\\nHe looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.\\n\\xa0At last he says:  \"I\\'ll tell you something.\\n\\xa0We got to be here three days.\\n\\xa0If you\\'ll promise you won\\'t blow, and won\\'t let the nigger blow, I\\'ll tell you where to find him.\"\\nSo I promised, and he says:  \"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph.\"\\nand then he stopped.\\n\\xa0You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.\\n\\xa0And so he was.\\nHe wouldn\\'t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days.\\n\\xa0So pretty soon he says:  \"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster Abram G.\\nFoster and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\"\\n\"All right.\"\\nI says, \"I can walk it in three days.\\n\\xa0And I\\'ll start this very afternoon.\"\\n\"No you wont, you\\'ll start _now_; and don\\'t you lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.\\n\\xa0Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won\\'t get into trouble with _us_, d\\'ye hear?\"\\nThat was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.\\n\\xa0I wanted to be left free to work my plans.\\n\"So clear out.\"\\nhe says; \"and you can tell Mr.\\nFoster whatever you want to.\\nMaybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger some idiots don\\'t require documents leastways I\\'ve heard there\\'s such down South here.\\n\\xa0And when you tell him the handbill and the reward\\'s bogus, maybe he\\'ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting \\'em out.\\n\\xa0Go \\'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don\\'t work your jaw any _between_ here and there.\"\\nSo I left, and struck for the back country.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t look around, but I kinder felt like he was watching me.\\n\\xa0But I knowed I could tire him out at that.\\n\\xa0I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps\\'.\\n\\xa0I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim\\'s mouth till these fellows could get away.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t want no trouble with their kind.\\n\\xa0I\\'d seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.\\nWHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody\\'s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it\\'s spirits whispering spirits that\\'s been dead ever so many years and you always think they\\'re talking about _you_.\\n\\xa0As a general thing it makes a body wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.\\nPhelps\\' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all look alike.\\n\\xa0A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t\\'other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton fields begins, and after the fields the woods.\\nI went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started for the kitchen.\\n\\xa0When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead for that _is_ the lonesomest sound in the whole world.\\nI went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I\\'d noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone.\\nWhen I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.\\n\\xa0And such another powwow as they made!\\n\\xa0In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you may say spokes made out of dogs circle of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.\\nA nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her hand, singing out, \"Begone _you_ Tige!\\nyou Spot!\\nbegone sah.\"\\nand she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling, and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back, wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t no harm in a hound, nohow.\\nAnd behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother\\'s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always do.\\n\\xa0And here comes the white woman running from the house, about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same way the little niggers was doing.\\n\\xa0She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand and says:  \"It\\'s _you_, at last!\\n_ain\\'t_ it?\"\\nI out with a \"Yes\\'.\"\\nbefore I thought.\\nShe grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and she couldn\\'t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, \"You don\\'t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don\\'t care for that, I\\'m so glad to see you!\\n\\xa0Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you up!\\n\\xa0Children, it\\'s your cousin Tom!\\ntell him howdy.\"\\nBut they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and hid behind her.\\n\\xa0So she run on:  \"Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away or did you get your breakfast on the boat?\"\\nI said I had got it on the boat.\\n\\xa0So then she started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.\\n\\xa0When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:  \"Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I\\'ve been hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it\\'s come at last!\\nWe been expecting you a couple of days and more.\\n\\xa0What kep\\' you?\\nboat get aground?\"\\n\"Yes\\'m she.\"\\n\"Don\\'t say yes\\'m say Aunt Sally.\\n\\xa0Where\\'d she get aground?\"\\nI didn\\'t rightly know what to say, because I didn\\'t know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down.\\n\\xa0But I go a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up from down towards Orleans.\\nThat didn\\'t help me much, though; for I didn\\'t know the names of bars down that way.\\n\\xa0I see I\\'d got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on or Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out:  \"It warn\\'t the grounding that didn\\'t keep us back but a little.\\n\\xa0We blowed out a cylinder-head.\"\\n\"Good gracious!\\nanybody hurt?\"\\n\"No\\'m.\\n\\xa0Killed a nigger.\"\\n\"Well, it\\'s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.\\n\\xa0Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.\\n\\xa0And I think he died afterwards.\\n\\xa0He was a Baptist.\\n\\xa0Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.\\n\\xa0Yes, I remember now, he _did_ die.\\n\\xa0Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him.\\nBut it didn\\'t save him.\\n\\xa0Yes, it was mortification that was it.\\n\\xa0He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection.\\nThey say he was a sight to look at.\\n\\xa0Your uncle\\'s been up to the town every day to fetch you.\\nAnd he\\'s gone again, not more\\'n an hour ago; he\\'ll be back any minute now.\\nYou must a met him on the road, didn\\'t you?\\noldish man, with a.\"\\n\"No, I didn\\'t see nobody, Aunt Sally.\\n\\xa0The boat landed just at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.\"\\n\"Who\\'d you give the baggage to?\"\\n\"Nobody.\"\\n\"Why, child, it \\'ll be stole.\"\\n\"Not where I hid it I reckon it won\\'t.\"\\nI says.\\n\"How\\'d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?\"\\nIt was kinder thin ice, but I says:  \"The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers\\' lunch, and give me all I wanted.\"\\nI was getting so uneasy I couldn\\'t listen good.\\n\\xa0I had my mind on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little, and find out who I was.\\n\\xa0But I couldn\\'t get no show, Mrs.\\nPhelps kept it up and run on so.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back, because she says:  \"But here we\\'re a-running on this way, and you hain\\'t told me a word about Sis, nor any of them.\\n\\xa0Now I\\'ll rest my works a little, and you start up yourn; just tell me _everything_ tell me all about \\'m all every one of \\'m; and how they are, and what they\\'re doing, and what they told you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.\"\\nWell, I see I was up a stump and up it good.\\n\\xa0Providence had stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.\\n\\xa0I see it warn\\'t a bit of use to try to go ahead I\\'d got to throw up my hand.\\n\\xa0So I says to myself, here\\'s another place where I got to resk the truth.\\n\\xa0I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:  \"Here he comes!\\n\\xa0Stick your head down lower there, that\\'ll do; you can\\'t be seen now.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t you let on you\\'re here.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll play a joke on him.\\nChildren, don\\'t you say a word.\"\\nI see I was in a fix now.\\n\\xa0But it warn\\'t no use to worry; there warn\\'t nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck.\\nI had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then the bed hid him.\\n\\xa0Mrs.\\nPhelps she jumps for him, and says:  \"Has he come?\"\\n\"No.\"\\nsays her husband.\\n\"Good-_ness_ gracious.\"\\nshe says, \"what in the warld can have become of him?\"\\n\"I can\\'t imagine.\"\\nsays the old gentleman; \"and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy.\"\\n\"Uneasy.\"\\nshe says; \"I\\'m ready to go distracted!\\n\\xa0He _must_ a come; and you\\'ve missed him along the road.\\n\\xa0I _know_ it\\'s so something tells me so.\"\\n\"Why, Sally, I _couldn\\'t_ miss him along the road _you_ know that.\"\\n\"But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say!\\n\\xa0He must a come!\\n\\xa0You must a missed him.\\n\\xa0He.\"\\n\"Oh, don\\'t distress me any more\\'n I\\'m already distressed.\\n\\xa0I don\\'t know what in the world to make of it.\\n\\xa0I\\'m at my wit\\'s end, and I don\\'t mind acknowledging \\'t I\\'m right down scared.\\n\\xa0But there\\'s no hope that he\\'s come; for he _couldn\\'t_ come and me miss him.\\n\\xa0Sally, it\\'s terrible just terrible something\\'s happened to the boat, sure.\"\\n\"Why, Silas!\\n\\xa0Look yonder!\\nup the road!\\nain\\'t that somebody coming?\"\\nHe sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.\\nPhelps the chance she wanted.\\n\\xa0She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.\\n\\xa0The old gentleman stared, and says:  \"Why, who\\'s that?\"\\n\"Who do you reckon \\'t is?\"\\n\"I hain\\'t no idea.\\n\\xa0Who _is_ it?\"\\n\"It\\'s _Tom Sawyer!.\"\\nBy jings, I most slumped through the floor!\\n\\xa0But there warn\\'t no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.\\nBut if they was joyful, it warn\\'t nothing to what I was; for it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.\\n\\xa0Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn\\'t hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family I mean the Sawyer family than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.\\n\\xa0And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it.\\n\\xa0Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because _they_ didn\\'t know but what it would take three days to fix it.\\n\\xa0If I\\'d a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well.\\nNow I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty uncomfortable all up the other.\\n\\xa0Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river.\\n\\xa0Then I says to myself, s\\'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat?\\n\\xa0And s\\'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?\\nWell, I couldn\\'t _have_ it that way; it wouldn\\'t do at all.\\n\\xa0I must go up the road and waylay him.\\n\\xa0So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage.\\n\\xa0The old gentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn\\'t take no trouble about me.\\nSO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till he come along.\\n\\xa0I says \"Hold on.\"\\nand it stopped alongside, and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that\\'s got a dry throat, and then says:  \"I hain\\'t ever done you no harm.\\n\\xa0You know that.\\n\\xa0So, then, what you want to come back and ha\\'nt _me_ for?\"\\nI says:  \"I hain\\'t come back I hain\\'t been _gone_.\"\\nWhen he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn\\'t quite satisfied yet.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"Don\\'t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn\\'t on you.\\n\\xa0Honest injun now, you ain\\'t a ghost?\"\\n\"Honest injun, I ain\\'t.\"\\nI says.\\n\"Well I I well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can\\'t somehow seem to understand it no way.\\n\\xa0Looky here, warn\\'t you ever murdered _at all?.\"\\n\"No.\\n\\xa0I warn\\'t ever murdered at all I played it on them.\\n\\xa0You come in here and feel of me if you don\\'t believe me.\"\\nSo he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again he didn\\'t know what to do.\\n\\xa0And he wanted to know all about it right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him where he lived.\\n\\xa0But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?\\n\\xa0He said, let him alone a minute, and don\\'t disturb him.\\n\\xa0So he thought and thought, and pretty soon he says:  \"It\\'s all right; I\\'ve got it.\\n\\xa0Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on it\\'s your\\'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I\\'ll go towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn\\'t let on to know me at first.\"\\nI says:  \"All right; but wait a minute.\\n\\xa0There\\'s one more thing a thing that _nobody_ don\\'t know but me.\\n\\xa0And that is, there\\'s a nigger here that I\\'m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_ old Miss Watson\\'s Jim.\"\\nHe says:  \"What!\\n\\xa0Why, Jim is.\"\\nHe stopped and went to studying.\\n\\xa0I says:  \"I know what you\\'ll say.\\n\\xa0You\\'ll say it\\'s dirty, low-down business; but what if it is?\\n\\xa0I\\'m low down; and I\\'m a-going to steal him, and I want you keep mum and not let on.\\n\\xa0Will you?\"\\nHis eye lit up, and he says:  \"I\\'ll _help_ you steal him.\"\\nWell, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.\\n\\xa0It was the most astonishing speech I ever heard and I\\'m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation.\\n\\xa0Only I couldn\\'t believe it.\\n\\xa0Tom Sawyer a _nigger-stealer!_  \"Oh, shucks.\"\\n\\xa0I says; \"you\\'re joking.\"\\n\"I ain\\'t joking, either.\"\\n\"Well, then.\"\\nI says, \"joking or no joking, if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger, don\\'t forget to remember that _you_ don\\'t know nothing about him, and I don\\'t know nothing about him.\"\\nThen we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way and I drove mine.\\n\\xa0But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip.\\n\\xa0The old gentleman was at the door, and he says:  \"Why, this is wonderful!\\n\\xa0Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it?\\n\\xa0I wish we\\'d a timed her.\\n\\xa0And she hain\\'t sweated a hair not a hair.\\nIt\\'s wonderful.\\n\\xa0Why, I wouldn\\'t take a hundred dollars for that horse now I wouldn\\'t, honest; and yet I\\'d a sold her for fifteen before, and thought \\'twas all she was worth.\"\\nThat\\'s all he said.\\n\\xa0He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.\\nBut it warn\\'t surprising; because he warn\\'t only just a farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too.\\n\\xa0There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way, down South.\\nIn about half an hour Tom\\'s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty yards, and says:  \"Why, there\\'s somebody come!\\n\\xa0I wonder who \\'tis?\\n\\xa0Why, I do believe it\\'s a stranger.\\n\\xa0Jimm.\"\\n(that\\'s one of the children) \"run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner.\"\\nEverybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger don\\'t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for interest, when he does come.\\n\\xa0Tom was over the stile and starting for the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front door.\\n\\xa0Tom had his store clothes on, and an audience and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.\\n\\xa0In them circumstances it warn\\'t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable.\\n\\xa0He warn\\'t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no, he come ca\\'m and important, like the ram.\\n\\xa0When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn\\'t want to disturb them, and says:  \"Mr.\\nArchibald Nichols, I presume?\"\\n\"No, my boy.\"\\nsays the old gentleman, \"I\\'m sorry to say \\'t your driver has deceived you; Nichols\\'s place is down a matter of three mile more.\\nCome in, come in.\"\\nTom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, \"Too late he\\'s out of sight.\"\\n\"Yes, he\\'s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with us; and then we\\'ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols\\'s.\"\\n\"Oh, I _can\\'t_ make you so much trouble; I couldn\\'t think of it.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll walk I don\\'t mind the distance.\"\\n\"But we won\\'t _let_ you walk it wouldn\\'t be Southern hospitality to do it.\\nCome right in.\"\\n\"Oh, _do_.\"\\nsays Aunt Sally; \"it ain\\'t a bit of trouble to us, not a bit in the world.\\n\\xa0You must stay.\\n\\xa0It\\'s a long, dusty three mile, and we can\\'t let you walk.\\n\\xa0And, besides, I\\'ve already told \\'em to put on another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn\\'t disappoint us.\\n\\xa0Come right in and make yourself at home.\"\\nSo Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson and he made another bow.\\nWell, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last, still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand, and says:  \"You owdacious puppy.\"\\nHe looked kind of hurt, and says:  \"I\\'m surprised at you, m\\'am.\"\\n\"You\\'re s\\'rp Why, what do you reckon I am?\\n\\xa0I\\'ve a good notion to take and Say, what do you mean by kissing me?\"\\nHe looked kind of humble, and says:  \"I didn\\'t mean nothing, m\\'am.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t mean no harm.\\n\\xa0I I thought you\\'d like it.\"\\n\"Why, you born fool.\"\\n\\xa0She took up the spinning stick, and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.\\n\\xa0\"What made you think I\\'d like it?\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know.\\n\\xa0Only, they they told me you would.\"\\n\"_They_ told you I would.\\n\\xa0Whoever told you\\'s _another_ lunatic.\\n\\xa0I never heard the beat of it.\\n\\xa0Who\\'s _they_?\"\\n\"Why, everybody.\\n\\xa0They all said so, m\\'am.\"\\nIt was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:  \"Who\\'s \\'everybody\\'?\\n\\xa0Out with their names, or ther\\'ll be an idiot short.\"\\nHe got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:  \"I\\'m sorry, and I warn\\'t expecting it.\\n\\xa0They told me to.\\n\\xa0They all told me to.\\n\\xa0They all said, kiss her; and said she\\'d like it.\\n\\xa0They all said it every one of them.\\n\\xa0But I\\'m sorry, m\\'am, and I won\\'t do it no more I won\\'t, honest.\"\\n\"You won\\'t, won\\'t you?\\n\\xa0Well, I sh\\'d _reckon_ you won\\'t.\"\\n\"No\\'m, I\\'m honest about it; I won\\'t ever do it again till you ask me.\"\\n\"Till I _ask_ you!\\n\\xa0Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!\\n\\xa0I lay you\\'ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you or the likes of you.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nhe says, \"it does surprise me so.\\n\\xa0I can\\'t make it out, somehow.\\nThey said you would, and I thought you would.\\n\\xa0But.\"\\nHe stopped and looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman\\'s, and says, \"Didn\\'t _you_ think she\\'d like me to kiss her, sir?\"\\n\"Why, no; I I well, no, I b\\'lieve I didn\\'t.\"\\nThen he looks on around the same way to me, and says:  \"Tom, didn\\'t _you_ think Aunt Sally \\'d open out her arms and say, \\'Sid Sawyer .\"\\n\"My land.\"\\nshe says, breaking in and jumping for him, \"you impudent young rascal, to fool a body so.\"\\nand was going to hug him, but he fended her off, and says:  \"No, not till you\\'ve asked me first.\"\\nSo she didn\\'t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he took what was left.\\n\\xa0And after they got a little quiet again she says:  \"Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.\\n\\xa0We warn\\'t looking for _you_ at all, but only Tom.\\n\\xa0Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him.\"\\n\"It\\'s because it warn\\'t _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom.\"\\nhe says; \"but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.\\n\\xa0But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally.\\n\\xa0This ain\\'t no healthy place for a stranger to come.\"\\n\"No not impudent whelps, Sid.\\n\\xa0You ought to had your jaws boxed; I hain\\'t been so put out since I don\\'t know when.\\n\\xa0But I don\\'t care, I don\\'t mind the terms I\\'d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here.\\nWell, to think of that performance!\\n\\xa0I don\\'t deny it, I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.\"\\nWe had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that\\'s laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning.\\n\\xa0Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn\\'t cool it a bit, neither, the way I\\'ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\\n\\xa0There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn\\'t no use, they didn\\'t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it.\\n\\xa0But at supper, at night, one of the little boys says:  \"Pa, mayn\\'t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?\"\\n\"No.\"\\nsays the old man, \"I reckon there ain\\'t going to be any; and you couldn\\'t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people; so I reckon they\\'ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time.\"\\nSo there it was!\\nbut I couldn\\'t help it.\\n\\xa0Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn\\'t believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn\\'t hurry up and give them one they\\'d get into trouble sure.\\nOn the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn\\'t come back no more, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it--it was as much as half-after eight, then here comes a raging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn\\'t look like nothing in the world that was human just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes.\\n\\xa0Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn\\'t ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world.\\n\\xa0It was a dreadful thing to see.\\n\\xa0Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.\\nWe see we was too late couldn\\'t do no good.\\n\\xa0We asked some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and went for them.\\nSo we poked along back home, and I warn\\'t feeling so brash as I was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow though I hadn\\'t done nothing.\\n\\xa0But that\\'s always the way; it don\\'t make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person\\'s conscience ain\\'t got no sense, and just goes for him anyway.\\n\\xa0If I had a yaller dog that didn\\'t know no more than a person\\'s conscience does I would pison him.\\nIt takes up more room than all the rest of a person\\'s insides, and yet ain\\'t no good, nohow.\\n\\xa0Tom Sawyer he says the same.\\nWE stopped talking, and got to thinking.\\n\\xa0By and by Tom says:  \"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!\\n\\xa0I bet I know where Jim is.\"\\n\"No!\\n\\xa0Where?\"\\n\"In that hut down by the ash-hopper.\\n\\xa0Why, looky here.\\n\\xa0When we was at dinner, didn\\'t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"What did you think the vittles was for?\"\\n\"For a dog.\"\\n\"So \\'d I.\\nWell, it wasn\\'t for a dog.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because part of it was watermelon.\"\\n\"So it was I noticed it.\\n\\xa0Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon.\\n\\xa0It shows how a body can see and don\\'t see at the same time.\"\\n\"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it again when he came out.\\n\\xa0He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table same key, I bet.\\n\\xa0Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain\\'t likely there\\'s two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people\\'s all so kind and good.\\n\\xa0Jim\\'s the prisoner.\\n\\xa0All right I\\'m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn\\'t give shucks for any other way.\\n\\xa0Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we\\'ll take the one we like the best.\"\\nWhat a head for just a boy to have!\\n\\xa0If I had Tom Sawyer\\'s head I wouldn\\'t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of.\\n\\xa0I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon Tom says:  \"Ready?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nI says.\\n\"All right bring it out.\"\\n\"My plan is this.\"\\nI says.\\n\\xa0\"We can easy find out if it\\'s Jim in there.\\nThen get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island.\\n\\xa0Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man\\'s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before.\\n\\xa0Wouldn\\'t that plan work?\"\\n\"_Work_?\\n\\xa0Why, cert\\'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.\\n\\xa0But it\\'s too blame\\' simple; there ain\\'t nothing _to_ it.\\n\\xa0What\\'s the good of a plan that ain\\'t no more trouble than that?\\n\\xa0It\\'s as mild as goose-milk.\\n\\xa0Why, Huck, it wouldn\\'t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.\"\\nI never said nothing, because I warn\\'t expecting nothing different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn\\'t have none of them objections to it.\\nAnd it didn\\'t.\\n\\xa0He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.\\n\\xa0So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it.\\n\\xa0I needn\\'t tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn\\'t stay the way, it was.\\n\\xa0I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance.\\n\\xa0And that is what he done.\\nWell, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.\\nThat was the thing that was too many for me.\\n\\xa0Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before everybody.\\n\\xa0I _couldn\\'t_ understand it no way at all.\\n\\xa0It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself.\\nAnd I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:  \"Don\\'t you reckon I know what I\\'m about?\\n\\xa0Don\\'t I generly know what I\\'m about?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Didn\\'t I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"_Well_, then.\"\\nThat\\'s all he said, and that\\'s all I said.\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t no use to say any more; because when he said he\\'d do a thing, he always done it.\\n\\xa0But I couldn\\'t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about it.\\n\\xa0If he was bound to have it so, I couldn\\'t help it.\\nWhen we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.\\n\\xa0We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do.\\n\\xa0They knowed us, and didn\\'t make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night.\\n\\xa0When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn\\'t acquainted with which was the north side we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it.\\n\\xa0I says:  \"Here\\'s the ticket.\\n\\xa0This hole\\'s big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board.\"\\nTom says:  \"It\\'s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky.\\n\\xa0I should _hope_ we can find a way that\\'s a little more complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.\"\\n\"Well, then.\"\\nI says, \"how \\'ll it do to saw him out, the way I done before I was murdered that time?\"\\n\"That\\'s more _like_.\"\\nhe says.\\n\\xa0\"It\\'s real mysterious, and troublesome, and good.\"\\nhe says; \"but I bet we can find a way that\\'s twice as long.\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t no hurry; le\\'s keep on looking around.\"\\nBetwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.\\n\\xa0It was as long as the hut, but narrow only about six foot wide.\\n\\xa0The door to it was at the south end, and was padlocked.\\n\\xa0Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples.\\n\\xa0The chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn\\'t no connection with it; and there warn\\'t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\\n\\xa0The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever.\\nTom was joyful.\\n\\xa0He says;  \"Now we\\'re all right.\\n\\xa0We\\'ll _dig_ him out.\\n\\xa0It \\'ll take about a week.\"\\nThen we started for the house, and I went in the back door you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don\\'t fasten the doors but that warn\\'t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning-rod.\\n\\xa0But after he got up half way about three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most busted his brains out, he thought he\\'d got to give it up; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time he made the trip.\\nIn the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim if it _was_ Jim that was being fed.\\n\\xa0The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim\\'s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house.\\nThis nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread.\\n\\xa0That was to keep witches off.\\n\\xa0He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn\\'t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life.\\n\\xa0He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he\\'d been a-going to do.\\n\\xa0So Tom says:  \"What\\'s the vittles for?\\n\\xa0Going to feed the dogs?\"\\nThe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:  \"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.\\n\\xa0Cur\\'us dog, too.\\n\\xa0Does you want to go en look at \\'im?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nI hunched Tom, and whispers:  \"You going, right here in the daybreak?\\n\\xa0_that_ warn\\'t the plan.\"\\n\"No, it warn\\'t; but it\\'s the plan _now_.\"\\nSo, drat him, we went along, but I didn\\'t like it much.\\n\\xa0When we got in we couldn\\'t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:  \"Why, _Huck_!\\n\\xa0En good _lan_\\'!\\nain\\' dat Misto Tom?\"\\nI just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn\\'t a done it, because that nigger busted in and says:  \"Why, de gracious sakes!\\ndo he know you genlmen?\"\\nWe could see pretty well now.\\n\\xa0Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and kind of wondering, and says:  \"Does _who_ know us?\"\\n\"Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.\"\\n\"I don\\'t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?\"\\n\"What _put_ it dar?\\n\\xa0Didn\\' he jis\\' dis minute sing out like he knowed you?\"\\nTom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:  \"Well, that\\'s mighty curious.\\n\\xa0_Who_ sung out?\\n_when_ did he sing out?\\n\\xa0_what_ did he sing out?\"\\nAnd turns to me, perfectly ca\\'m, and says, \"Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?\"\\nOf course there warn\\'t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:  \"No; I ain\\'t heard nobody say nothing.\"\\nThen he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and says:  \"Did you sing out?\"\\n\"No, sah.\"\\nsays Jim; \"I hain\\'t said nothing, sah.\"\\n\"Not a word?\"\\n\"No, sah, I hain\\'t said a word.\"\\n\"Did you ever see us before?\"\\n\"No, sah; not as I knows on.\"\\nSo Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and says, kind of severe:  \"What do you reckon\\'s the matter with you, anyway?\\n\\xa0What made you think somebody sung out?\"\\n\"Oh, it\\'s de dad-blame\\' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.\\n\\xa0Dey\\'s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos\\' kill me, dey sk\\'yers me so.\\n\\xa0Please to don\\'t tell nobody \\'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he\\'ll scole me; \\'kase he say dey _ain\\'t_ no witches.\\n\\xa0I jis\\' wish to goodness he was heah now _den_ what would he say!\\n\\xa0I jis\\' bet he couldn\\' fine no way to git aroun\\' it _dis_ time.\\n\\xa0But it\\'s awluz jis\\' so; people dat\\'s _sot_, stays sot; dey won\\'t look into noth\\'n\\'en fine it out f\\'r deyselves, en when _you_ fine it out en tell um \\'bout it, dey doan\\' b\\'lieve you.\"\\nTom give him a dime, and said we wouldn\\'t tell nobody; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:  \"I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.\\n\\xa0If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn\\'t give him up, I\\'d hang him.\"\\n\\xa0And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and says:  \"Don\\'t ever let on to know us.\\n\\xa0And if you hear any digging going on nights, it\\'s us; we\\'re going to set you free.\"\\nJim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger come back, and we said we\\'d come again some time if the nigger wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then.\\nIT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down into the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that\\'s called fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place.\\n\\xa0We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:  \"Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.\\nAnd so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t no watchman to be drugged now there _ought_ to be a watchman.\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.\\n\\xa0And there\\'s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: \\xa0why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain.\\n\\xa0And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don\\'t send nobody to watch the nigger.\\n\\xa0Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn\\'t be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.\\n\\xa0Why, drat it, Huck, it\\'s the stupidest arrangement I ever see.\\nYou got to invent _all_ the difficulties.\\n\\xa0Well, we can\\'t help it; we got to do the best we can with the materials we\\'ve got.\\nAnyhow, there\\'s one thing there\\'s more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn\\'t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head.\\n\\xa0Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.\\n\\xa0When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that a lantern\\'s resky.\\n\\xa0Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe.\\n\\xa0Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get.\"\\n\"What do we want of a saw?\"\\n\"What do we _want_ of it?\\n\\xa0Hain\\'t we got to saw the leg of Jim\\'s bed off, so as to get the chain loose?\"\\n\"Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off.\"\\n\"Well, if that ain\\'t just like you, Huck Finn.\\n\\xa0You _can_ get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.\\n\\xa0Why, hain\\'t you ever read any books at all?\\nBaron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?\\n\\xa0Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?\\n\\xa0No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can\\'t be found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can\\'t see no sign of it\\'s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.\\nThen, the night you\\'re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you are.\\n\\xa0Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know and there\\'s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is.\\nIt\\'s gaudy, Huck.\\n\\xa0I wish there was a moat to this cabin.\\nIf we get time, the night of the escape, we\\'ll dig one.\"\\nI says:  \"What do we want of a moat when we\\'re going to snake him out from under the cabin?\"\\nBut he never heard me.\\n\\xa0He had forgot me and everything else.\\n\\xa0He had his chin in his hand, thinking.\\n\\xa0Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head; then sighs again, and says:  \"No, it wouldn\\'t do there ain\\'t necessity enough for it.\"\\n\"For what?\"\\n\\xa0I says.\\n\"Why, to saw Jim\\'s leg off.\"\\nhe says.\\n\"Good land.\"\\n\\xa0I says; \"why, there ain\\'t _no_ necessity for it.\\n\\xa0And what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?\"\\n\"Well, some of the best authorities has done it.\\n\\xa0They couldn\\'t get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.\\n\\xa0And a leg would be better still.\\n\\xa0But we got to let that go.\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim\\'s a nigger, and wouldn\\'t understand the reasons for it, and how it\\'s the custom in Europe; so we\\'ll let it go.\\n\\xa0But there\\'s one thing he can have a rope ladder; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.\\n\\xa0And we can send it to him in a pie; it\\'s mostly done that way.\\n\\xa0And I\\'ve et worse pies.\"\\n\"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk.\"\\nI says; \"Jim ain\\'t got no use for a rope ladder.\"\\n\"He _has_ got use for it.\\n\\xa0How _you_ talk, you better say; you don\\'t know nothing about it.\\n\\xa0He\\'s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.\"\\n\"What in the nation can he _do_ with it?\"\\n\"_Do_ with it?\\n\\xa0He can hide it in his bed, can\\'t he?\"\\n\\xa0That\\'s what they all do; and _he\\'s_ got to, too.\\n\\xa0Huck, you don\\'t ever seem to want to do anything that\\'s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time.\\nS\\'pose he _don\\'t_ do nothing with it?\\nain\\'t it there in his bed, for a clew, after he\\'s gone?\\nand don\\'t you reckon they\\'ll want clews?\\n\\xa0Of course they will.\\n\\xa0And you wouldn\\'t leave them any?\\n\\xa0That would be a _pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn\\'t_ it!\\n\\xa0I never heard of such a thing.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nI says, \"if it\\'s in the regulations, and he\\'s got to have it, all right, let him have it; because I don\\'t wish to go back on no regulations; but there\\'s one thing, Tom Sawyer if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we\\'re going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you\\'re born.\\n\\xa0Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don\\'t cost nothing, and don\\'t waste nothing, and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain\\'t had no experience, and so he don\\'t care what kind of a.\"\\n\"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I\\'d keep still that\\'s what I\\'D do.\\n\\xa0Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder?\\n\\xa0Why, it\\'s perfectly ridiculous.\"\\n\"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you\\'ll take my advice, you\\'ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.\"\\nHe said that would do.\\n\\xa0And that gave him another idea, and he says:  \"Borrow a shirt, too.\"\\n\"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?\"\\n\"Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.\"\\n\"Journal your granny _Jim_ can\\'t write.\"\\n\"S\\'pose he _can\\'t_ write he can make marks on the shirt, can\\'t he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop?\"\\n\"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one; and quicker, too.\"\\n\"_Prisoners_ don\\'t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of, you muggins.\\n\\xa0They _always_ make their pens out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they\\'ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall.\\n\\xa0_They_ wouldn\\'t use a goose-quill if they had it.\\nIt ain\\'t regular.\"\\n\"Well, then, what\\'ll we make him the ink out of?\"\\n\"Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that\\'s the common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood.\\n\\xa0Jim can do that; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he\\'s captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.\\n\\xa0The Iron Mask always done that, and it\\'s a blame\\' good way, too.\"\\n\"Jim ain\\'t got no tin plates.\\n\\xa0They feed him in a pan.\"\\n\"That ain\\'t nothing; we can get him some.\"\\n\"Can\\'t nobody _read_ his plates.\"\\n\"That ain\\'t got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn.\\n\\xa0All _he\\'s_ got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out.\\n\\xa0You don\\'t _have_ to be able to read it.\\nWhy, half the time you can\\'t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.\"\\n\"Well, then, what\\'s the sense in wasting the plates?\"\\n\"Why, blame it all, it ain\\'t the _prisoner\\'s_ plates.\"\\n\"But it\\'s _somebody\\'s_ plates, ain\\'t it?\"\\n\"Well, spos\\'n it is?\\n\\xa0What does the _prisoner_ care whose.\"\\nHe broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.\\n\\xa0So we cleared out for the house.\\nAlong during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.\\n\\xa0I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn\\'t borrowing, it was stealing.\\n\\xa0He said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don\\'t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don\\'t blame them for it, either.\\n\\xa0It ain\\'t no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it\\'s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with.\\n\\xa0He said if we warn\\'t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn\\'t a prisoner.\\n\\xa0So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy.\\n\\xa0And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for.\\nTom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we _needed_.\\nWell, I says, I needed the watermelon.\\n\\xa0But he said I didn\\'t need it to get out of prison with; there\\'s where the difference was.\\n\\xa0He said if I\\'d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.\\n\\xa0So I let it go at that, though I couldn\\'t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.\\nWell, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch.\\n\\xa0By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"Everything\\'s all right now except tools; and that\\'s easy fixed.\"\\n\"Tools?\"\\n\\xa0I says.\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Tools for what?\"\\n\"Why, to dig with.\\n\\xa0We ain\\'t a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?\"\\n\"Ain\\'t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with?\"\\n\\xa0I says.\\nHe turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:  \"Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?\\n\\xa0Now I want to ask you if you got any reasonableness in you at all what kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero?\\n\\xa0Why, they might as well lend him the key and done with it.\\n\\xa0Picks and shovels why, they wouldn\\'t furnish \\'em to a king.\"\\n\"Well, then.\"\\nI says, \"if we don\\'t want the picks and shovels, what do we want?\"\\n\"A couple of case-knives.\"\\n\"To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Confound it, it\\'s foolish, Tom.\"\\n\"It don\\'t make no difference how foolish it is, it\\'s the _right_ way and it\\'s the regular way.\\n\\xa0And there ain\\'t no _other_ way, that ever I heard of, and I\\'ve read all the books that gives any information about these things.\\nThey always dig out with a case-knife and not through dirt, mind you; generly it\\'s through solid rock.\\n\\xa0And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever.\\n\\xa0Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was _he_ at it, you reckon?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\"Well, guess.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\\n\\xa0A month and a half.\"\\n\"_Thirty-seven year_ and he come out in China.\\n\\xa0_That\\'s_ the kind.\\n\\xa0I wish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.\"\\n\"_Jim_ don\\'t know nobody in China.\"\\n\"What\\'s _that_ got to do with it?\\n\\xa0Neither did that other fellow.\\n\\xa0But you\\'re always a-wandering off on a side issue.\\n\\xa0Why can\\'t you stick to the main point?\"\\n\"All right I don\\'t care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; and Jim don\\'t, either, I reckon.\\n\\xa0But there\\'s one thing, anyway Jim\\'s too old to be dug out with a case-knife.\\n\\xa0He won\\'t last.\"\\n\"Yes he will _last_, too.\\n\\xa0You don\\'t reckon it\\'s going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?\"\\n\"How long will it take, Tom?\"\\n\"Well, we can\\'t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn\\'t take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.\\n\\xa0He\\'ll hear Jim ain\\'t from there.\\n\\xa0Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that.\\n\\xa0So we can\\'t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to.\\n\\xa0By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can\\'t.\\n\\xa0Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: \\xa0that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years.\\n\\xa0Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there\\'s an alarm.\\n\\xa0Yes, I reckon that \\'ll be the best way.\"\\n\"Now, there\\'s _sense_ in that.\"\\nI says.\\n\\xa0\"Letting on don\\'t cost nothing; letting on ain\\'t no trouble; and if it\\'s any object, I don\\'t mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.\\n\\xa0It wouldn\\'t strain me none, after I got my hand in.\\n\\xa0So I\\'ll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.\"\\n\"Smouch three.\"\\nhe says; \"we want one to make a saw out of.\"\\n\"Tom, if it ain\\'t unregular and irreligious to sejest it.\"\\nI says, \"there\\'s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.\"\\nHe looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:  \"It ain\\'t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.\\n\\xa0Run along and smouch the knives three of them.\"\\n\\xa0So I done it.\\nAS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work.\\n\\xa0We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.\\n\\xa0Tom said he was right behind Jim\\'s bed now, and we\\'d dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn\\'t nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim\\'s counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you\\'d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.\\n\\xa0So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn\\'t see we\\'d done anything hardly.\\n\\xa0At last I says:  \"This ain\\'t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer.\"\\nHe never said nothing.\\n\\xa0But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.\\nThen he says:  \"It ain\\'t no use, Huck, it ain\\'t a-going to work.\\n\\xa0If we was prisoners it would, because then we\\'d have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn\\'t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn\\'t get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done.\\n\\xa0But _we_ can\\'t fool along; we got to rush; we ain\\'t got no time to spare.\\n\\xa0If we was to put in another night this way we\\'d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well couldn\\'t touch a case-knife with them sooner.\"\\n\"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you.\\n\\xa0It ain\\'t right, and it ain\\'t moral, and I wouldn\\'t like it to get out; but there ain\\'t only just the one way: \\xa0we got to dig him out with the picks, and _let on_ it\\'s case-knives.\"\\n\"_Now_ you\\'re _talking_.\"\\n\\xa0I says; \"your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer.\"\\nI says.\\n\\xa0\"Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don\\'t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.\\n\\xa0When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain\\'t no ways particular how it\\'s done so it\\'s done.\\n\\xa0What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick\\'s the handiest thing, that\\'s the thing I\\'m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don\\'t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nhe says, \"there\\'s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn\\'t so, I wouldn\\'t approve of it, nor I wouldn\\'t stand by and see the rules broke because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain\\'t got no business doing wrong when he ain\\'t ignorant and knows better.\\n\\xa0It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick, _without_ any letting on, because you don\\'t know no better; but it wouldn\\'t for me, because I do know better.\\n\\xa0Gimme a case-knife.\"\\nHe had his own by him, but I handed him mine.\\n\\xa0He flung it down, and says:  \"Gimme a _case-knife_.\"\\nI didn\\'t know just what to do but then I thought.\\n\\xa0I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word.\\nHe was always just that particular.\\n\\xa0Full of principle.\\nSo then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly.\\n\\xa0We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it.\\nWhen I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn\\'t come it, his hands was so sore.\\n\\xa0At last he says:  \"It ain\\'t no use, it can\\'t be done.\\n\\xa0What you reckon I better do?\\n\\xa0Can\\'t you think of no way?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nI says, \"but I reckon it ain\\'t regular.\\n\\xa0Come up the stairs, and let on it\\'s a lightning-rod.\"\\nSo he done it.\\nNext day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates.\\n\\xa0Tom says it wasn\\'t enough; but I said nobody wouldn\\'t ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they\\'d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole then we could tote them back and he could use them over again.\\n\\xa0So Tom was satisfied.\\n\\xa0Then he says:  \"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\"\\n\"Take them in through the hole.\"\\nI says, \"when we get it done.\"\\nHe only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.\\n\\xa0By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn\\'t no need to decide on any of them yet.\\n\\xa0Said we\\'d got to post Jim first.\\nThat night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn\\'t wake him.\\n\\xa0Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done.\\n\\xa0We crept in under Jim\\'s bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual.\\n\\xa0He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time.\\n\\xa0But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\\n\\xa0So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:  \"_Now_ I know how to fix it.\\n\\xa0We\\'ll send you some things by them.\"\\nI said, \"Don\\'t do nothing of the kind; it\\'s one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck.\"\\nbut he never paid no attention to me; went right on.\\n\\xa0It was his way when he\\'d got his plans set.\\nSo he told Jim how we\\'d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we would put small things in uncle\\'s coat-pockets and he must steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt\\'s apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and what they was for.\\n\\xa0And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood, and all that.\\nHe told him everything.\\n\\xa0Jim he couldn\\'t see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as Tom said.\\nJim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed, with hands that looked like they\\'d been chawed.\\n\\xa0Tom was in high spirits.\\nHe said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it.\\n\\xa0He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.\\n\\xa0And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\\nIn the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket.\\n\\xa0Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat\\'s notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim\\'s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there warn\\'t ever anything could a worked better.\\nTom said so himself.\\nJim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that\\'s always getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\\nAnd whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim\\'s bed; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn\\'t hardly room in there to get your breath.\\n\\xa0By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to door!\\n\\xa0The nigger Nat he only just hollered \"Witche.\"\\nonce, and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was dying.\\n\\xa0Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim\\'s meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he\\'d fixed the other door too.\\nThen he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and asking him if he\\'d been imagining he saw something again.\\n\\xa0He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:  \"Mars Sid, you\\'ll say I\\'s a fool, but if I didn\\'t b\\'lieve I see most a million dogs, er devils, er some\\'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks.\\n\\xa0I did, mos\\' sholy.\\n\\xa0Mars Sid, I _felt_ um I _felt_ um, sah; dey was all over me.\\n\\xa0Dad fetch it, I jis\\' wisht I could git my han\\'s on one er dem witches jis\\' wunst on\\'y jis\\' wunst it\\'s all I\\'d ast.\\n\\xa0But mos\\'ly I wisht dey\\'d lemme \\'lone, I does.\"\\nTom says:  \"Well, I tell you what I think.\\n\\xa0What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger\\'s breakfast-time?\\n\\xa0It\\'s because they\\'re hungry; that\\'s the reason.\\n\\xa0You make them a witch pie; that\\'s the thing for _you_ to do.\"\\n\"But my lan\\', Mars Sid, how\\'s I gwyne to make \\'m a witch pie?\\n\\xa0I doan\\' know how to make it.\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t ever hearn er sich a thing b\\'fo\\'.\"\\n\"Well, then, I\\'ll have to make it myself.\"\\n\"Will you do it, honey?\\nwill you?\\n\\xa0I\\'ll wusshup de groun\\' und\\' yo\\' foot, I will.\"\\n\"All right, I\\'ll do it, seeing it\\'s you, and you\\'ve been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger.\\n\\xa0But you got to be mighty careful.\\n\\xa0When we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we\\'ve put in the pan, don\\'t you let on you see it at all.\\n\\xa0And don\\'t you look when Jim unloads the pan something might happen, I don\\'t know what.\\n\\xa0And above all, don\\'t you _handle_ the witch-things.\"\\n\"_Hannel \\'M_, Mars Sid?\\n\\xa0What _is_ you a-talkin\\' \\'bout?\\n\\xa0I wouldn\\' lay de weight er my finger on um, not f\\'r ten hund\\'d thous\\'n billion dollars, I wouldn\\'t.\"\\nTHAT was all fixed.\\n\\xa0So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally\\'s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t\\'other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas\\'s hat, which was on the bureau, because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger\\'s house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas\\'s coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn\\'t come yet, so we had to wait a little while.\\nAnd when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn\\'t hardly wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child\\'s head with her thimble with the other, and says:  \"I\\'ve hunted high and I\\'ve hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_ become of your other shirt.\"\\nMy heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder.\\n\\xa0But after that we was all right again it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.\\nUncle Silas he says:  \"It\\'s most uncommon curious, I can\\'t understand it.\\n\\xa0I know perfectly well I took it _off_, because.\"\\n\"Because you hain\\'t got but one _on_.\\n\\xa0Just _listen_ at the man!\\n\\xa0I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo\\'s-line yesterday I see it there myself.\\nBut it\\'s gone, that\\'s the long and the short of it, and you\\'ll just have to change to a red flann\\'l one till I can get time to make a new one.\\nAnd it \\'ll be the third I\\'ve made in two years.\\n\\xa0It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to _do_ with \\'m all is more\\'n I can make out.\\n\\xa0A body \\'d think you _would_ learn to take some sort of care of \\'em at your time of life.\"\\n\"I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.\\n\\xa0But it oughtn\\'t to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don\\'t see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they\\'re on me; and I don\\'t believe I\\'ve ever lost one of them _off_ of me.\"\\n\"Well, it ain\\'t _your_ fault if you haven\\'t, Silas; you\\'d a done it if you could, I reckon.\\n\\xa0And the shirt ain\\'t all that\\'s gone, nuther.\\n\\xa0Ther\\'s a spoon gone; and _that_ ain\\'t all.\\n\\xa0There was ten, and now ther\\'s only nine.\\nThe calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, _that\\'s_ certain.\"\\n\"Why, what else is gone, Sally?\"\\n\"Ther\\'s six _candles_ gone that\\'s what.\\n\\xa0The rats could a got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don\\'t walk off with the whole place, the way you\\'re always going to stop their holes and don\\'t do it; and if they warn\\'t fools they\\'d sleep in your hair, Silas _you\\'d_ never find it out; but you can\\'t lay the _spoon_ on the rats, and that I know.\"\\n\"Well, Sally, I\\'m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I\\'ve been remiss; but I won\\'t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.\"\\n\"Oh, I wouldn\\'t hurry; next year \\'ll do.\\n\\xa0Matilda Angelina Araminta _Phelps!.\"\\nWhack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any.\\n\\xa0Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage, and says:  \"Missus, dey\\'s a sheet gone.\"\\n\"A _sheet_ gone!\\n\\xa0Well, for the land\\'s sake.\"\\n\"I\\'ll stop up them holes to-day.\"\\nsays Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.\\n\"Oh, _do_ shet up!\\ns\\'pose the rats took the _sheet_?\\n\\xa0_where\\'s_ it gone, Lize?\"\\n\"Clah to goodness I hain\\'t no notion, Miss\\' Sally.\\n\\xa0She wuz on de clo\\'sline yistiddy, but she done gone: \\xa0she ain\\' dah no mo\\' now.\"\\n\"I reckon the world _is_ coming to an end.\\n\\xa0I _never_ see the beat of it in all my born days.\\n\\xa0A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can.\"\\n\"Missus.\"\\ncomes a young yaller wench, \"dey\\'s a brass cannelstick miss\\'n.\"\\n\"Cler out from here, you hussy, er I\\'ll take a skillet to ye.\"\\nWell, she was just a-biling.\\n\\xa0I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.\\n\\xa0She kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket.\\n\\xa0She stopped, with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in Jeruslem or somewheres.\\nBut not long, because she says:  \"It\\'s _just_ as I expected.\\n\\xa0So you had it in your pocket all the time; and like as not you\\'ve got the other things there, too.\\n\\xa0How\\'d it get there?\"\\n\"I reely don\\'t know, Sally.\"\\nhe says, kind of apologizing, \"or you know I would tell.\\n\\xa0I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain\\'t in; but I\\'ll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I\\'ll know I didn\\'t put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon, and.\"\\n\"Oh, for the land\\'s sake!\\n\\xa0Give a body a rest!\\n\\xa0Go \\'long now, the whole kit and biling of ye; and don\\'t come nigh me again till I\\'ve got back my peace of mind.\"\\nI\\'D a heard her if she\\'d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it out; and I\\'d a got up and obeyed her if I\\'d a been dead.\\n\\xa0As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.\\n\\xa0Tom see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:  \"Well, it ain\\'t no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain\\'t reliable.\"\\nThen he says: \\xa0\"But he done us a good turn with the spoon, anyway, without knowing it, and so we\\'ll go and do him one without _him_ knowing it stop up his rat-holes.\"\\nThere was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.\\n\\xa0Then we heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t\\'other, looking as absent-minded as year before last.\\n\\xa0He went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he\\'d been to them all.\\n\\xa0Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking.\\n\\xa0Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs, saying:  \"Well, for the life of me I can\\'t remember when I done it.\\n\\xa0I could show her now that I warn\\'t to blame on account of the rats.\\n\\xa0But never mind let it go.\\n\\xa0I reckon it wouldn\\'t do no good.\"\\nAnd so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.\\n\\xa0He was a mighty nice old man.\\n\\xa0And always is.\\nTom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we\\'d got to have it; so he took a think.\\n\\xa0When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says:  \"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain\\'t but nine spoons _yet_.\"\\nShe says:  \"Go \\'long to your play, and don\\'t bother me.\\n\\xa0I know better, I counted \\'m myself.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can\\'t make but nine.\"\\nShe looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count anybody would.\\n\"I declare to gracious ther\\' _ain\\'t_ but nine.\"\\nshe says.\\n\\xa0\"Why, what in the world plague _take_ the things, I\\'ll count \\'m again.\"\\nSo I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says:  \"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther\\'s _ten_ now.\"\\nand she looked huffy and bothered both.\\n\\xa0But Tom says:  \"Why, Aunty, I don\\'t think there\\'s ten.\"\\n\"You numskull, didn\\'t you see me _count \\'m?.\"\\n\"I know, but.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ll count \\'m _again_.\"\\nSo I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\\n\\xa0Well, she _was_ in a tearing way just a-trembling all over, she was so mad.\\n\\xa0But she counted and counted till she got that addled she\\'d start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong.\\n\\xa0Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cle\\'r out and let her have some peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she\\'d skin us.\\n\\xa0So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her shingle nail, before noon.\\n\\xa0We was very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took, because he said _now_ she couldn\\'t ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn\\'t believe she\\'d counted them right if she _did_; and said that after she\\'d about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she\\'d give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more.\\nSo we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didn\\'t know how many sheets she had any more, and she didn\\'t _care_, and warn\\'t a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn\\'t count them again not to save her life; she druther die first.\\nSo we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn\\'t no consequence, it would blow over by and by.\\nBut that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.\\n\\xa0We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn\\'t want nothing but a crust, and we couldn\\'t prop it up right, and she would always cave in.\\n\\xa0But of course we thought of the right way at last which was to cook the ladder, too, in the pie.\\n\\xa0So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with.\\n\\xa0We let on it took nine months to make it.\\nAnd in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn\\'t go into the pie.\\n\\xa0Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty pies if we\\'d a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.\\n\\xa0We could a had a whole dinner.\\nBut we didn\\'t need it.\\n\\xa0All we needed was just enough for the pie, and so we throwed the rest away.\\n\\xa0We didn\\'t cook none of the pies in the wash-pan afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they warn\\'t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first pies, because we didn\\'t know how, but she come up smiling on the last one.\\n\\xa0We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at.\\nBut the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn\\'t cramp him down to business I don\\'t know nothing what I\\'m talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.\\nNat didn\\'t look when we put the witch pie in Jim\\'s pan; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole.\\nMAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.\\n\\xa0That\\'s the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.\\n\\xa0But he had to have it; Tom said he\\'d _got_ to; there warn\\'t no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.\\n\"Look at Lady Jane Grey.\"\\nhe says; \"look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland!\\n\\xa0Why, Huck, s\\'pose it _is_ considerble trouble?\\nwhat you going to do?\\nhow you going to get around it?\\n\\xa0Jim\\'s _got_ to do his inscription and coat of arms.\\n\\xa0They all do.\"\\nJim says:  \"Why, Mars Tom, I hain\\'t got no coat o\\' arm; I hain\\'t got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.\"\\n\"Oh, you don\\'t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nI says, \"Jim\\'s right, anyway, when he says he ain\\'t got no coat of arms, because he hain\\'t.\"\\n\"I reckon I knowed that.\"\\nTom says, \"but you bet he\\'ll have one before he goes out of this because he\\'s going out _right_, and there ain\\'t going to be no flaws in his record.\"\\nSo whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his\\'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms.\\n\\xa0By and by he said he\\'d struck so many good ones he didn\\'t hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he\\'d decide on.\\n\\xa0He says:  \"On the scutcheon we\\'ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire _murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, _sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, _Maggiore Fretta, Minore Otto._ \\xa0Got it out of a book means the more haste the less speed.\"\\n\"Geewhillikins.\"\\nI says, \"but what does the rest of it mean?\"\\n\"We ain\\'t got no time to bother over that.\"\\nhe says; \"we got to dig in like all git-out.\"\\n\"Well, anyway.\"\\nI says, \"what\\'s _some_ of it?\\n\\xa0What\\'s a fess?\"\\n\"A fess a fess is _you_ don\\'t need to know what a fess is.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll show him how to make it when he gets to it.\"\\n\"Shucks, Tom.\"\\nI says, \"I think you might tell a person.\\n\\xa0What\\'s a bar sinister?\"\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know.\\n\\xa0But he\\'s got to have it.\\n\\xa0All the nobility does.\"\\nThat was just his way.\\n\\xa0If it didn\\'t suit him to explain a thing to you, he wouldn\\'t do it.\\n\\xa0You might pump at him a week, it wouldn\\'t make no difference.\\nHe\\'d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful inscription said Jim got to have one, like they all done.\\n\\xa0He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:  1.\\n\\xa0Here a captive heart busted.\\n2.\\n\\xa0Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life.\\n3.\\n\\xa0Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity.\\n4.\\n\\xa0Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.\\nTom\\'s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.\\nWhen he got done he couldn\\'t no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on.\\n\\xa0Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn\\'t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn\\'t have nothing to do but just follow the lines.\\n\\xa0Then pretty soon he says:  \"Come to think, the logs ain\\'t a-going to do; they don\\'t have log walls in a dungeon: \\xa0we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.\\n\\xa0We\\'ll fetch a rock.\"\\nJim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn\\'t ever get out.\\n\\xa0But Tom said he would let me help him do it.\\n\\xa0Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens.\\n\\xa0It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn\\'t give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn\\'t seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says:  \"I know how to fix it.\\n\\xa0We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.\\nThere\\'s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we\\'ll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too.\"\\nIt warn\\'t no slouch of an idea; and it warn\\'t no slouch of a grindstone nuther; but we allowed we\\'d tackle it.\\n\\xa0It warn\\'t quite midnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.\\n\\xa0We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough job.\\nSometimes, do what we could, we couldn\\'t keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.\\n\\xa0Tom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.\\n\\xa0We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.\\n\\xa0We see it warn\\'t no use; we got to go and fetch Jim.\\nSo he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended.\\n\\xa0He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.\\n\\xa0He knowed how to do everything.\\nOur hole was pretty big, but it warn\\'t big enough to get the grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.\\n\\xa0Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it.\\n\\xa0Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.\\n\\xa0But Tom thought of something, and says:  \"You got any spiders in here, Jim?\"\\n\"No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain\\'t, Mars Tom.\"\\n\"All right, we\\'ll get you some.\"\\n\"But bless you, honey, I doan\\' _want_ none.\\n\\xa0I\\'s afeard un um.\\n\\xa0I jis\\' \\'s soon have rattlesnakes aroun\\'.\"\\nTom thought a minute or two, and says:  \"It\\'s a good idea.\\n\\xa0And I reckon it\\'s been done.\\n\\xa0It _must_ a been done; it stands to reason.\\n\\xa0Yes, it\\'s a prime good idea.\\n\\xa0Where could you keep it?\"\\n\"Keep what, Mars Tom?\"\\n\"Why, a rattlesnake.\"\\n\"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!\\n\\xa0Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I\\'d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head.\"\\n\"Why, Jim, you wouldn\\'t be afraid of it after a little.\\n\\xa0You could tame it.\"\\n\"_Tame_ it.\"\\n\"Yes easy enough.\\n\\xa0Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting, and they wouldn\\'t _think_ of hurting a person that pets them.\\n\\xa0Any book will tell you that.\\n\\xa0You try that\\'s all I ask; just try for two or three days.\\nWhy, you can get him so, in a little while, that he\\'ll love you; and sleep with you; and won\\'t stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.\"\\n\"_Please_, Mars Tom _doan_\\' talk so!\\n\\xa0I can\\'t _stan_\\' it!\\n\\xa0He\\'d _let_ me shove his head in my mouf fer a favor, hain\\'t it?\\n\\xa0I lay he\\'d wait a pow\\'ful long time \\'fo\\' I _ast_ him.\\n\\xa0En mo\\' en dat, I doan\\' _want_ him to sleep wid me.\"\\n\"Jim, don\\'t act so foolish.\\n\\xa0A prisoner\\'s _got_ to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain\\'t ever been tried, why, there\\'s more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life.\"\\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I doan\\' _want_ no sich glory.\\n\\xa0Snake take \\'n bite Jim\\'s chin off, den _whah_ is de glory?\\n\\xa0No, sah, I doan\\' want no sich doin\\'s.\"\\n\"Blame it, can\\'t you _try_?\\n\\xa0I only _want_ you to try you needn\\'t keep it up if it don\\'t work.\"\\n\"But de trouble all _done_ ef de snake bite me while I\\'s a tryin\\' him.\\nMars Tom, I\\'s willin\\' to tackle mos\\' anything \\'at ain\\'t onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I\\'s gwyne to _leave_, dat\\'s _shore_.\"\\n\"Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you\\'re so bull-headed about it.\\n\\xa0We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and let on they\\'re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that \\'ll have to do.\"\\n\"I k\\'n stan\\' _dem_, Mars Tom, but blame\\' \\'f I couldn\\' get along widout um, I tell you dat.\\n\\xa0I never knowed b\\'fo\\' \\'t was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner.\"\\n\"Well, it _always_ is when it\\'s done right.\\n\\xa0You got any rats around here?\"\\n\"No, sah, I hain\\'t seed none.\"\\n\"Well, we\\'ll get you some rats.\"\\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I doan\\' _want_ no rats.\\n\\xa0Dey\\'s de dadblamedest creturs to \\'sturb a body, en rustle roun\\' over \\'im, en bite his feet, when he\\'s tryin\\' to sleep, I ever see.\\n\\xa0No, sah, gimme g\\'yarter-snakes, \\'f I\\'s got to have \\'m, but doan\\' gimme no rats; I hain\\' got no use f\\'r um, skasely.\"\\n\"But, Jim, you _got_ to have \\'em they all do.\\n\\xa0So don\\'t make no more fuss about it.\\n\\xa0Prisoners ain\\'t ever without rats.\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t no instance of it.\\n\\xa0And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.\\n\\xa0But you got to play music to them.\\n\\xa0You got anything to play music on?\"\\n\"I ain\\' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o\\' paper, en a juice-harp; but I reck\\'n dey wouldn\\' take no stock in a juice-harp.\"\\n\"Yes they would\\xa0_they_ don\\'t care what kind of music \\'tis.\\n\\xa0A jews-harp\\'s plenty good enough for a rat.\\n\\xa0All animals like music in a prison they dote on it.\\n\\xa0Specially, painful music; and you can\\'t get no other kind out of a jews-harp.\\n\\xa0It always interests them; they come out to see what\\'s the matter with you.\\n\\xa0Yes, you\\'re all right; you\\'re fixed very well.\\n\\xa0You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play \\'The Last Link is Broken\\' that\\'s the thing that \\'ll scoop a rat quicker \\'n anything else; and when you\\'ve played about two minutes you\\'ll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come.\\n\\xa0And they\\'ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.\"\\n\"Yes, _dey_ will, I reck\\'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is _Jim_ havin\\'?\\nBlest if I kin see de pint.\\n\\xa0But I\\'ll do it ef I got to.\\n\\xa0I reck\\'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.\"\\nTom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn\\'t nothing else; and pretty soon he says:  \"Oh, there\\'s one thing I forgot.\\n\\xa0Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?\"\\n\"I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it\\'s tolable dark in heah, en I ain\\' got no use f\\'r no flower, nohow, en she\\'d be a pow\\'ful sight o\\' trouble.\"\\n\"Well, you try it, anyway.\\n\\xa0Some other prisoners has done it.\"\\n\"One er dem big cat-tail-lookin\\' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars Tom, I reck\\'n, but she wouldn\\'t be wuth half de trouble she\\'d coss.\"\\n\"Don\\'t you believe it.\\n\\xa0We\\'ll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it.\\n\\xa0And don\\'t call it mullen, call it Pitchiola that\\'s its right name when it\\'s in a prison.\\n\\xa0And you want to water it with your tears.\"\\n\"Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.\"\\n\"You don\\'t _want_ spring water; you want to water it with your tears.\\n\\xa0It\\'s the way they always do.\"\\n\"Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man\\'s a _start\\'n_ one wid tears.\"\\n\"That ain\\'t the idea.\\n\\xa0You _got_ to do it with tears.\"\\n\"She\\'ll die on my han\\'s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan\\' skasely ever cry.\"\\nSo Tom was stumped.\\n\\xa0But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion.\\n\\xa0He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim\\'s coffee-pot, in the morning.\\nJim said he would \"jis\\' \\'s soon have tobacker in his coffee.\"\\nand found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn\\'t know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him.\\n\\xa0So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn\\'t behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.\\nIN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally\\'s bed.\\n\\xa0But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her.\\n\\xa0So she took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn\\'t the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.\\n\\xa0I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.\\nWe got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet\\'s nest, but we didn\\'t.\\n\\xa0The family was at home.\\n\\xa0We didn\\'t give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we\\'d tire them out or they\\'d got to tire us out, and they done it.\\n\\xa0Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn\\'t set down convenient.\\n\\xa0And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day\\'s work: \\xa0and hungry?\\noh, no, I reckon not!\\n\\xa0And there warn\\'t a blessed snake up there when we went back we didn\\'t half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.\\n\\xa0But it didn\\'t matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.\\n\\xa0So we judged we could get some of them again.\\n\\xa0No, there warn\\'t no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.\\n\\xa0You\\'d see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn\\'t want them.\\n\\xa0Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn\\'t no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn\\'t stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn\\'t make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.\\n\\xa0I never see such a woman.\\n\\xa0And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.\\n\\xa0You couldn\\'t get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.\\n\\xa0And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire.\\n\\xa0She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn\\'t ever been no snakes created.\\n\\xa0Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn\\'t over it yet; she warn\\'t near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings.\\n\\xa0It was very curious.\\n\\xa0But Tom said all women was just so.\\n\\xa0He said they was made that way for some reason or other.\\nWe got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she allowed these lickings warn\\'t nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them.\\n\\xa0I didn\\'t mind the lickings, because they didn\\'t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot.\\n\\xa0But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim\\'s was when they\\'d all swarm out for music and go for him.\\n\\xa0Jim didn\\'t like the spiders, and the spiders didn\\'t like Jim; and so they\\'d lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him.\\n\\xa0And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn\\'t no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn\\'t sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t\\'other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over.\\nHe said if he ever got out this time he wouldn\\'t ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.\\nWell, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.\\n\\xa0The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.\\n\\xa0We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn\\'t.\\n\\xa0It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same.\\nBut as I was saying, we\\'d got all the work done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.\\n\\xa0The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn\\'t got no answer, because there warn\\'t no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St.\\nLouis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St.\\nLouis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn\\'t no time to lose.\\nSo Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.\\n\"What\\'s them?\"\\n\\xa0I says.\\n\"Warnings to the people that something is up.\\n\\xa0Sometimes it\\'s done one way, sometimes another.\\n\\xa0But there\\'s always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle.\\n\\xa0When Louis XVI.\\nwas going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.\\n\\xa0It\\'s a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters.\\n\\xa0We\\'ll use them both.\\n\\xa0And it\\'s usual for the prisoner\\'s mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.\\n\\xa0We\\'ll do that, too.\"\\n\"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that something\\'s up?\\n\\xa0Let them find it out for themselves it\\'s their lookout.\"\\n\"Yes, I know; but you can\\'t depend on them.\\n\\xa0It\\'s the way they\\'ve acted from the very start left us to do _everything_.\\n\\xa0They\\'re so confiding and mullet-headed they don\\'t take notice of nothing at all.\\n\\xa0So if we don\\'t _give_ them notice there won\\'t be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape \\'ll go off perfectly flat; won\\'t amount to nothing won\\'t be nothing _to_ it.\"\\n\"Well, as for me, Tom, that\\'s the way I\\'d like.\"\\n\"Shucks.\"\\nhe says, and looked disgusted.\\n\\xa0So I says:  \"But I ain\\'t going to make no complaint.\\n\\xa0Any way that suits you suits me.\\nWhat you going to do about the servant-girl?\"\\n\"You\\'ll be her.\\n\\xa0You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that yaller girl\\'s frock.\"\\n\"Why, Tom, that \\'ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she prob\\'bly hain\\'t got any but that one.\"\\n\"I know; but you don\\'t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.\"\\n\"All right, then, I\\'ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs.\"\\n\"You wouldn\\'t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?\"\\n\"No, but there won\\'t be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.\"\\n\"That ain\\'t got nothing to do with it.\\n\\xa0The thing for us to do is just to do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it or not.\\nHain\\'t you got no principle at all?\"\\n\"All right, I ain\\'t saying nothing; I\\'m the servant-girl.\\n\\xa0Who\\'s Jim\\'s mother?\"\\n\"I\\'m his mother.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.\"\\n\"Well, then, you\\'ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.\"\\n\"Not much.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll stuff Jim\\'s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim \\'ll take the nigger woman\\'s gown off of me and wear it, and we\\'ll all evade together.\\n\\xa0When a prisoner of style escapes it\\'s called an evasion.\\n\\xa0It\\'s always called so when a king escapes, f\\'rinstance.\\n\\xa0And the same with a king\\'s son; it don\\'t make no difference whether he\\'s a natural one or an unnatural one.\"\\nSo Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench\\'s frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the way Tom told me to.\\n\\xa0It said:  Beware.\\n\\xa0Trouble is brewing.\\n\\xa0Keep a sharp lookout.\\n_Unknown_ _Friend_.\\nNext night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door.\\n\\xa0I never see a family in such a sweat.\\n\\xa0They couldn\\'t a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.\\n\\xa0If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said \"ouch.\"\\nif anything fell, she jumped and said \"ouch.\"\\nif you happened to touch her, when she warn\\'t noticing, she done the same; she couldn\\'t face noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every time so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying \"ouch.\"\\nand before she\\'d got two-thirds around she\\'d whirl back again, and say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn\\'t set up.\\n\\xa0So the thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory.\\nHe said it showed it was done right.\\nSo he said, now for the grand bulge!\\n\\xa0So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.\\n\\xa0Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.\\n\\xa0This letter said:  Don\\'t betray me, I wish to be your friend.\\n\\xa0There is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them.\\n\\xa0I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and will betray the helish design.\\nThey will sneak down from northards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger\\'s cabin to get him.\\nI am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo.\\nI do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing.\\nWE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn\\'t know which end they was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn\\'t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word about the new letter, but didn\\'t need to, because we knowed as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally\\'s dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch, but says:  \"Where\\'s the butter?\"\\n\"I laid out a hunk of it.\"\\nI says, \"on a piece of a corn-pone.\"\\n\"Well, you _left_ it laid out, then it ain\\'t here.\"\\n\"We can get along without it.\"\\nI says.\\n\"We can get along _with_ it, too.\"\\nhe says; \"just you slide down cellar and fetch it.\\n\\xa0And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along.\\nI\\'ll go and stuff the straw into Jim\\'s clothes to represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to _baa_ like a sheep and shove soon as you get there.\"\\nSo out he went, and down cellar went I.\\nThe hunk of butter, big as a person\\'s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:  \"You been down cellar?\"\\n\"Yes\\'m.\"\\n\"What you been doing down there?\"\\n\"Noth\\'n.\"\\n\"_Noth\\'n!.\"\\n\"No\\'m.\"\\n\"Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know \\'m.\"\\n\"You don\\'t _know_?\\n\\xa0Don\\'t answer me that way.\\nTom, I want to know what you been _doing_ down there.\"\\n\"I hain\\'t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I have.\"\\nI reckoned she\\'d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I s\\'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn\\'t yard-stick straight; so she says, very decided:  \"You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.\\n\\xa0You been up to something you no business to, and I lay I\\'ll find out what it is before I\\'M done with you.\"\\nSo she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.\\nMy, but there was a crowd there!\\n\\xa0Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had a gun.\\n\\xa0I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.\\nThey was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn\\'t; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their buttons.\\n\\xa0I warn\\'t easy myself, but I didn\\'t take my hat off, all the same.\\nI did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we\\'d overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet\\'s-nest we\\'d got ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us.\\nAt last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn\\'t_ answer them straight, I didn\\'t know which end of me was up; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn\\'t but a few minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, \"I\\'M for going and getting in the cabin _first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come.\"\\nI most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:  \"For the land\\'s sake, what _is_ the matter with the child?\\n\\xa0He\\'s got the brain-fever as shore as you\\'re born, and they\\'re oozing out.\"\\nAnd everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me, and says:  \"Oh, what a turn you did give me!\\nand how glad and grateful I am it ain\\'t no worse; for luck\\'s against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when I see that truck I thought we\\'d lost you, for I knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if Dear, dear, whyd\\'nt you _tell_ me that was what you\\'d been down there for, I wouldn\\'t a cared.\\n\\xa0Now cler out to bed, and don\\'t lemme see no more of you till morning.\"\\nI was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose the house full of men, yonder, with guns!\\nHis eyes just blazed; and he says:  \"No!\\nis that so?\\n\\xa0_ain\\'t_ it bully!\\n\\xa0Why, Huck, if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred!\\n\\xa0If we could put it off till.\"\\n\"Hurry!\\n\\xa0_Hurry_.\"\\n\\xa0I says.\\n\\xa0\"Where\\'s Jim?\"\\n\"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.\\n\\xa0He\\'s dressed, and everything\\'s ready.\\n\\xa0Now we\\'ll slide out and give the sheep-signal.\"\\nBut then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:  \"I _told_ you we\\'d be too soon; they haven\\'t come the door is locked.\\nHere, I\\'ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for \\'em in the dark and kill \\'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear \\'em coming.\"\\nSo in they come, but couldn\\'t see us in the dark, and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.\\n\\xa0But we got under all right, and out through the hole, swift but soft Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according to Tom\\'s orders.\\n\\xa0Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.\\n\\xa0So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn\\'t make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first, and him last.\\n\\xa0So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom\\'s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out:  \"Who\\'s that?\\n\\xa0Answer, or I\\'ll shoot.\"\\nBut we didn\\'t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.\\n\\xa0Then there was a rush, and a _Bang, Bang, Bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzed around us!\\nWe heard them sing out:  \"Here they are!\\n\\xa0They\\'ve broke for the river!\\n\\xa0After \\'em, boys, and turn loose the dogs.\"\\nSo here they come, full tilt.\\n\\xa0We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled, but we didn\\'t wear no boots and didn\\'t yell.\\n\\xa0We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them.\\n\\xa0They\\'d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn\\'t scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn\\'t nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn\\'t make no more noise than we was obleeged to.\\nThen we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.\\n\\xa0And when we stepped on to the raft I says:  \"_Now_, old Jim, you\\'re a free man again, and I bet you won\\'t ever be a slave no more.\"\\n\"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.\\n\\xa0It \\'uz planned beautiful, en it \\'uz done beautiful; en dey ain\\'t _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat\\'s mo\\' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.\"\\nWe was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.\\nWhen me and Jim heard that we didn\\'t feel so brash as what we did before.\\nIt was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke\\'s shirts for to bandage him, but he says:  \"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.\\n\\xa0Don\\'t stop now; don\\'t fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set her loose!\\n\\xa0Boys, we done it elegant!\\n\\'deed we did.\\n\\xa0I wish _we\\'d_ a had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn\\'t a been no \\'Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!\\' wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we\\'d a whooped him over the _border_ that\\'s what we\\'d a done with _him_ and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too.\\n\\xa0Man the sweeps man the sweeps.\"\\nBut me and Jim was consulting and thinking.\\n\\xa0And after we\\'d thought a minute, I says:  \"Say it, Jim.\"\\nSo he says:  \"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.\\n\\xa0Ef it wuz _him_ dat \\'uz bein\\' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, \\'Go on en save me, nemmine \\'bout a doctor f\\'r to save dis one?\\' \\xa0Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer?\\n\\xa0Would he say dat?\\n\\xa0You _bet_ he wouldn\\'t!\\n\\xa0_well_, den, is _Jim_ gywne to say it?\\n\\xa0No, sah I doan\\' budge a step out\\'n dis place \\'dout a _doctor_, not if it\\'s forty year.\"\\nI knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he\\'d say what he did say so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.\\n\\xa0He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn\\'t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn\\'t let him.\\n\\xa0Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it didn\\'t do no good.\\nSo when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:  \"Well, then, if you\\'re bound to go, I\\'ll tell you the way to do when you get to the village.\\n\\xa0Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away from him, and don\\'t give it back to him till you get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again.\\nIt\\'s the way they all do.\"\\nSo I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again.\\nTHE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got him up.\\n\\xa0I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks.\\n\"Who is your folks?\"\\nhe says.\\n\"The Phelpses, down yonder.\"\\n\"Oh.\"\\nhe says.\\n\\xa0And after a minute, he says:  \"How\\'d you say he got shot?\"\\n\"He had a dream.\"\\nI says, \"and it shot him.\"\\n\"Singular dream.\"\\nhe says.\\nSo he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.\\n\\xa0But when he sees the canoe he didn\\'t like the look of her said she was big enough for one, but didn\\'t look pretty safe for two.\\n\\xa0I says:  \"Oh, you needn\\'t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy enough.\"\\n\"What three?\"\\n\"Why, me and Sid, and and and _the guns_; that\\'s what I mean.\"\\n\"Oh.\"\\nhe says.\\nBut he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and said he reckoned he\\'d look around for a bigger one.\\n\\xa0But they was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.\\n\\xa0But I said I didn\\'t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started.\\nI struck an idea pretty soon.\\n\\xa0I says to myself, spos\\'n he can\\'t fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep\\'s tail, as the saying is?\\nspos\\'n it takes him three or four days?\\n\\xa0What are we going to do?\\nlay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?\\n\\xa0No, sir; I know what _I\\'ll_ do.\\n\\xa0I\\'ll wait, and when he comes back if he says he\\'s got to go any more I\\'ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we\\'ll take and tie him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom\\'s done with him we\\'ll give him what it\\'s worth, or all we got, and then let him get ashore.\\nSo then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head!\\n\\xa0I shot out and went for the doctor\\'s house, but they told me he\\'d gone away in the night some time or other, and warn\\'t back yet.\\n\\xa0Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I\\'ll dig out for the island right off.\\n\\xa0So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas\\'s stomach!\\nHe says:  \"Why, _Tom!_ \\xa0Where you been all this time, you rascal?\"\\n\"I hain\\'t been nowheres.\"\\nI says, \"only just hunting for the runaway nigger me and Sid.\"\\n\"Why, where ever did you go?\"\\nhe says.\\n\\xa0\"Your aunt\\'s been mighty uneasy.\"\\n\"She needn\\'t.\"\\nI says, \"because we was all right.\\n\\xa0We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn\\'t find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid\\'s at the post-office to see what he can hear, and I\\'m a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we\\'re going home.\"\\nSo then we went to the post-office to get \"Sid\"; but just as I suspicioned, he warn\\'t there; so the old man he got a letter out of the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn\\'t come; so the old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done fooling around but we would ride.\\n\\xa0I couldn\\'t get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn\\'t no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.\\nWhen we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don\\'t amount to shucks, and said she\\'d serve Sid the same when he come.\\nAnd the place was plum full of farmers and farmers\\' wives, to dinner; and such another clack a body never heard.\\n\\xa0Old Mrs.\\nHotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a-going all the time.\\n\\xa0She says:  \"Well, Sister Phelps, I\\'ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an\\' I b\\'lieve the nigger was crazy.\\n\\xa0I says to Sister Damrell didn\\'t I, Sister Damrell?\\ns\\'I, he\\'s crazy, s\\'I them\\'s the very words I said.\\n\\xa0You all hearn me: he\\'s crazy, s\\'I;

and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools _us_ but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_ with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time!\\n\\xa0I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever _heard_ of.\\nWhy, _sperits_ couldn\\'t a done better and been no smarter.\\nAnd I reckon they must a _been_ sperits because, _you_ know our dogs, and ther\\' ain\\'t no better; well, them dogs never even got on the _track_ of \\'m once!\\n\\xa0You explain _that_ to me if you can!\\n_any_ of you.\"\\n\"Well, it does beat.\"\\n\"Laws alive, I never.\"\\n\"So help me, I wouldn\\'t a be.\"\\n\"_House_-thieves as well as.\"\\n\"Goodnessgracioussakes, I\\'d a ben afeard to live in sich a.\"\\n\"\\'Fraid to _live_!\\nwhy, I was that scared I dasn\\'t hardly go to bed, or get up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway.\\n\\xa0Why, they\\'d steal the very why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night.\\n\\xa0I hope to gracious if I warn\\'t afraid they\\'d steal some o\\' the family!\\n\\xa0I was just to that pass I didn\\'t have no reasoning faculties no more.\\n\\xa0It looks foolish enough _now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there\\'s my two poor boys asleep, \\'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy \\'t I crep\\' up there and locked \\'em in!\\n\\xa0I _did_.\\n\\xa0And anybody would.\\nBecause, you know, when you get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o\\' wild things, and by and by you think to yourself, spos\\'n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain\\'t locked, and you.\"\\nShe stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit on me I got up and took a walk.\\nSays I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.\\n\\xa0So I done it.\\n\\xa0But I dasn\\'t go fur, or she\\'d a sent for me.\\n\\xa0And when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and \"Sid.\"\\nand the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn\\'t never want to try _that_ no more.\\n\\xa0And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before; and then she said she\\'d forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn\\'t come of it, she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done.\\n\\xa0So then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:  \"Why, lawsamercy, it\\'s most night, and Sid not come yet!\\n\\xa0What _has_ become of that boy?\"\\nI see my chance; so I skips up and says:  \"I\\'ll run right up to town and get him.\"\\nI says.\\n\"No you won\\'t.\"\\nshe says.\\n\\xa0\"You\\'ll stay right wher\\' you are; _one\\'s_ enough to be lost at a time.\\n\\xa0If he ain\\'t here to supper, your uncle \\'ll go.\"\\nWell, he warn\\'t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.\\nHe come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn\\'t run across Tom\\'s track.\\nAunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn\\'t no occasion to be boys will be boys, he said, and you\\'ll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.\\n\\xa0So she had to be satisfied.\\n\\xa0But she said she\\'d set up for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could see it.\\nAnd then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn\\'t look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn\\'t seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much trouble.\\n\\xa0And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:  \"The door ain\\'t going to be locked, Tom, and there\\'s the window and the rod; but you\\'ll be good, _won\\'t_ you?\\n\\xa0And you won\\'t go?\\n\\xa0For _my_ sake.\"\\nLaws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all intending to go; but after that I wouldn\\'t a went, not for kingdoms.\\nBut she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.\\nAnd twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something for her, but I couldn\\'t, only to swear that I wouldn\\'t never do nothing to grieve her any more.\\n\\xa0And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.\\nTHE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn\\'t get no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything.\\nAnd by and by the old man says:  \"Did I give you the letter?\"\\n\"What letter?\"\\n\"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.\"\\n\"No, you didn\\'t give me no letter.\"\\n\"Well, I must a forgot it.\"\\nSo he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.\\n\\xa0She says:  \"Why, it\\'s from St.\\nPetersburg it\\'s from Sis.\"\\nI allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn\\'t stir.\\n\\xa0But before she could break it open she dropped it and run for she see something.\\nAnd so did I.\\nIt was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people.\\n\\xa0I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed.\\n\\xa0She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:  \"Oh, he\\'s dead, he\\'s dead, I know he\\'s dead.\"\\nAnd Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other, which showed he warn\\'t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands, and says:  \"He\\'s alive, thank God!\\n\\xa0And that\\'s enough.\"\\nand she snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the way.\\nI followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.\\n\\xa0The men was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn\\'t be trying to run away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights.\\n\\xa0But the others said, don\\'t do it, it wouldn\\'t answer at all; he ain\\'t our nigger, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.\\n\\xa0So that cooled them down a little, because the people that\\'s always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain\\'t done just right is always the very ones that ain\\'t the most anxious to pay for him when they\\'ve got their satisfaction out of him.\\nThey cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and said he warn\\'t to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn\\'t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says:  \"Don\\'t be no rougher on him than you\\'re obleeged to, because he ain\\'t a bad nigger.\\n\\xa0When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn\\'t cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn\\'t in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn\\'t let me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he\\'d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn\\'t do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he\\'ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.\\n\\xa0Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was_!\\nand there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.\\n\\xa0It was a fix, I tell you!\\nI had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I\\'d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn\\'t, because the nigger might get away, and then I\\'d be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.\\n\\xa0So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he\\'d been worked main hard lately.\\n\\xa0I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars and kind treatment, too.\\n\\xa0I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I _was_, with both of \\'m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble.\\nAnd the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start.\\n\\xa0He ain\\'t no bad nigger, gentlemen; that\\'s what I think about him.\"\\nSomebody says:  \"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I\\'m obleeged to say.\"\\nThen the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.\\n\\xa0Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward.\\n\\xa0So every one of them promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn\\'t cuss him no more.\\nThen they come out and locked him up.\\n\\xa0I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they didn\\'t think of it, and I reckoned it warn\\'t best for me to mix in, but I judged I\\'d get the doctor\\'s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I\\'d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.\\nBut I had plenty time.\\n\\xa0Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him.\\nNext morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap.\\n\\xa0So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash.\\nBut he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.\\n\\xa0So I set down and laid for him to wake.\\n\\xa0In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump again!\\n\\xa0She motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he\\'d been sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he\\'d wake up in his right mind.\\nSo we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:  \"Hello!\\nwhy, I\\'m at _home_!\\n\\xa0How\\'s that?\\n\\xa0Where\\'s the raft?\"\\n\"It\\'s all right.\"\\nI says.\\n\"And _Jim_?\"\\n\"The same.\"\\nI says, but couldn\\'t say it pretty brash.\\n\\xa0But he never noticed, but says:  \"Good!\\n\\xa0Splendid!\\n\\xa0_Now_ we\\'re all right and safe!\\nDid you tell Aunty?\"\\nI was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: \\xa0\"About what, Sid?\"\\n\"Why, about the way the whole thing was done.\"\\n\"What whole thing?\"\\n\"Why, _the_ whole thing.\\n\\xa0There ain\\'t but one; how we set the runaway nigger free me and Tom.\"\\n\"Good land!\\n\\xa0Set the run What _is_ the child talking about!\\n\\xa0Dear, dear, out of his head again.\"\\n\"_No_, I ain\\'t out of my _head_; I know all what I\\'m talking about.\\n\\xa0We _did_ set him free me and Tom.\\n\\xa0We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.\\n\\xa0And we done it elegant, too.\"\\n\\xa0He\\'d got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn\\'t no use for _me_ to put in.\\n\\xa0\"Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work weeks of it hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep.\\nAnd we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can\\'t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can\\'t think _half_ the fun it was.\\n\\xa0And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket.\"\\n\"Mercy sakes.\"\\n.\"\\nand load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn\\'t interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and _wasn\\'t_ it bully, Aunty.\"\\n\"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!\\n\\xa0So it was _you_, you little rapscallions, that\\'s been making all this trouble, and turned everybody\\'s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death.\\n\\xa0I\\'ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o\\' you this very minute.\\n\\xa0To think, here I\\'ve been, night after night, a _you_ just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I\\'ll tan the Old Harry out o\\' both o\\' ye.\"\\nBut Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn\\'t_ hold in, and his tongue just _went_ it she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she says:  \"_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again.\"\\n\"Meddling with _who_?\"\\n\\xa0Tom says, dropping his smile and looking surprised.\\n\"With _who_?\\n\\xa0Why, the runaway nigger, of course.\\n\\xa0Who\\'d you reckon?\"\\nTom looks at me very grave, and says:  \"Tom, didn\\'t you just tell me he was all right?\\n\\xa0Hasn\\'t he got away?\"\\n\"_Him_?\"\\nsays Aunt Sally; \"the runaway nigger?\\n\\xa0\\'Deed he hasn\\'t.\\n\\xa0They\\'ve got him back, safe and sound, and he\\'s in that cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he\\'s claimed or sold.\"\\nTom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:  \"They hain\\'t no _right_ to shut him up!\\n\\xa0SHOVE!\\nand don\\'t you lose a minute.\\n\\xa0Turn him loose!\\nhe ain\\'t no slave; he\\'s as free as any cretur that walks this earth.\"\\n\"What _does_ the child mean?\"\\n\"I mean every word I _say_, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don\\'t go, _I\\'ll_ go.\\nI\\'ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.\\n\\xa0Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her will.\"\\n\"Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was already free?\"\\n\"Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and just like women!\\n\\xa0Why, I wanted the _adventure_ of it; and I\\'d a waded neck-deep in blood to goodness alive, _Aunt Polly!.\"\\nIf she warn\\'t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!\\nAunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.\\n\\xa0And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom\\'s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles kind of grinding him into the earth, you know.\\n\\xa0And then she says:  \"Yes, you _better_ turn y\\'r head away I would if I was you, Tom.\"\\n\"Oh, deary me.\"\\nsays Aunt Sally; \"_Is_ he changed so?\\n\\xa0Why, that ain\\'t _Tom_, it\\'s Sid; Tom\\'s Tom\\'s why, where is Tom?\\n\\xa0He was here a minute ago.\"\\n\"You mean where\\'s Huck _Finn_ that\\'s what you mean!\\n\\xa0I reckon I hain\\'t raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I _see_ him.\\n\\xa0That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do.\\nCome out from under that bed, Huck Finn.\"\\nSo I done it.\\n\\xa0But not feeling brash.\\nAunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to him.\\n\\xa0It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn\\'t know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn\\'t a understood it.\\n\\xa0So Tom\\'s Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs.\\nPhelps took me for Tom Sawyer she chipped in and says, \"Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I\\'m used to it now, and \\'tain\\'t no need to chang.\"\\nthat when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it there warn\\'t no other way, and I knowed he wouldn\\'t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he\\'d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied.\\n\\xa0And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.\\nAnd his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free!\\nand I couldn\\'t ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_ help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.\\nWell, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and _Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:  \"Look at that, now!\\n\\xa0I might have expected it, letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him.\\n\\xa0So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur\\'s up to _this_ time, as long as I couldn\\'t seem to get any answer out of you about it.\"\\n\"Why, I never heard nothing from you.\"\\nsays Aunt Sally.\\n\"Well, I wonder!\\n\\xa0Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here.\"\\n\"Well, I never got \\'em, Sis.\"\\nAunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:  \"You, Tom.\"\\n\"Well _what_?\"\\nhe says, kind of pettish.\\n\"Don\\'t you what _me_, you impudent thing hand out them letters.\"\\n\"What letters?\"\\n\"_Them_ letters.\\n\\xa0I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I\\'ll.\"\\n\"They\\'re in the trunk.\\n\\xa0There, now.\\n\\xa0And they\\'re just the same as they was when I got them out of the office.\\n\\xa0I hain\\'t looked into them, I hain\\'t touched them.\\n\\xa0But I knowed they\\'d make trouble, and I thought if you warn\\'t in no hurry, I\\'d.\"\\n\"Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain\\'t no mistake about it.\\n\\xa0And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s\\'pose he.\"\\n\"No, it come yesterday; I hain\\'t read it yet, but _it\\'s_ all right, I\\'ve got that one.\"\\nI wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn\\'t, but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to.\\n\\xa0So I never said nothing.\\nwhat it was he\\'d planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?\\nAnd he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we.\\n\\xa0But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.\\nWe had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.\\n\\xa0And we had him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:  \"Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?\\nwhat I tell you up dah on Jackson islan\\'?\\n\\xa0I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas\\', en what\\'s de sign un it; en I _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin_; en it\\'s come true; en heah she is!\\n\\xa0_dah_, now!\\ndoan\\' talk to _me_ signs is _signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis\\' \\'s well \\'at I \\'uz gwineter be rich agin as I\\'s a-stannin\\' heah dis minute.\"\\nAnd then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le\\'s all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain\\'t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn\\'t get none from home, because it\\'s likely pap\\'s been back before now, and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.\\n\"No, he hain\\'t.\"\\nTom says; \"it\\'s all there yet six thousand dollars and more; and your pap hain\\'t ever been back since.\\n\\xa0Hadn\\'t when I come away, anyhow.\"\\nJim says, kind of solemn:  \"He ain\\'t a-comin\\' back no mo\\', Huck.\"\\nI says:  \"Why, Jim?\"\\n\"Nemmine why, Huck but he ain\\'t comin\\' back no mo.\"\\nBut I kept at him; so at last he says:  \"Doan\\' you \\'member de house dat was float\\'n down de river, en dey wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn\\' let you come in?\\n\\xa0Well, den, you kin git yo\\' money when you wants it, kase dat wuz him.\"\\nTom\\'s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain\\'t nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I\\'d a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn\\'t a tackled it, and ain\\'t a-going to no more.\\n\\xa0But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she\\'s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can\\'t stand it.\\n\\xa0I been there before.\\nTHE END.\\nYOURS TRULY, _HUCK FINN_.\\n\\nDown the Rabbit-Hole  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \\'and what is the use of a book,\\' thought Alice \\'without pictures or conversations?\\'\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\\nThere was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \\'Oh dear!\\nOh dear!\\nI shall be late!\\' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.\\nFirst, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.\\nShe took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \\'ORANGE MARMALADE\\', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\\n\\'Well!\\' thought Alice to herself, \\'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!\\nHow brave they\\'ll all think me at home!\\nWhy, I wouldn\\'t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\\' (Which was very likely true.)  Down, down, down.\\nWould the fall NEVER come to an end!\\n\\'I wonder how many miles I\\'ve fallen by this time?\\' she said aloud.\\n\\'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.\\nLet me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--\\' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \\'--yes, that\\'s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\\'ve got to?\\' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)  Presently she began again.\\n\\'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth!\\nHow funny it\\'ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!\\nThe Antipathies, I think--\\' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn\\'t sound at all the right word) \\'--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\\nPlease, Ma\\'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\\' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you\\'re falling through the air!\\nDo you think you could manage it?) \\'And what an ignorant little girl she\\'ll think me for asking!\\nNo, it\\'ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\\'\\nDown, down, down.\\nThere was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.\\n\\'Dinah\\'ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\\' (Dinah was the cat.) \\'I hope they\\'ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.\\nDinah my dear!\\nI wish you were down here with me!\\nThere are no mice in the air, I\\'m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\\'s very like a mouse, you know.\\nBut do cats eat bats, I wonder?\\' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \\'Do cats eat bats?\\nDo cats eat bats?\\' and sometimes, \\'Do bats eat cats?\\' for, you see, as she couldn\\'t answer either question, it didn\\'t much matter which way she put it.\\nShe felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \\'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\\' when suddenly, thump!\\nthump!\\ndown she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.\\nThere was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \\'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it\\'s getting!\\' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\\'s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!\\neither the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.\\nHowever, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \\'and even if my head would go through,\\' thought poor Alice, \\'it would be of very little use without my shoulders.\\nOh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!\\nI think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\\' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\\'which certainly was not here before,\\' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \\'DRINK ME\\' beautifully printed on it in large letters.\\nIt was all very well to say \\'Drink me,\\' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.\\n\\'No, I\\'ll look first,\\' she said, \\'and see whether it\\'s marked \"poiso.\"\\nor not\\'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \\'poison,\\' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\\nHowever, this bottle was NOT marked \\'poison,\\' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  \\'What a curious feeling!\\' said Alice; \\'I must be shutting up like a telescope.\\'\\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.\\nFirst, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \\'for it might end, you know,\\' said Alice to herself, \\'in my going out altogether, like a candle.\\nI wonder what I should be like then?\\' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!\\nwhen she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\\n\\'Come, there\\'s no use in crying like that!\\' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \\'I advise you to leave off this minute!\\' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\n\\'But it\\'s no use now,\\' thought poor Alice, \\'to pretend to be two people!\\nWhy, there\\'s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!\\'\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \\'EAT ME\\' were beautifully marked in currants.\\n\\'Well, I\\'ll eat it,\\' said Alice, \\'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\\'ll get into the garden, and I don\\'t care which happens!\\'\\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \\'Which way?\\nWhich way?\\', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\nThe Pool of Tears  \\'Curiouser and curiouser!\\' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \\'now I\\'m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!\\nGood-bye, feet!\\' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).\\n\\'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?\\nI\\'m sure _I_ shan\\'t be able!\\nI shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them,\\' thought Alice, \\'or perhaps they won\\'t walk the way I want to go!\\nLet me see: I\\'ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\\'\\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.\\n\\'They must go by the carrier,\\' she thought; \\'and how funny it\\'ll seem, sending presents to one\\'s own feet!\\nAnd how odd the directions will look!\\nALICE\\'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\\nHEARTHRUG,          NEAR THE FENDER,            (WITH ALICE\\'S LOVE).\\nOh dear, what nonsense I\\'m talking!\\'\\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\\nPoor Alice!\\nIt was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\\n\\'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\\' said Alice, \\'a great girl like you,\\' (she might well say this), \\'to go on crying in this way!\\nStop this moment, I tell you!\\' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.\\nIt was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \\'Oh!\\nthe Duchess, the Duchess!\\nOh!\\nwon\\'t she be savage if I\\'ve kept her waiting!\\' Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \\'If you please, sir--\\' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \\'Dear, dear!\\nHow queer everything is to-day!\\nAnd yesterday things went on just as usual.\\nI wonder if I\\'ve been changed in the night?\\nLet me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?\\nI almost think I can remember feeling a little different.\\nBut if I\\'m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?\\nAh, THAT\\'S the great puzzle!\\' And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\n\\'I\\'m sure I\\'m not Ada,\\' she said, \\'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\\'t go in ringlets at all; and I\\'m sure I can\\'t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!\\nshe knows such a very little!\\nBesides, SHE\\'S she, and I\\'m I, and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!\\nI\\'ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!\\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate!\\nHowever, the Multiplication Table doesn\\'t signify: let\\'s try Geography.\\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no, THAT\\'S all wrong, I\\'m certain!\\nI must have been changed for Mabel!\\nI\\'ll try and say \"How doth the little--\"\\' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--       \\'How doth the little crocodile       Improve his shining tail,      And pour the waters of the Nile       On every golden scale!\\n\\'How cheerfully he seems to grin,       How neatly spread his claws,      And welcome little fishes in       With gently smiling jaws!\\'\\n\\'I\\'m sure those are not the right words,\\' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \\'I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh!\\never so many lessons to learn!\\nNo, I\\'ve made up my mind about it; if I\\'m Mabel, I\\'ll stay down here!\\nIt\\'ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \"Come up again, dear.\"\\nI shall only look up and say \"Who am I then?\\nTell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\\'ll come up: if not, I\\'ll stay down here till I\\'m somebody else\"--but, oh dear!\\' cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \\'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down!\\nI am so VERY tired of being all alone here!\\'\\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\\'s little white kid gloves while she was talking.\\n\\'How CAN I have done that?\\' she thought.\\n\\'I must be growing small again.\\' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\n\\'That WAS a narrow escape!\\' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \\'and now for the garden!\\' and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas!\\nthe little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \\'and things are worse than ever,\\' thought the poor child, \\'for I never was so small as this before, never!\\nAnd I declare it\\'s too bad, that it is!\\'\\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\\nshe was up to her chin in salt water.\\nHer first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \\'and in that case I can go back by railway,\\' she said to herself.\\n(Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\\n\\'I wish I hadn\\'t cried so much!\\' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.\\n\\'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!\\nThat WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!\\nHowever, everything is queer to-day.\\'\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\\n\\'Would it be of any use, now,\\' thought Alice, \\'to speak to this mouse?\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\\'s no harm in trying.\\' So she began: \\'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?\\nI am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\\' (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\\'s Latin Grammar, \\'A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!\\') The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\\n\\'Perhaps it doesn\\'t understand English,\\' thought Alice; \\'I daresay it\\'s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\\' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \\'Ou est ma chatte?\\' which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.\\nThe Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\\n\\'Oh, I beg your pardon!\\' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\\'s feelings.\\n\\'I quite forgot you didn\\'t like cats.\\'\\n\\'Not like cats!\\' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.\\n\\'Would YOU like cats if you were me?\\'\\n\\'Well, perhaps not,\\' said Alice in a soothing tone: \\'don\\'t be angry about it.\\nAnd yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\\'d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.\\nShe is such a dear quiet thing,\\' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \\'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she\\'s such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!\\' cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.\\n\\'We won\\'t talk about her any more if you\\'d rather not.\\'\\n\\'We indeed!\\' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.\\n\\'As if I would talk on such a subject!\\nOur family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!\\nDon\\'t let me hear the name again!\\'\\n\\'I won\\'t indeed!\\' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.\\n\\'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?\\' The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \\'There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!\\nA little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!\\nAnd it\\'ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\\'ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I can\\'t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\\'s so useful, it\\'s worth a hundred pounds!\\nHe says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!\\' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \\'I\\'m afraid I\\'ve offended it again!\\' For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\\nSo she called softly after it, \\'Mouse dear!\\nDo come back again, and we won\\'t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\\'t like them!\\' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \\'Let us get to the shore, and then I\\'ll tell you my history, and you\\'ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\\'\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.\\nAlice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.\\nIndeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \\'I am older than you, and must know better\\'; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \\'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!\\nI\\'LL soon make you dry enough!\\' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.\\nAlice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\\n\\'Ahem!\\' said the Mouse with an important air, \\'are you all ready?\\nThis is the driest thing I know.\\nSilence all round, if you please!\\n\"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.\\nEdwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--\"\\'\\n\\'Ugh!\\' said the Lory, with a shiver.\\n\\'I beg your pardon!\\' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \\'Did you speak?\\'\\n\\'Not I!\\' said the Lory hastily.\\n\\'I thought you did,\\' said the Mouse.\\n\\'--I proceed.\\n\"Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\"\\'\\n\\'Found WHAT?\\' said the Duck.\\n\\'Found IT,\\' the Mouse replied rather crossly: \\'of course you know what \"i.\"\\nmeans.\\'\\n\\'I know what \"i.\"\\nmeans well enough, when I find a thing,\\' said the Duck: \\'it\\'s generally a frog or a worm.\\nThe question is, what did the archbishop find?\\'\\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \\'\"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.\\nWilliam\\'s conduct at first was moderate.\\nBut the insolence of his Normans-.\"\\nHow are you getting on now, my dear?\\' it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\\n\\'As wet as ever,\\' said Alice in a melancholy tone: \\'it doesn\\'t seem to dry me at all.\\'\\n\\'In that case,\\' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \\'I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\\'\\n\\'Speak English!\\' said the Eaglet.\\n\\'I don\\'t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\\'s more, I don\\'t believe you do either!\\' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.\\n\\'What I was going to say,\\' said the Dodo in an offended tone, \\'was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\\'\\n\\'What IS a Caucus-race?\\' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\\n\\'Why,\\' said the Dodo, \\'the best way to explain it is to do it.\\' (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (\\'the exact shape doesn\\'t matter,\\' it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there.\\nThere was no \\'One, two, three, and away,\\' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.\\nHowever, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \\'The race is over!\\' and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \\'But who has won?\\'\\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.\\nAt last the Dodo said, \\'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.\\'\\n\\'But who is to give the prizes?\\' quite a chorus of voices asked.\\n\\'Why, SHE, of course,\\' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \\'Prizes!\\nPrizes!\\'\\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.\\nThere was exactly one a-piece all round.\\n\\'But she must have a prize herself, you know,\\' said the Mouse.\\n\\'Of course,\\' the Dodo replied very gravely.\\n\\'What else have you got in your pocket?\\' he went on, turning to Alice.\\n\\'Only a thimble,\\' said Alice sadly.\\n\\'Hand it over here,\\' said the Dodo.\\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \\'We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble\\'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\n\\'You promised to tell me your history, you know,\\' said Alice, \\'and why it is you hate--C and D,\\' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\\n\\'Mine is a long and a sad tale!\\' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.\\n\\'It IS a long tail, certainly,\\' said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\\'s tail; \\'but why do you call it sad?\\' And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:--           \\'Fury said to a          mouse, That he         met in the        house,      \"Let us       both go to        law: I will         prosecute          YOU.--Come,            I\\'ll take no            denial; We           must have a         trial: For       really this      morning I\\'ve     nothing     to do.\"\\nSaid the       mouse to the        cur, \"Such         a trial,          dear Sir,             With           no jury         or judge,        would be       wasting       our       breath.\"\\n\"I\\'ll be         judge, I\\'ll          be jury.\"\\nSaid          cunning           old Fury:           \"I\\'ll           try the             whole             cause,               and            condemn            you           to            death.\"\\'\\n \\'You are not attending!\\' said the Mouse to Alice severely.\\n\\'What are you thinking of?\\'\\n\\'I beg your pardon,\\' said Alice very humbly: \\'you had got to the fifth bend, I think?\\'\\n\\'I had NOT!\\' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\\n\\'A knot!\\' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her.\\n\\'Oh, do let me help to undo it!\\'\\n\\'I shall do nothing of the sort,\\' said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.\\n\\'You insult me by talking such nonsense!\\'\\n\\'I didn\\'t mean it!\\' pleaded poor Alice.\\n\\'But you\\'re so easily offended, you know!\\'\\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\\n\\'Please come back and finish your story!\\' Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \\'Yes, please do!\\' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\\n\\'What a pity it wouldn\\'t stay!\\' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \\'Ah, my dear!\\nLet this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!\\' \\'Hold your tongue, Ma!\\' said the young Crab, a little snappishly.\\n\\'You\\'re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\\'\\n\\'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\\' said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular.\\n\\'She\\'d soon fetch it back!\\'\\n\\'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\\' said the Lory.\\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \\'Dinah\\'s our cat.\\nAnd she\\'s such a capital one for catching mice you can\\'t think!\\nAnd oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!\\nWhy, she\\'ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\\'\\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.\\nSome of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \\'I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\\'t suit my throat!\\' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \\'Come away, my dears!\\nIt\\'s high time you were all in bed!\\' On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\\n\\'I wish I hadn\\'t mentioned Dinah!\\' she said to herself in a melancholy tone.\\n\\'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\\'m sure she\\'s the best cat in the world!\\nOh, my dear Dinah!\\nI wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\\' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.\\nIn a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.\\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \\'The Duchess!\\nThe Duchess!\\nOh my dear paws!\\nOh my fur and whiskers!\\nShe\\'ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!\\nWhere CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\\' Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \\'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here?\\nRun home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!\\nQuick, now!\\' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.\\n\\'He took me for his housemaid,\\' she said to herself as she ran.\\n\\'How surprised he\\'ll be when he finds out who I am!\\nBut I\\'d better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.\\' As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \\'W.\\nRABBIT\\' engraved upon it.\\nShe went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\\n\\'How queer it seems,\\' Alice said to herself, \\'to be going messages for a rabbit!\\nI suppose Dinah\\'ll be sending me on messages next!\\' And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \\'\"Miss Alice!\\nCome here directly, and get ready for your walk.\"\\n\"Coming in a minute, nurse!\\nBut I\\'ve got to see that the mouse doesn\\'t get out.\"\\nOnly I don\\'t think,\\' Alice went on, \\'that they\\'d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\\'\\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.\\nThere was no label this time with the words \\'DRINK ME,\\' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.\\n\\'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,\\' she said to herself, \\'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\\'ll just see what this bottle does.\\nI do hope it\\'ll make me grow large again, for really I\\'m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\\'\\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.\\nShe hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \\'That\\'s quite enough--I hope I shan\\'t grow any more--As it is, I can\\'t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn\\'t drunk quite so much!\\'\\nAlas!\\nit was too late to wish that!\\nShe went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \\'Now I can do no more, whatever happens.\\nWhat WILL become of me?\\'\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\n\\'It was much pleasanter at home,\\' thought poor Alice, \\'when one wasn\\'t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits.\\nI almost wish I hadn\\'t gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it\\'s rather curious, you know, this sort of life!\\nI do wonder what CAN have happened to me!\\nWhen I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!\\nThere ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!\\nAnd when I grow up, I\\'ll write one--but I\\'m grown up now,\\' she added in a sorrowful tone; \\'at least there\\'s no room to grow up any more HERE.\\'\\n\\'But then,\\' thought Alice, \\'shall I NEVER get any older than I am now?\\nThat\\'ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn!\\nOh, I shouldn\\'t like THAT!\\'\\n\\'Oh, you foolish Alice!\\' she answered herself.\\n\\'How can you learn lessons in here?\\nWhy, there\\'s hardly room for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!\\'\\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\n\\'Mary Ann!\\nMary Ann!\\' said the voice.\\n\\'Fetch me my gloves this moment!\\' Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.\\nAlice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice\\'s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.\\nAlice heard it say to itself \\'Then I\\'ll go round and get in at the window.\\'\\n\\'THAT you won\\'t\\' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.\\nShe did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\nNext came an angry voice--the Rabbit\\'s--\\'Pat!\\nPat!\\nWhere are you?\\' And then a voice she had never heard before, \\'Sure then I\\'m here!\\nDigging for apples, yer honour!\\'\\n\\'Digging for apples, indeed!\\' said the Rabbit angrily.\\n\\'Here!\\nCome and help me out of THIS!\\' (Sounds of more broken glass.)  \\'Now tell me, Pat, what\\'s that in the window?\\'\\n\\'Sure, it\\'s an arm, yer honour!\\' (He pronounced it \\'arrum.\\')  \\'An arm, you goose!\\nWho ever saw one that size?\\nWhy, it fills the whole window!\\'\\n\\'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it\\'s an arm for all that.\\'\\n\\'Well, it\\'s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\\'\\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \\'Sure, I don\\'t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\\' \\'Do as I tell you, you coward!\\' and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air.\\nThis time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.\\n\\'What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\\' thought Alice.\\n\\'I wonder what they\\'ll do next!\\nAs for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!\\nI\\'m sure I don\\'t want to stay in here any longer!\\'\\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \\'Where\\'s the other ladder?--Why, I hadn\\'t to bring but one; Bill\\'s got the other--Bill!\\nfetch it here, lad!--Here, put \\'em up at this corner--No, tie \\'em together first--they don\\'t reach half high enough yet--Oh!\\nthey\\'ll do well enough; don\\'t be particular--Here, Bill!\\ncatch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it\\'s coming down!\\nHeads below!\\' (a loud crash)--\\'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who\\'s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan\\'t!\\nYOU do it!--That I won\\'t, then!--Bill\\'s to go down--Here, Bill!\\nthe master says you\\'re to go down the chimney!\\'\\n\\'Oh!\\nSo Bill\\'s got to come down the chimney, has he?\\' said Alice to herself.\\n\\'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!\\nI wouldn\\'t be in Bill\\'s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!\\'\\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn\\'t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \\'This is Bill,\\' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \\'There goes Bill!\\' then the Rabbit\\'s voice along--\\'Catch him, you by the hedge!\\' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--\\'Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don\\'t choke him--How was it, old fellow?\\nWhat happened to you?\\nTell us all about it!\\'\\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\\'That\\'s Bill,\\' thought Alice,) \\'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I\\'m better now--but I\\'m a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\\'\\n\\'So you did, old fellow!\\' said the others.\\n\\'We must burn the house down!\\' said the Rabbit\\'s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \\'If you do.\\nI\\'ll set Dinah at you!\\'\\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \\'I wonder what they WILL do next!\\nIf they had any sense, they\\'d take the roof off.\\' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \\'A barrowful will do, to begin with.\\'\\n\\'A barrowful of WHAT?\\' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.\\n\\'I\\'ll put a stop to this,\\' she said to herself, and shouted out, \\'You\\'d better not do that again!\\' which produced another dead silence.\\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head.\\n\\'If I eat one of these cakes,\\' she thought, \\'it\\'s sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can\\'t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\\'\\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly.\\nAs soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\\nThe poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.\\nThey all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.\\n\\'The first thing I\\'ve got to do,\\' said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \\'is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.\\nI think that will be the best plan.\\'\\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.\\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.\\n\\'Poor little thing!\\' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\\'s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\\n\\'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!\\' said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \\'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I\\'d only been the right size to do it!\\nOh dear!\\nI\\'d nearly forgotten that I\\'ve got to grow up again!\\nLet me see--how IS it to be managed?\\nI suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\\'\\nThe great question certainly was, what?\\nAlice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\\nAdvice from a Caterpillar  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\\n\\'Who are YOU?\\' said the Caterpillar.\\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.\\nAlice replied, rather shyly, \\'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\\'\\n\\'What do you mean by that?\\' said the Caterpillar sternly.\\n\\'Explain yourself!\\'\\n\\'I can\\'t explain MYSELF, I\\'m afraid, sir\\' said Alice, \\'because I\\'m not myself, you see.\\'\\n\\'I don\\'t see,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\'I\\'m afraid I can\\'t put it more clearly,\\' Alice replied very politely, \\'for I can\\'t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\\'\\n\\'It isn\\'t,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\'Well, perhaps you haven\\'t found it so yet,\\' said Alice; \\'but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\\'ll feel it a little queer, won\\'t you?\\'\\n\\'Not a bit,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\\' said Alice; \\'all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.\\'\\n\\'You!\\' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.\\n\\'Who are YOU?\\'\\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\\'s making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \\'I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.\\'\\n\\'Why?\\' said the Caterpillar.\\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\\n\\'Come back!\\' the Caterpillar called after her.\\n\\'I\\'ve something important to say!\\'\\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\\n\\'Keep your temper,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\'Is that all?\\' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.\\n\\'No,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.\\nFor some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \\'So you think you\\'re changed, do you?\\'\\n\\'I\\'m afraid I am, sir,\\' said Alice; \\'I can\\'t remember things as I used--and I don\\'t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\\'\\n\\'Can\\'t remember WHAT things?\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\'Well, I\\'ve tried to say \"HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE.\"\\nbut it all came different!\\' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\n\\'Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"\\' said the Caterpillar.\\nAlice folded her hands, and began:--     \\'You are old, Father William,\\' the young man said,     \\'And your hair has become very white;    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--     Do you think, at your age, it is right?\\'\\n   \\'In my youth,\\' Father William replied to his son,     \\'I feared it might injure the brain;    But, now that I\\'m perfectly sure I have none,     Why, I do it again and again.\\'\\n   \\'You are old,\\' said the youth, \\'as I mentioned before,     And have grown most uncommonly fat;    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--     Pray, what is the reason of that?\\'\\n   \\'In my youth,\\' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,     \\'I kept all my limbs very supple    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--     Allow me to sell you a couple?\\'\\n   \\'You are old,\\' said the youth, \\'and your jaws are too weak     For anything tougher than suet;    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--     Pray how did you manage to do it?\\'\\n   \\'In my youth,\\' said his father, \\'I took to the law,     And argued each case with my wife;    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,     Has lasted the rest of my life.\\'\\n   \\'You are old,\\' said the youth, \\'one would hardly suppose     That your eye was as steady as ever;    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--     What made you so awfully clever?\\'\\n   \\'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\\'\\n   Said his father; \\'don\\'t give yourself airs!\\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\\nBe off, or I\\'ll kick you down stairs!\\'\\n \\'That is not said right,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\'Not QUITE right, I\\'m afraid,\\' said Alice, timidly; \\'some of the words have got altered.\\'\\n\\'It is wrong from beginning to end,\\' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.\\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\n\\'What size do you want to be?\\' it asked.\\n\\'Oh, I\\'m not particular as to size,\\' Alice hastily replied; \\'only one doesn\\'t like changing so often, you know.\\'\\n\\'I DON\\'T know,\\' said the Caterpillar.\\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\n\\'Are you content now?\\' said the Caterpillar.\\n\\'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn\\'t mind,\\' said Alice: \\'three inches is such a wretched height to be.\\'\\n\\'It is a very good height indeed!\\' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\n\\'But I\\'m not used to it!\\' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.\\nAnd she thought of herself, \\'I wish the creatures wouldn\\'t be so easily offended!\\'\\n\\'You\\'ll get used to it in time,\\' said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.\\nIn a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.\\nThen it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \\'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\\'\\n\\'One side of WHAT?\\nThe other side of WHAT?\\' thought Alice to herself.\\n\\'Of the mushroom,\\' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.\\nHowever, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\\n\\'And now which is which?\\' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.\\nHer chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\\n*    *    *    *    *    *    *      *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  \\'Come, my head\\'s free at last!\\' said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\n\\'What CAN all that green stuff be?\\' said Alice.\\n\\'And where HAVE my shoulders got to?\\nAnd oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\\'t see you?\\' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.\\nShe had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\\n\\'Serpent!\\' screamed the Pigeon.\\n\\'I\\'m NOT a serpent!\\' said Alice indignantly.\\n\\'Let me alone!\\'\\n\\'Serpent, I say again!\\' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \\'I\\'ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\\'\\n\\'I haven\\'t the least idea what you\\'re talking about,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'I\\'ve tried the roots of trees, and I\\'ve tried banks, and I\\'ve tried hedges,\\' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \\'but those serpents!\\nThere\\'s no pleasing them!\\'\\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\n\\'As if it wasn\\'t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\\' said the Pigeon; \\'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!\\nWhy, I haven\\'t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\\'\\n\\'I\\'m very sorry you\\'ve been annoyed,\\' said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.\\n\\'And just as I\\'d taken the highest tree in the wood,\\' continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \\'and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky!\\nUgh, Serpent!\\'\\n\\'But I\\'m NOT a serpent, I tell you!\\' said Alice.\\n\\'I\\'m a--I\\'m a--\\'\\n\\'Well!\\nWHAT are you?\\' said the Pigeon.\\n\\'I can see you\\'re trying to invent something!\\'\\n\\'I--I\\'m a little girl,\\' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\\n\\'A likely story indeed!\\' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.\\n\\'I\\'ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!\\nNo, no!\\nYou\\'re a serpent; and there\\'s no use denying it.\\nI suppose you\\'ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\\'\\n\\'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,\\' said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \\'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\\'\\n\\'I don\\'t believe it,\\' said the Pigeon; \\'but if they do, why then they\\'re a kind of serpent, that\\'s all I can say.\\'\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \\'You\\'re looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\\'re a little girl or a serpent?\\'\\n\\'It matters a good deal to ME,\\' said Alice hastily; \\'but I\\'m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\\'t want YOURS: I don\\'t like them raw.\\'\\n\\'Well, be off, then!\\' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.\\nAlice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.\\nAfter a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.\\n\\'Come, there\\'s half my plan done now!\\nHow puzzling all these changes are!\\nI\\'m never sure what I\\'m going to be, from one minute to another!\\nHowever, I\\'ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, I wonder?\\' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\\n\\'Whoever lives there,\\' thought Alice, \\'it\\'ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\\' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\\nPig and Pepper  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.\\nIt was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.\\nShe felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \\'For the Duchess.\\nAn invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\\' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \\'From the Queen.\\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\\'\\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\n\\'There\\'s no sort of use in knocking,\\' said the Footman, \\'and that for two reasons.\\nFirst, because I\\'m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they\\'re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\\' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\\n\\'Please, then,\\' said Alice, \\'how am I to get in?\\'\\n\\'There might be some sense in your knocking,\\' the Footman went on without attending to her, \\'if we had the door between us.\\nFor instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.\\' He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.\\n\\'But perhaps he can\\'t help it,\\' she said to herself; \\'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\\nBut at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?\\' she repeated, aloud.\\n\\'I shall sit here,\\' the Footman remarked, \\'till tomorrow--\\'\\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman\\'s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\n\\'--or next day, maybe,\\' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.\\n\\'How am I to get in?\\' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\n\\'ARE you to get in at all?\\' said the Footman.\\n\\'That\\'s the first question, you know.\\'\\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.\\n\\'It\\'s really dreadful,\\' she muttered to herself, \\'the way all the creatures argue.\\nIt\\'s enough to drive one crazy!\\'\\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations.\\n\\'I shall sit here,\\' he said, \\'on and off, for days and days.\\'\\n\\'But what am I to do?\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Anything you like,\\' said the Footman, and began whistling.\\n\\'Oh, there\\'s no use in talking to him,\\' said Alice desperately: \\'he\\'s perfectly idiotic!\\' And she opened the door and went in.\\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\\n\\'There\\'s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\\' Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.\\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air.\\nEven the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment\\'s pause.\\nThe only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\'Please would you tell me,\\' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \\'why your cat grins like that?\\'\\n\\'It\\'s a Cheshire cat,\\' said the Duchess, \\'and that\\'s why.\\nPig!\\'\\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--  \\'I didn\\'t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\\'t know that cats COULD grin.\\'\\n\\'They all can,\\' said the Duchess; \\'and most of \\'em do.\\'\\n\\'I don\\'t know of any that do,\\' Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.\\n\\'You don\\'t know much,\\' said the Duchess; \\'and that\\'s a fact.\\'\\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.\\nWhile she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.\\nThe Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\n\\'Oh, PLEASE mind what you\\'re doing!\\' cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror.\\n\\'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose\\'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\\n\\'If everybody minded their own business,\\' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, \\'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\\'\\n\\'Which would NOT be an advantage,\\' said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.\\n\\'Just think of what work it would make with the day and night!\\nYou see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--\\'\\n\\'Talking of axes,\\' said the Duchess, \\'chop off her head!\\'\\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: \\'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?\\nI--\\'\\n\\'Oh, don\\'t bother ME,\\' said the Duchess; \\'I never could abide figures!\\' And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:     \\'Speak roughly to your little boy,     And beat him when he sneezes:    He only does it to annoy,     Because he knows it teases.\\'\\n         CHORUS.\\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):--         \\'Wow!\\nwow!\\nwow!\\'\\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--     \\'I speak severely to my boy,     I beat him when he sneezes;    For he can thoroughly enjoy     The pepper when he pleases!\\'\\n         CHORUS.\\n\\'Wow!\\nwow!\\nwow!\\'\\n\\'Here!\\nyou may nurse it a bit, if you like!\\' the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.\\n\\'I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\\' and she hurried out of the room.\\nThe cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, \\'just like a star-fish,\\' thought Alice.\\nThe poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.\\n\\'IF I don\\'t take this child away with me,\\' thought Alice, \\'they\\'re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\\'t it be murder to leave it behind?\\' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\\n\\'Don\\'t grunt,\\' said Alice; \\'that\\'s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.\\'\\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.\\nThere could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.\\n\\'But perhaps it was only sobbing,\\' she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\\nNo, there were no tears.\\n\\'If you\\'re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\\' said Alice, seriously, \\'I\\'ll have nothing more to do with you.\\nMind now!\\' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \\'Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?\\' when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.\\nThis time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.\\n\\'If it had grown up,\\' she said to herself, \\'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.\\' And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \\'if one only knew the right way to change them--\\' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.\\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.\\nIt looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\\n\\'Cheshire Puss,\\' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.\\n\\'Come, it\\'s pleased so far,\\' thought Alice, and she went on.\\n\\'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\\'\\n\\'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\\' said the Cat.\\n\\'I don\\'t much care where--\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Then it doesn\\'t matter which way you go,\\' said the Cat.\\n\\'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\\' Alice added as an explanation.\\n\\'Oh, you\\'re sure to do that,\\' said the Cat, \\'if you only walk long enough.\\'\\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.\\n\\'What sort of people live about here?\\'\\n\\'In THAT direction,\\' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \\'lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,\\' waving the other paw, \\'lives a March Hare.\\nVisit either you like: they\\'re both mad.\\'\\n\\'But I don\\'t want to go among mad people,\\' Alice remarked.\\n\\'Oh, you can\\'t help that,\\' said the Cat: \\'we\\'re all mad here.\\nI\\'m mad.\\nYou\\'re mad.\\'\\n\\'How do you know I\\'m mad?\\' said Alice.\\n\\'You must be,\\' said the Cat, \\'or you wouldn\\'t have come here.\\'\\nAlice didn\\'t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \\'And how do you know that you\\'re mad?\\'\\n\\'To begin with,\\' said the Cat, \\'a dog\\'s not mad.\\nYou grant that?\\'\\n\\'I suppose so,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Well, then,\\' the Cat went on, \\'you see, a dog growls when it\\'s angry, and wags its tail when it\\'s pleased.\\nNow I growl when I\\'m pleased, and wag my tail when I\\'m angry.\\nTherefore I\\'m mad.\\'\\n\\'I call it purring, not growling,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Call it what you like,\\' said the Cat.\\n\\'Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\\'\\n\\'I should like it very much,\\' said Alice, \\'but I haven\\'t been invited yet.\\'\\n\\'You\\'ll see me there,\\' said the Cat, and vanished.\\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.\\nWhile she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.\\n\\'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\\' said the Cat.\\n\\'I\\'d nearly forgotten to ask.\\'\\n\\'It turned into a pig,\\' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.\\n\\'I thought it would,\\' said the Cat, and vanished again.\\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.\\n\\'I\\'ve seen hatters before,\\' she said to herself; \\'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won\\'t be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.\\' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\\n\\'Did you say pig, or fig?\\' said the Cat.\\n\\'I said pig,\\' replied Alice; \\'and I wish you wouldn\\'t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\\'\\n\\'All right,\\' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\\n\\'Well!\\nI\\'ve often seen a cat without a grin,\\' thought Alice; \\'but a grin without a cat!\\nIt\\'s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\\'\\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.\\nIt was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself \\'Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\\nA Mad Tea-Party  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.\\n\\'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\\' thought Alice; \\'only, as it\\'s asleep, I suppose it doesn\\'t mind.\\'\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \\'No room!\\nNo room!\\' they cried out when they saw Alice coming.\\n\\'There\\'s PLENTY of room!\\' said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\\'Have some wine,\\' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\n\\'I don\\'t see any wine,\\' she remarked.\\n\\'There isn\\'t any,\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\'Then it wasn\\'t very civil of you to offer it,\\' said Alice angrily.\\n\\'It wasn\\'t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\'I didn\\'t know it was YOUR table,\\' said Alice; \\'it\\'s laid for a great many more than three.\\'\\n\\'Your hair wants cutting,\\' said the Hatter.\\nHe had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\\n\\'You should learn not to make personal remarks,\\' Alice said with some severity; \\'it\\'s very rude.\\'\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID was, \\'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\\'\\n\\'Come, we shall have some fun now!\\' thought Alice.\\n\\'I\\'m glad they\\'ve begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,\\' she added aloud.\\n\\'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\'Exactly so,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Then you should say what you mean,\\' the March Hare went on.\\n\\'I do,\\' Alice hastily replied; \\'at least--at least I mean what I say--that\\'s the same thing, you know.\\'\\n\\'Not the same thing a bit!\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\'You might just as well say that \"I see what I ea.\"\\nis the same thing as \"I eat what I see\"!\\'\\n\\'You might just as well say,\\' added the March Hare, \\'that \"I like what I ge.\"\\nis the same thing as \"I get what I like\"!\\'\\n\\'You might just as well say,\\' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, \\'that \"I breathe when I slee.\"\\nis the same thing as \"I sleep when I breathe\"!\\'\\n\\'It IS the same thing with you,\\' said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn\\'t much.\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence.\\n\\'What day of the month is it?\\' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.\\nAlice considered a little, and then said \\'The fourth.\\'\\n\\'Two days wrong!\\' sighed the Hatter.\\n\\'I told you butter wouldn\\'t suit the works!\\' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\n\\'It was the BEST butter,\\' the March Hare meekly replied.\\n\\'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\\' the Hatter grumbled: \\'you shouldn\\'t have put it in with the bread-knife.\\'\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \\'It was the BEST butter, you know.\\'\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.\\n\\'What a funny watch!\\' she remarked.\\n\\'It tells the day of the month, and doesn\\'t tell what o\\'clock it is!\\'\\n\\'Why should it?\\' muttered the Hatter.\\n\\'Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?\\'\\n\\'Of course not,\\' Alice replied very readily: \\'but that\\'s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.\\'\\n\\'Which is just the case with MINE,\\' said the Hatter.\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled.\\nThe Hatter\\'s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.\\n\\'I don\\'t quite understand you,\\' she said, as politely as she could.\\n\\'The Dormouse is asleep again,\\' said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, \\'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\\'\\n\\'Have you guessed the riddle yet?\\' the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.\\n\\'No, I give it up,\\' Alice replied: \\'what\\'s the answer?\\'\\n\\'I haven\\'t the slightest idea,\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\'Nor I,\\' said the March Hare.\\nAlice sighed wearily.\\n\\'I think you might do something better with the time,\\' she said, \\'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\\'\\n\\'If you knew Time as well as I do,\\' said the Hatter, \\'you wouldn\\'t talk about wasting IT.\\nIt\\'s HIM.\\'\\n\\'I don\\'t know what you mean,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Of course you don\\'t!\\' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.\\n\\'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\\'\\n\\'Perhaps not,\\' Alice cautiously replied: \\'but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\\'\\n\\'Ah!\\nthat accounts for it,\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\'He won\\'t stand beating.\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\\'d do almost anything you liked with the clock.\\nFor instance, suppose it were nine o\\'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\\'d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling!\\nHalf-past one, time for dinner!\\'\\n(\\'I only wish it was,\\' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)  \\'That would be grand, certainly,\\' said Alice thoughtfully: \\'but then--I shouldn\\'t be hungry for it, you know.\\'\\n\\'Not at first, perhaps,\\' said the Hatter: \\'but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.\\'\\n\\'Is that the way YOU manage?\\' Alice asked.\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully.\\n\\'Not I!\\' he replied.\\n\\'We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--\\' (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \\'--it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing       \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\nHow I wonder what you\\'re at.\"\\nYou know the song, perhaps?\\'\\n\\'I\\'ve heard something like it,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'It goes on, you know,\\' the Hatter continued, \\'in this way:--       \"Up above the world you fly,      Like a tea-tray in the sky.\\nTwinkle, twinkle--\"\\'\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \\'Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--\\' and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.\\n\\'Well, I\\'d hardly finished the first verse,\\' said the Hatter, \\'when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He\\'s murdering the time!\\nOff with his head!\"\\'\\n\\'How dreadfully savage!\\' exclaimed Alice.\\n\\'And ever since that,\\' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \\'he won\\'t do a thing I ask!\\nIt\\'s always six o\\'clock now.\\'\\nA bright idea came into Alice\\'s head.\\n\\'Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?\\' she asked.\\n\\'Yes, that\\'s it,\\' said the Hatter with a sigh: \\'it\\'s always tea-time, and we\\'ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\\'\\n\\'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Exactly so,\\' said the Hatter: \\'as the things get used up.\\'\\n\\'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\\' Alice ventured to ask.\\n\\'Suppose we change the subject,\\' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\n\\'I\\'m getting tired of this.\\nI vote the young lady tells us a story.\\'\\n\\'I\\'m afraid I don\\'t know one,\\' said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.\\n\\'Then the Dormouse shall!\\' they both cried.\\n\\'Wake up, Dormouse!\\' And they pinched it on both sides at once.\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.\\n\\'I wasn\\'t asleep,\\' he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: \\'I heard every word you fellows were saying.\\'\\n\\'Tell us a story!\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\'Yes, please do!\\' pleaded Alice.\\n\\'And be quick about it,\\' added the Hatter, \\'or you\\'ll be asleep again before it\\'s done.\\'\\n\\'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\\' the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \\'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--\\'\\n\\'What did they live on?\\' said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.\\n\\'They lived on treacle,\\' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.\\n\\'They couldn\\'t have done that, you know,\\' Alice gently remarked; \\'they\\'d have been ill.\\'\\n\\'So they were,\\' said the Dormouse; \\'VERY ill.\\'\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \\'But why did they live at the bottom of a well?\\'\\n\\'Take some more tea,\\' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\\'I\\'ve had nothing yet,\\' Alice replied in an offended tone, \\'so I can\\'t take more.\\'\\n\\'You mean you can\\'t take LESS,\\' said the Hatter: \\'it\\'s very easy to take MORE than nothing.\\'\\n\\'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Who\\'s making personal remarks now?\\' the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.\\n\\'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\\'\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \\'It was a treacle-well.\\'\\n\\'There\\'s no such thing!\\' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \\'Sh!\\nsh!\\' and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \\'If you can\\'t be civil, you\\'d better finish the story for yourself.\\'\\n\\'No, please go on!\\' Alice said very humbly; \\'I won\\'t interrupt again.\\nI dare say there may be ONE.\\'\\n\\'One, indeed!\\' said the Dormouse indignantly.\\nHowever, he consented to go on.\\n\\'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--\\'\\n\\'What did they draw?\\' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\n\\'Treacle,\\' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\n\\'I want a clean cup,\\' interrupted the Hatter: \\'let\\'s all move one place on.\\'\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse\\'s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.\\nThe Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: \\'But I don\\'t understand.\\nWhere did they draw the treacle from?\\'\\n\\'You can draw water out of a water-well,\\' said the Hatter; \\'so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?\\'\\n\\'But they were IN the well,\\' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.\\n\\'Of course they were\\', said the Dormouse; \\'--well in.\\'\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.\\n\\'They were learning to draw,\\' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \\'and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--\\'\\n\\'Why with an M?\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Why not?\\' said the March Hare.\\nAlice was silent.\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: \\'--that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?\\'\\n\\'Really, now you ask me,\\' said Alice, very much confused, \\'I don\\'t think--\\'\\n\\'Then you shouldn\\'t talk,\\' said the Hatter.\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.\\n\\'At any rate I\\'ll never go THERE again!\\' said Alice as she picked her way through the wood.\\n\\'It\\'s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!\\'\\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it.\\n\\'That\\'s very curious!\\' she thought.\\n\\'But everything\\'s curious today.\\nI think I may as well go in at once.\\' And in she went.\\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table.\\n\\'Now, I\\'ll manage better this time,\\' she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.\\nThen she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.\\nThe Queen\\'s Croquet-Ground  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.\\nAlice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, \\'Look out now, Five!\\nDon\\'t go splashing paint over me like that!\\'\\n\\'I couldn\\'t help it,\\' said Five, in a sulky tone; \\'Seven jogged my elbow.\\'\\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \\'That\\'s right, Five!\\nAlways lay the blame on others!\\'\\n\\'YOU\\'D better not talk!\\' said Five.\\n\\'I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\\'\\n\\'What for?\\' said the one who had spoken first.\\n\\'That\\'s none of YOUR business, Two!\\' said Seven.\\n\\'Yes, it IS his business!\\' said Five, \\'and I\\'ll tell him--it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\\'\\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \\'Well, of all the unjust things--\\' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.\\n\\'Would you tell me,\\' said Alice, a little timidly, \\'why you are painting those roses?\\'\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.\\nTwo began in a low voice, \\'Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.\\nSo you see, Miss, we\\'re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\\' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \\'The Queen!\\nThe Queen!\\' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces.\\nThere was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.\\nAfter these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.\\nNext came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her.\\nThen followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\\'s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \\'and besides, what would be the use of a procession,\\' thought she, \\'if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\\'t see it?\\' So she stood still where she was, and waited.\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely \\'Who is this?\\' She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\n\\'Idiot!\\' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, \\'What\\'s your name, child?\\'\\n\\'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\\' said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, \\'Why, they\\'re only a pack of cards, after all.\\nI needn\\'t be afraid of them!\\'\\n\\'And who are THESE?\\' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.\\n\\'How should I know?\\' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.\\n\\'It\\'s no business of MINE.\\'\\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed \\'Off with her head!\\nOff--\\'\\n\\'Nonsense!\\' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.\\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \\'Consider, my dear: she is only a child!\\'\\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \\'Turn them over!\\'\\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\n\\'Get up!\\' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\\n\\'Leave off that!\\' screamed the Queen.\\n\\'You make me giddy.\\' And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, \\'What HAVE you been doing here?\\'\\n\\'May it please your Majesty,\\' said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \\'we were trying--\\'\\n\\'I see!\\' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\n\\'Off with their heads!\\' and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\\n\\'You shan\\'t be beheaded!\\' said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near.\\nThe three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.\\n\\'Are their heads off?\\' shouted the Queen.\\n\\'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\\' the soldiers shouted in reply.\\n\\'That\\'s right!\\' shouted the Queen.\\n\\'Can you play croquet?\\'\\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.\\n\\'Yes!\\' shouted Alice.\\n\\'Come on, then!\\' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.\\n\\'It\\'s--it\\'s a very fine day!\\' said a timid voice at her side.\\nShe was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\n\\'Very,\\' said Alice: \\'--where\\'s the Duchess?\\'\\n\\'Hush!\\nHush!\\' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.\\nHe looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \\'She\\'s under sentence of execution.\\'\\n\\'What for?\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Did you say \"What a pity!\"?\\' the Rabbit asked.\\n\\'No, I didn\\'t,\\' said Alice: \\'I don\\'t think it\\'s at all a pity.\\nI said \"What for?\"\\'\\n\\'She boxed the Queen\\'s ears--\\' the Rabbit began.\\nAlice gave a little scream of laughter.\\n\\'Oh, hush!\\' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.\\n\\'The Queen will hear you!\\nYou see, she came rather late, and the Queen said--\\'\\n\\'Get to your places!\\' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.\\nAlice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting \\'Off with his head!\\' or \\'Off with her head!\\' about once in a minute.\\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, \\'and then,\\' thought she, \\'what would become of me?\\nThey\\'re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\\'s any one left alive!\\'\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself \\'It\\'s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\\'\\n\\'How are you getting on?\\' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.\\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.\\n\\'It\\'s no use speaking to it,\\' she thought, \\'till its ears have come, or at least one of them.\\' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.\\nThe Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\n\\'I don\\'t think they play at all fairly,\\' Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \\'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\\'t hear oneself speak--and they don\\'t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you\\'ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\\'s the arch I\\'ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen\\'s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\\'\\n\\'How do you like the Queen?\\' said the Cat in a low voice.\\n\\'Not at all,\\' said Alice: \\'she\\'s so extremely--\\' Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \\'--likely to win, that it\\'s hardly worth while finishing the game.\\'\\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\n\\'Who ARE you talking to?\\' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\\'s head with great curiosity.\\n\\'It\\'s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\\' said Alice: \\'allow me to introduce it.\\'\\n\\'I don\\'t like the look of it at all,\\' said the King: \\'however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\\'\\n\\'I\\'d rather not,\\' the Cat remarked.\\n\\'Don\\'t be impertinent,\\' said the King, \\'and don\\'t look at me like that!\\' He got behind Alice as he spoke.\\n\\'A cat may look at a king,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'I\\'ve read that in some book, but I don\\'t remember where.\\'\\n\\'Well, it must be removed,\\' said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \\'My dear!\\nI wish you would have this cat removed!\\'\\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.\\n\\'Off with his head!\\' she said, without even looking round.\\n\\'I\\'ll fetch the executioner myself,\\' said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.\\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen\\'s voice in the distance, screaming with passion.\\nShe had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not.\\nSo she went in search of her hedgehog.\\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \\'but it doesn\\'t matter much,\\' thought Alice, \\'as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.\\' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.\\nThe executioner\\'s argument was, that you couldn\\'t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn\\'t going to begin at HIS time of life.\\nThe King\\'s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren\\'t to talk nonsense.\\nThe Queen\\'s argument was, that if something wasn\\'t done about it in less than no time she\\'d have everybody executed, all round.\\n(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)  Alice could think of nothing else to say but \\'It belongs to the Duchess: you\\'d better ask HER about it.\\'\\n\\'She\\'s in prison,\\' the Queen said to the executioner: \\'fetch her here.\\' And the executioner went off like an arrow.\\nThe Cat\\'s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.\\nThe Mock Turtle\\'s Story  \\'You can\\'t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\\' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\\'s, and they walked off together.\\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.\\n\\'When I\\'M a Duchess,\\' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), \\'I won\\'t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL.\\nSoup does very well without--Maybe it\\'s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,\\' she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, \\'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.\\nI only wish people knew that: then they wouldn\\'t be so stingy about it, you know--\\'\\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.\\n\\'You\\'re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\\nI can\\'t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.\\'\\n\\'Perhaps it hasn\\'t one,\\' Alice ventured to remark.\\n\\'Tut, tut, child!\\' said the Duchess.\\n\\'Everything\\'s got a moral, if only you can find it.\\' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\\'s side as she spoke.\\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice\\'s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.\\nHowever, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\\n\\'The game\\'s going on rather better now,\\' she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.\\n\\'\\'Tis so,\\' said the Duchess: \\'and the moral of that is--\"Oh, \\'tis love, \\'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"\\'\\n\\'Somebody said,\\' Alice whispered, \\'that it\\'s done by everybody minding their own business!\\'\\n\\'Ah, well!\\nIt means much the same thing,\\' said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice\\'s shoulder as she added, \\'and the moral of THAT is--\"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.\"\\'\\n\\'How fond she is of finding morals in things!\\' Alice thought to herself.\\n\\'I dare say you\\'re wondering why I don\\'t put my arm round your waist,\\' the Duchess said after a pause: \\'the reason is, that I\\'m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.\\nShall I try the experiment?\\'\\n\\'HE might bite,\\' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.\\n\\'Very true,\\' said the Duchess: \\'flamingoes and mustard both bite.\\nAnd the moral of that is--\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"\\'\\n\\'Only mustard isn\\'t a bird,\\' Alice remarked.\\n\\'Right, as usual,\\' said the Duchess: \\'what a clear way you have of putting things!\\'\\n\\'It\\'s a mineral, I THINK,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Of course it is,\\' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; \\'there\\'s a large mustard-mine near here.\\nAnd the moral of that is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.\"\\'\\n\\'Oh, I know!\\' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, \\'it\\'s a vegetable.\\nIt doesn\\'t look like one, but it is.\\'\\n\\'I quite agree with you,\\' said the Duchess; \\'and the moral of that is--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you\\'d like it put more simply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\"\\'\\n\\'I think I should understand that better,\\' Alice said very politely, \\'if I had it written down: but I can\\'t quite follow it as you say it.\\'\\n\\'That\\'s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\\' the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.\\n\\'Pray don\\'t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Oh, don\\'t talk about trouble!\\' said the Duchess.\\n\\'I make you a present of everything I\\'ve said as yet.\\'\\n\\'A cheap sort of present!\\' thought Alice.\\n\\'I\\'m glad they don\\'t give birthday presents like that!\\' But she did not venture to say it out loud.\\n\\'Thinking again?\\' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.\\n\\'I\\'ve a right to think,\\' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.\\n\\'Just about as much right,\\' said the Duchess, \\'as pigs have to fly; and the m--\\'\\nBut here, to Alice\\'s great surprise, the Duchess\\'s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word \\'moral,\\' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.\\nAlice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\\n\\'A fine day, your Majesty!\\' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\\n\\'Now, I give you fair warning,\\' shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; \\'either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time!\\nTake your choice!\\'\\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\\n\\'Let\\'s go on with the game,\\' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.\\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\\'s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\\'s delay would cost them their lives.\\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting \\'Off with his head!\\' or \\'Off with her head!\\' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.\\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \\'Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\\'\\n\\'No,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'I don\\'t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\\'\\n\\'It\\'s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\\' said the Queen.\\n\\'I never saw one, or heard of one,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Come on, then,\\' said the Queen, \\'and he shall tell you his history,\\'\\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \\'You are all pardoned.\\' \\'Come, THAT\\'S a good thing!\\' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.\\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.\\n(IF you don\\'t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \\'Up, lazy thing!\\' said the Queen, \\'and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.\\nI must go back and see after some executions I have ordered\\'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.\\nAlice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled.\\n\\'What fun!\\' said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\\n\\'What IS the fun?\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Why, SHE,\\' said the Gryphon.\\n\\'It\\'s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know.\\nCome on!\\'\\n\\'Everybody says \"come on.\"\\nhere,\\' thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: \\'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\\'\\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.\\nShe pitied him deeply.\\n\\'What is his sorrow?\\' she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \\'It\\'s all his fancy, that: he hasn\\'t got no sorrow, you know.\\nCome on!\\'\\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\\n\\'This here young lady,\\' said the Gryphon, \\'she wants for to know your history, she do.\\'\\n\\'I\\'ll tell it her,\\' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \\'sit down, both of you, and don\\'t speak a word till I\\'ve finished.\\'\\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.\\nAlice thought to herself, \\'I don\\'t see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn\\'t begin.\\' But she waited patiently.\\n\\'Once,\\' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \\'I was a real Turtle.\\'\\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of \\'Hjckrrh!\\' from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.\\nAlice was very nearly getting up and saying, \\'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,\\' but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\\n\\'When we were little,\\' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, \\'we went to school in the sea.\\nThe master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--\\'\\n\\'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\\'t one?\\' Alice asked.\\n\\'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,\\' said the Mock Turtle angrily: \\'really you are very dull!\\'\\n\\'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\\' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.\\nAt last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \\'Drive on, old fellow!\\nDon\\'t be all day about it!\\' and he went on in these words:  \\'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\\'t believe it--\\'\\n\\'I never said I didn\\'t!\\' interrupted Alice.\\n\\'You did,\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\'Hold your tongue!\\' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\\n\\'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--\\'\\n\\'I\\'VE been to a day-school, too,\\' said Alice; \\'you needn\\'t be so proud as all that.\\'\\n\\'With extras?\\' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Alice, \\'we learned French and music.\\'\\n\\'And washing?\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\'Certainly not!\\' said Alice indignantly.\\n\\'Ah!\\nthen yours wasn\\'t a really good school,\\' said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief.\\n\\'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill, \"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"\\'\\n\\'You couldn\\'t have wanted it much,\\' said Alice; \\'living at the bottom of the sea.\\'\\n\\'I couldn\\'t afford to learn it.\\' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.\\n\\'I only took the regular course.\\'\\n\\'What was that?\\' inquired Alice.\\n\\'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\\' the Mock Turtle replied; \\'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.\\'\\n\\'I never heard of \"Uglification,\"\\' Alice ventured to say.\\n\\'What is it?\\'\\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.\\n\\'What!\\nNever heard of uglifying!\\' it exclaimed.\\n\\'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?\\'\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Alice doubtfully: \\'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.\\'\\n\\'Well, then,\\' the Gryphon went on, \\'if you don\\'t know what to uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.\\'\\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \\'What else had you to learn?\\'\\n\\'Well, there was Mystery,\\' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, \\'--Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\\'\\n\\'What was THAT like?\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Well, I can\\'t show it you myself,\\' the Mock Turtle said: \\'I\\'m too stiff.\\nAnd the Gryphon never learnt it.\\'\\n\\'Hadn\\'t time,\\' said the Gryphon: \\'I went to the Classics master, though.\\nHe was an old crab, HE was.\\'\\n\\'I never went to him,\\' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \\'he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.\\'\\n\\'So he did, so he did,\\' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.\\n\\'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?\\' said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.\\n\\'Ten hours the first day,\\' said the Mock Turtle: \\'nine the next, and so on.\\'\\n\\'What a curious plan!\\' exclaimed Alice.\\n\\'That\\'s the reason they\\'re called lessons,\\' the Gryphon remarked: \\'because they lessen from day to day.\\'\\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark.\\n\\'Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?\\'\\n\\'Of course it was,\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\'And how did you manage on the twelfth?\\' Alice went on eagerly.\\nThe Lobster Quadrille  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes.\\nHe looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice.\\n\\'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\\' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back.\\nAt last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:--  \\'You may not have lived much under the sea--\\' (\\'I haven\\'t,\\' said Alice)--\\'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--\\' (Alice began to say \\'I once tasted--\\' but checked herself hastily, and said \\'No, never\\') \\'--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!\\'\\n\\'No, indeed,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'What sort of a dance is it?\\'\\n\\'Why,\\' said the Gryphon, \\'you first form into a line along the sea-shore--\\'\\n\\'Two lines!\\' cried the Mock Turtle.\\n\\'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you\\'ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--\\'\\n\\'THAT generally takes some time,\\' interrupted the Gryphon.\\n\\'--you advance twice--\\'\\n\\'Each with a lobster as a partner!\\' cried the Gryphon.\\n\\'Of course,\\' the Mock Turtle said: \\'advance twice, set to partners--\\'\\n\\'--change lobsters, and retire in same order,\\' continued the Gryphon.\\n\\'Then, you know,\\' the Mock Turtle went on, \\'you throw the--\\'\\n\\'The lobsters!\\' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\n\\'--as far out to sea as you can--\\'\\n\\'Swim after them!\\' screamed the Gryphon.\\n\\'Turn a somersault in the sea!\\' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.\\n\\'Change lobsters again!\\' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\n\\'Back to land again, and that\\'s all the first figure,\\' said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\\n\\'It must be a very pretty dance,\\' said Alice timidly.\\n\\'Would you like to see a little of it?\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\'Very much indeed,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Come, let\\'s try the first figure!\\' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.\\n\\'We can do without lobsters, you know.\\nWhich shall sing?\\'\\n\\'Oh, YOU sing,\\' said the Gryphon.\\n\\'I\\'ve forgotten the words.\\'\\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:--   \\'\"Will you walk a little faster?\"\\nsaid a whiting to a snail.\\n\"There\\'s a porpoise close behind us, and he\\'s treading on my tail.\\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\nThey are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?\\nWill you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, won\\'t you join the dance?\\n\"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea.\"\\nBut the snail replied \"Too far, too far.\"\\nand gave a look askance--  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\n\\'\"What matters it how far we go?\"\\nhis scaly friend replied.\\n\"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France--  Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\nWill you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, will you join the dance?\\nWill you, won\\'t you, will you, won\\'t you, won\\'t you join the dance?\"\\'\\n\\'Thank you, it\\'s a very interesting dance to watch,\\' said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: \\'and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!\\'\\n\\'Oh, as to the whiting,\\' said the Mock Turtle, \\'they--you\\'ve seen them, of course?\\'\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Alice, \\'I\\'ve often seen them at dinn--\\' she checked herself hastily.\\n\\'I don\\'t know where Dinn may be,\\' said the Mock Turtle, \\'but if you\\'ve seen them so often, of course you know what they\\'re like.\\'\\n\\'I believe so,\\' Alice replied thoughtfully.\\n\\'They have their tails in their mouths--and they\\'re all over crumbs.\\'\\n\\'You\\'re wrong about the crumbs,\\' said the Mock Turtle: \\'crumbs would all wash off in the sea.\\nBut they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--\\' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--\\'Tell her about the reason and all that,\\' he said to the Gryphon.\\n\\'The reason is,\\' said the Gryphon, \\'that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance.\\nSo they got thrown out to sea.\\nSo they had to fall a long way.\\nSo they got their tails fast in their mouths.\\nSo they couldn\\'t get them out again.\\nThat\\'s all.\\'\\n\\'Thank you,\\' said Alice, \\'it\\'s very interesting.\\nI never knew so much about a whiting before.\\'\\n\\'I can tell you more than that, if you like,\\' said the Gryphon.\\n\\'Do you know why it\\'s called a whiting?\\'\\n\\'I never thought about it,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Why?\\'\\n\\'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.\\' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled.\\n\\'Does the boots and shoes!\\' she repeated in a wondering tone.\\n\\'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?\\' said the Gryphon.\\n\\'I mean, what makes them so shiny?\\'\\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.\\n\\'They\\'re done with blacking, I believe.\\'\\n\\'Boots and shoes under the sea,\\' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, \\'are done with a whiting.\\nNow you know.\\'\\n\\'And what are they made of?\\' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\n\\'Soles and eels, of course,\\' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \\'any shrimp could have told you that.\\'\\n\\'If I\\'d been the whiting,\\' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \\'I\\'d have said to the porpoise, \"Keep back, please: we don\\'t want YOU with us!\"\\'\\n\\'They were obliged to have him with them,\\' the Mock Turtle said: \\'no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\\'\\n\\'Wouldn\\'t it really?\\' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\n\\'Of course not,\\' said the Mock Turtle: \\'why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \"With what porpoise?\"\\'\\n\\'Don\\'t you mean \"purpose\"?\\' said Alice.\\n\\'I mean what I say,\\' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.\\nAnd the Gryphon added \\'Come, let\\'s hear some of YOUR adventures.\\'\\n\\'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\\' said Alice a little timidly: \\'but it\\'s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\\'\\n\\'Explain all that,\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\'No, no!\\nThe adventures first,\\' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \\'explanations take such a dreadful time.\\'\\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit.\\nShe was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on.\\nHer listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating \\'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\\' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said \\'That\\'s very curious.\\'\\n\\'It\\'s all about as curious as it can be,\\' said the Gryphon.\\n\\'It all came different!\\' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.\\n\\'I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.\\nTell her to begin.\\' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.\\n\\'Stand up and repeat \"\\'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\"\\' said the Gryphon.\\n\\'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\\' thought Alice; \\'I might as well be at school at once.\\' However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--    \\'\\'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,   \"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose   Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\\'\\n       [later editions continued as follows   When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,   And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,   But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,   His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]  \\'That\\'s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\\' said the Gryphon.\\n\\'Well, I never heard it before,\\' said the Mock Turtle; \\'but it sounds uncommon nonsense.\\'\\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.\\n\\'I should like to have it explained,\\' said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\'She can\\'t explain it,\\' said the Gryphon hastily.\\n\\'Go on with the next verse.\\'\\n\\'But about his toes?\\' the Mock Turtle persisted.\\n\\'How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?\\'\\n\\'It\\'s the first position in dancing.\\' Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\n\\'Go on with the next verse,\\' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \\'it begins \"I passed by his garden.\"\\'\\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--    \\'I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,   How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--\\'\\n    [later editions continued as follows   The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,   While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,   Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:   While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,   And concluded the banquet--]  \\'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,\\' the Mock Turtle interrupted, \\'if you don\\'t explain it as you go on?\\nIt\\'s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!\\'\\n\\'Yes, I think you\\'d better leave off,\\' said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.\\n\\'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\\' the Gryphon went on.\\n\\'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\\'\\n\\'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\\' Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, \\'Hm!\\nNo accounting for tastes!\\nSing her \"Turtle Soup.\"\\nwill you, old fellow?\\'\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:--     \\'Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,    Waiting in a hot tureen!\\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\nBeau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\nBeau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\nSoo--oop of the e--e--evening,      Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\n\\'Beautiful Soup!\\nWho cares for fish,    Game, or any other dish?\\nWho would not give all else for two    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\nBeau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\nBeau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\nSoo--oop of the e--e--evening,      Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!\\'\\n\\'Chorus again!\\' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of \\'The trial\\'s beginning!\\' was heard in the distance.\\n\\'Come on!\\' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.\\nWho Stole the Tarts?\\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.\\nIn the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--\\'I wish they\\'d get the trial done,\\' she thought, \\'and hand round the refreshments!\\' But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.\\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there.\\n\\'That\\'s the judge,\\' she said to herself, \\'because of his great wig.\\'\\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\n\\'And that\\'s the jury-box,\\' thought Alice, \\'and those twelve creatures,\\' (she was obliged to say \\'creatures,\\' you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) \\'I suppose they are the jurors.\\' She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.\\nHowever, \\'jury-men\\' would have done just as well.\\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.\\n\\'What are they doing?\\' Alice whispered to the Gryphon.\\n\\'They can\\'t have anything to put down yet, before the trial\\'s begun.\\'\\n\\'They\\'re putting down their names,\\' the Gryphon whispered in reply, \\'for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\\'\\n\\'Stupid things!\\' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \\'Silence in the court!\\' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.\\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down \\'stupid things!\\' on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn\\'t know how to spell \\'stupid,\\' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.\\n\\'A nice muddle their slates\\'ll be in before the trial\\'s over!\\' thought Alice.\\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.\\nThis of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.\\nShe did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\\n\\'Herald, read the accusation!\\' said the King.\\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--     \\'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,       All on a summer day:     The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,       And took them quite away!\\'\\n\\'Consider your verdict,\\' the King said to the jury.\\n\\'Not yet, not yet!\\' the Rabbit hastily interrupted.\\n\\'There\\'s a great deal to come before that!\\'\\n\\'Call the first witness,\\' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \\'First witness!\\'\\nThe first witness was the Hatter.\\nHe came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.\\n\\'I beg pardon, your Majesty,\\' he began, \\'for bringing these in: but I hadn\\'t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.\\'\\n\\'You ought to have finished,\\' said the King.\\n\\'When did you begin?\\'\\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.\\n\\'Fourteenth of March, I think it was,\\' he said.\\n\\'Fifteenth,\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\'Sixteenth,\\' added the Dormouse.\\n\\'Write that down,\\' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\\n\\'Take off your hat,\\' the King said to the Hatter.\\n\\'It isn\\'t mine,\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\'Stolen!\\' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.\\n\\'I keep them to sell,\\' the Hatter added as an explanation; \\'I\\'ve none of my own.\\nI\\'m a hatter.\\'\\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.\\n\\'Give your evidence,\\' said the King; \\'and don\\'t be nervous, or I\\'ll have you executed on the spot.\\'\\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.\\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.\\n\\'I wish you wouldn\\'t squeeze so.\\' said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her.\\n\\'I can hardly breathe.\\'\\n\\'I can\\'t help it,\\' said Alice very meekly: \\'I\\'m growing.\\'\\n\\'You\\'ve no right to grow here,\\' said the Dormouse.\\n\\'Don\\'t talk nonsense,\\' said Alice more boldly: \\'you know you\\'re growing too.\\'\\n\\'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,\\' said the Dormouse: \\'not in that ridiculous fashion.\\' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.\\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \\'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\\' on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\\n\\'Give your evidence,\\' the King repeated angrily, \\'or I\\'ll have you executed, whether you\\'re nervous or not.\\'\\n\\'I\\'m a poor man, your Majesty,\\' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, \\'--and I hadn\\'t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--\\'\\n\\'The twinkling of the what?\\' said the King.\\n\\'It began with the tea,\\' the Hatter replied.\\n\\'Of course twinkling begins with a T!\\' said the King sharply.\\n\\'Do you take me for a dunce?\\nGo on!\\'\\n\\'I\\'m a poor man,\\' the Hatter went on, \\'and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--\\'\\n\\'I didn\\'t!\\' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\\n\\'You did!\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\'I deny it!\\' said the March Hare.\\n\\'He denies it,\\' said the King: \\'leave out that part.\\'\\n\\'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\\' the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.\\n\\'After that,\\' continued the Hatter, \\'I cut some more bread-and-butter--\\'\\n\\'But what did the Dormouse say?\\' one of the jury asked.\\n\\'That I can\\'t remember,\\' said the Hatter.\\n\\'You MUST remember,\\' remarked the King, \\'or I\\'ll have you executed.\\'\\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee.\\n\\'I\\'m a poor man, your Majesty,\\' he began.\\n\\'You\\'re a very poor speaker,\\' said the King.\\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.\\n(As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.\\nThey had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)  \\'I\\'m glad I\\'ve seen that done,\\' thought Alice.\\n\\'I\\'ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.\"\\nand I never understood what it meant till now.\\'\\n\\'If that\\'s all you know about it, you may stand down,\\' continued the King.\\n\\'I can\\'t go no lower,\\' said the Hatter: \\'I\\'m on the floor, as it is.\\'\\n\\'Then you may SIT down,\\' the King replied.\\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\\n\\'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!\\' thought Alice.\\n\\'Now we shall get on better.\\'\\n\\'I\\'d rather finish my tea,\\' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\\n\\'You may go,\\' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.\\n\\'--and just take his head off outside,\\' the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.\\n\\'Call the next witness!\\' said the King.\\nThe next witness was the Duchess\\'s cook.\\nShe carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\n\\'Give your evidence,\\' said the King.\\n\\'Shan\\'t,\\' said the cook.\\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, \\'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.\\'\\n\\'Well, if I must, I must,\\' the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \\'What are tarts made of?\\'\\n\\'Pepper, mostly,\\' said the cook.\\n\\'Treacle,\\' said a sleepy voice behind her.\\n\\'Collar that Dormouse,\\' the Queen shrieked out.\\n\\'Behead that Dormouse!\\nTurn that Dormouse out of court!\\nSuppress him!\\nPinch him!\\nOff with his whiskers!\\'\\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.\\n\\'Never mind!\\' said the King, with an air of great relief.\\n\\'Call the next witness.\\' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \\'Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.\\nIt quite makes my forehead ache!\\'\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \\'--for they haven\\'t got much evidence YET,\\' she said to herself.\\nAlice\\'s Evidence   \\'Here!\\' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\\n\\'Oh, I BEG your pardon!\\' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\\n\\'The trial cannot proceed,\\' said the King in a very grave voice, \\'until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,\\' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.\\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.\\nShe soon got it out again, and put it right; \\'not that it signifies much,\\' she said to herself; \\'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.\\'\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.\\n\\'What do you know about this business?\\' the King said to Alice.\\n\\'Nothing,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Nothing WHATEVER?\\' persisted the King.\\n\\'Nothing whatever,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'That\\'s very important,\\' the King said, turning to the jury.\\nThey were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: \\'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,\\' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\\n\\'UNimportant, of course, I meant,\\' the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,  \\'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--\\' as if he were trying which word sounded best.\\nSome of the jury wrote it down \\'important,\\' and some \\'unimportant.\\' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; \\'but it doesn\\'t matter a bit,\\' she thought to herself.\\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out \\'Silence!\\' and read out from his book, \\'Rule Forty-two.\\nALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.\\'\\nEverybody looked at Alice.\\n\\'I\\'M not a mile high,\\' said Alice.\\n\\'You are,\\' said the King.\\n\\'Nearly two miles high,\\' added the Queen.\\n\\'Well, I shan\\'t go, at any rate,\\' said Alice: \\'besides, that\\'s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.\\'\\n\\'It\\'s the oldest rule in the book,\\' said the King.\\n\\'Then it ought to be Number One,\\' said Alice.\\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.\\n\\'Consider your verdict,\\' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\n\\'There\\'s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\\' said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \\'this paper has just been picked up.\\'\\n\\'What\\'s in it?\\' said the Queen.\\n\\'I haven\\'t opened it yet,\\' said the White Rabbit, \\'but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\\'\\n\\'It must have been that,\\' said the King, \\'unless it was written to nobody, which isn\\'t usual, you know.\\'\\n\\'Who is it directed to?\\' said one of the jurymen.\\n\\'It isn\\'t directed at all,\\' said the White Rabbit; \\'in fact, there\\'s nothing written on the OUTSIDE.\\' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added \\'It isn\\'t a letter, after all: it\\'s a set of verses.\\'\\n\\'Are they in the prisoner\\'s handwriting?\\' asked another of the jurymen.\\n\\'No, they\\'re not,\\' said the White Rabbit, \\'and that\\'s the queerest thing about it.\\' (The jury all looked puzzled.)  \\'He must have imitated somebody else\\'s hand,\\' said the King.\\n(The jury all brightened up again.)  \\'Please your Majesty,\\' said the Knave, \\'I didn\\'t write it, and they can\\'t prove I did: there\\'s no name signed at the end.\\'\\n\\'If you didn\\'t sign it,\\' said the King, \\'that only makes the matter worse.\\nYou MUST have meant some mischief, or else you\\'d have signed your name like an honest man.\\'\\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.\\n\\'That PROVES his guilt,\\' said the Queen.\\n\\'It proves nothing of the sort!\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Why, you don\\'t even know what they\\'re about!\\'\\n\\'Read them,\\' said the King.\\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles.\\n\\'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?\\' he asked.\\n\\'Begin at the beginning,\\' the King said gravely, \\'and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\\'\\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:--     \\'They told me you had been to her,     And mentioned me to him:    She gave me a good character,     But said I could not swim.\\nHe sent them word I had not gone     (We know it to be true):    If she should push the matter on,     What would become of you?\\nI gave her one, they gave him two,     You gave us three or more;    They all returned from him to you,     Though they were mine before.\\nIf I or she should chance to be     Involved in this affair,    He trusts to you to set them free,     Exactly as we were.\\nMy notion was that you had been     (Before she had this fit)    An obstacle that came between     Him, and ourselves, and it.\\nDon\\'t let him know she liked them best,     For this must ever be    A secret, kept from all the rest,     Between yourself and me.\\'\\n\\'That\\'s the most important piece of evidence we\\'ve heard yet,\\' said the King, rubbing his hands; \\'so now let the jury--\\'\\n\\'If any one of them can explain it,\\' said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn\\'t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) \\'I\\'ll give him sixpence.\\n_I_ don\\'t believe there\\'s an atom of meaning in it.\\'\\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, \\'SHE doesn\\'t believe there\\'s an atom of meaning in it,\\' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\\n\\'If there\\'s no meaning in it,\\' said the King, \\'that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn\\'t try to find any.\\nAnd yet I don\\'t know,\\' he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; \\'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\\n\"--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM-.\"\\nyou can\\'t swim, can you?\\' he added, turning to the Knave.\\nThe Knave shook his head sadly.\\n\\'Do I look like it?\\' he said.\\n(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)  \\'All right, so far,\\' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: \\'\"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE-.\"\\nthat\\'s the jury, of course--\"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO-.\"\\nwhy, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--\\'\\n\\'But, it goes on \"THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\"\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Why, there they are!\\' said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table.\\n\\'Nothing can be clearer than THAT.\\nThen again--\"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT-.\"\\nyou never had fits, my dear, I think?\\' he said to the Queen.\\n\\'Never!\\' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.\\n(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)  \\'Then the words don\\'t FIT you,\\' said the King, looking round the court with a smile.\\nThere was a dead silence.\\n\\'It\\'s a pun!\\' the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \\'Let the jury consider their verdict,\\' the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.\\n\\'No, no!\\' said the Queen.\\n\\'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\\'\\n\\'Stuff and nonsense!\\' said Alice loudly.\\n\\'The idea of having the sentence first!\\'\\n\\'Hold your tongue!\\' said the Queen, turning purple.\\n\\'I won\\'t!\\' said Alice.\\n\\'Off with her head!\\' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.\\nNobody moved.\\n\\'Who cares for you?\\' said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \\'You\\'re nothing but a pack of cards!\\'\\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\n\\'Wake up, Alice dear!\\' said her sister; \\'Why, what a long sleep you\\'ve had!\\'\\n\\'Oh, I\\'ve had such a curious dream!\\' said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \\'It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\\'s getting late.\\' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.\\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\\'s dream.\\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess\\'s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard\\'s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.\\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\\'s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\\'s heavy sobs.\\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\\nTHE END      End of Project Gutenberg\\'s Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll\\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer      THE YELLOW WALLPAPER  By Charlotte Perkins Gilman     It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer.\\nA colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity--but that would be asking too much of fate!\\nStill I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.\\nElse, why should it be let so cheaply?\\nAnd why have stood so long untenanted?\\nJohn laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.\\nJohn is practical in the extreme.\\nHe has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.\\nJohn is a physician, and PERHAPS--(I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind)--PERHAPS that is one reason I do not get well faster.\\nYou see he does not believe I am sick!\\nAnd what can one do?\\nIf a physician of high standing, and one\\'s own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression--a slight hysterical tendency--what is one to do?\\nMy brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the same thing.\\nSo I take phosphates or phosphites--whichever it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to \"wor.\"\\nuntil I am well again.\\nPersonally, I disagree with their ideas.\\nPersonally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good.\\nBut what is one to do?\\nI did write for a while in spite of them; but it DOES exhaust me a good deal--having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.\\nI sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus--but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.\\nSo I will let it alone and talk about the house.\\nThe most beautiful place!\\nIt is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village.\\nIt makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.\\nThere is a DELICIOUS garden!\\nI never saw such a garden--large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them.\\nThere were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.\\nThere was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and coheirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\\nThat spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid, but I don\\'t care--there is something strange about the house--I can feel it.\\nI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a DRAUGHT, and shut the window.\\nI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes.\\nI\\'m sure I never used to be so sensitive.\\nI think it is due to this nervous condition.\\nBut John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myself--before him, at least, and that makes me very tired.\\nI don\\'t like our room a bit.\\nI wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings!\\nbut John would not hear of it.\\nHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another.\\nHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction.\\nI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\\nHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get.\\n\"Your exercise depends on your strength, my dear.\"\\nsaid he, \"and your food somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time.\"\\nSo we took the nursery at the top of the house.\\nIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galore.\\nIt was nursery first and then playroom and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\\nThe paint and paper look as if a boys\\' school had used it.\\nIt is stripped off--the paper--in great patches all around the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down.\\nI never saw a worse paper in my life.\\nOne of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin.\\nIt is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study, and when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide--plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard of contradictions.\\nThe color is repellent, almost revolting; a smouldering unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\\nIt is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in others.\\nNo wonder the children hated it!\\nI should hate it myself if I had to live in this room long.\\nThere comes John, and I must put this away,--he hates to have me write a word.\\nWe have been here two weeks, and I haven\\'t felt like writing before, since that first day.\\nI am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength.\\nJohn is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.\\nI am glad my case is not serious!\\nBut these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.\\nJohn does not know how much I really suffer.\\nHe knows there is no REASON to suffer, and that satisfies him.\\nOf course it is only nervousness.\\nIt does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way!\\nI meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative burden already!\\nNobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able,--to dress and entertain, and order things.\\nIt is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby.\\nSuch a dear baby!\\nAnd yet I CANNOT be with him, it makes me so nervous.\\nI suppose John never was nervous in his life.\\nHe laughs at me so about this wall-paper!\\nAt first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\\nHe said that after the wall-paper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of the stairs, and so on.\\n\"You know the place is doing you good.\"\\nhe said, \"and really, dear, I don\\'t care to renovate the house just for a three months\\' rental.\"\\n\"Then do let us go downstairs.\"\\nI said, \"there are such pretty rooms there.\"\\nThen he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and said he would go down to the cellar, if I wished, and have it whitewashed into the bargain.\\nBut he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.\\nIt is an airy and comfortable room as any one need wish, and, of course, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.\\nI\\'m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid paper.\\nOut of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deepshaded arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.\\nOut of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate.\\nThere is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house.\\nI always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least.\\nHe says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making, a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency.\\nSo I try.\\nI think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me.\\nBut I find I get pretty tired when I try.\\nIt is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work.\\nWhen I get really well, John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fireworks in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.\\nI wish I could get well faster.\\nBut I must not think about that.\\nThis paper looks to me as if it KNEW what a vicious influence it had!\\nThere is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside down.\\nI get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness.\\nUp and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere.\\nThere is one place where two breadths didn\\'t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little higher than the other.\\nI never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all know how much expression they have!\\nI used to lie awake as a child and get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than most children could find in a toy store.\\nI remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big, old bureau used to have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.\\nI used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could always hop into that chair and be safe.\\nThe furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for we had to bring it all from downstairs.\\nI suppose when this was used as a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder!\\nI never saw such ravages as the children have made here.\\nThe wall-paper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh closer than a brother--they must have had perseverance as well as hatred.\\nThen the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed which is all we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\\nBut I don\\'t mind it a bit--only the paper.\\nThere comes John\\'s sister.\\nSuch a dear girl as she is, and so careful of me!\\nI must not let her find me writing.\\nShe is a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better profession.\\nI verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me sick!\\nBut I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these windows.\\nThere is one that commands the road, a lovely shaded winding road, and one that just looks off over the country.\\nA lovely country, too, full of great elms and velvet meadows.\\nThis wall-paper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then.\\nBut in the places where it isn\\'t faded and where the sun is just so--I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to skulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.\\nThere\\'s sister on the stairs!\\nWell, the Fourth of July is over!\\nThe people are gone and I am tired out.\\nJohn thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we just had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.\\nOf course I didn\\'t do a thing.\\nJennie sees to everything now.\\nBut it tired me all the same.\\nJohn says if I don\\'t pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in the fall.\\nBut I don\\'t want to go there at all.\\nI had a friend who was in his hands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!\\nBesides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\\nI don\\'t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything, and I\\'m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\\nI cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\\nOf course I don\\'t when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am alone.\\nAnd I am alone a good deal just now.\\nJohn is kept in town very often by serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\\nSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\\nI\\'m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wall-paper.\\nPerhaps BECAUSE of the wall-paper.\\nIt dwells in my mind so!\\nI lie here on this great immovable bed--it is nailed down, I believe--and follow that pattern about by the hour.\\nIt is as good as gymnastics, I assure you.\\nI start, we\\'ll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth time that I WILL follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion.\\nI know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.\\nIt is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.\\nLooked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and flourishes--a kind of \"debased Romanesqu.\"\\nwith delirium tremens--go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.\\nBut, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase.\\nThe whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that direction.\\nThey have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds wonderfully to the confusion.\\nThere is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when the crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can almost fancy radiation after all,--the interminable grotesques seem to form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal distraction.\\nIt makes me tired to follow it.\\nI will take a nap I guess.\\nI don\\'t know why I should write this.\\nI don\\'t want to.\\nI don\\'t feel able.\\nAnd I know John would think it absurd.\\nBut I MUST say what I feel and think in some way--it is such a relief!\\nBut the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.\\nHalf the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.\\nJohn says I musn\\'t lose my strength, and has me take cod liver oil and lots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat.\\nDear John!\\nHe loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick.\\nI tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell him how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and Julia.\\nBut he said I wasn\\'t able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had finished.\\nIt is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight.\\nJust this nervous weakness I suppose.\\nAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my head.\\nHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I must take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.\\nHe says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.\\nThere\\'s one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to occupy this nursery with the horrid wall-paper.\\nIf we had not used it, that blessed child would have!\\nWhat a fortunate escape!\\nWhy, I wouldn\\'t have a child of mine, an impressionable little thing, live in such a room for worlds.\\nI never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here after all, I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.\\nOf course I never mention it to them any more--I am too wise,--but I keep watch of it all the same.\\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern.\\nI don\\'t like it a bit.\\nI wonder--I begin to think--I wish John would take me away from here!\\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise, and because he loves me so.\\nBut I tried it last night.\\nIt was moonlight.\\nThe moon shines in all around just as the sun does.\\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by one window or another.\\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wall-paper till I felt creepy.\\nThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she wanted to get out.\\nI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper DID move, and when I came back John was awake.\\n\"What is it, little girl?\"\\nhe said.\\n\"Don\\'t go walking about like that--you\\'ll get cold.\"\\nI though it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was not gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\\n\"Why darling.\"\\nsaid he, \"our lease will be up in three weeks, and I can\\'t see how to leave before.\\n\"The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just now.\\nOf course if you were in any danger, I could and would, but you really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not.\\nI am a doctor, dear, and I know.\\nYou are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is better, I feel really much easier about you.\"\\n\"I don\\'t weigh a bit more.\"\\nsaid I, \"nor as much; and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here, but it is worse in the morning when you are away.\"\\n\"Bless her little heart.\"\\nsaid he with a big hug, \"she shall be as sick as she pleases!\\nBut now let\\'s improve the shining hours by going to sleep, and talk about it in the morning.\"\\n\"And you won\\'t go away?\"\\nI asked gloomily.\\n\"Why, how can I, dear?\\nIt is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house ready.\\nReally dear you are better.\"\\n\"Better in body perhaps-.\"\\nI began, and stopped short, for he sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I could not say another word.\\n\"My darling.\"\\nsaid he, \"I beg of you, for my sake and for our child\\'s sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let that idea enter your mind!\\nThere is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating, to a temperament like yours.\\nIt is a false and foolish fancy.\\nCan you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?\"\\nSo of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before long.\\nHe thought I was asleep first, but I wasn\\'t, and lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern really did move together or separately.\\nOn a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.\\nThe color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern is torturing.\\nYou think you have mastered it, but just as you get well underway in following, it turns a back-somersault and there you are.\\nIt slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you.\\nIt is like a bad dream.\\nThe outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus.\\nIf you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions--why, that is something like it.\\nThat is, sometimes!\\nThere is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems to notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.\\nWhen the sun shoots in through the east window--I always watch for that first long, straight ray--it changes so quickly that I never can quite believe it.\\nThat is why I watch it always.\\nBy moonlight--the moon shines in all night when there is a moon--I wouldn\\'t know it was the same paper.\\nAt night in any kind of light, in twilight, candle light, lamplight, and worst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars!\\nThe outside pattern I mean, and the woman behind it is as plain as can be.\\nI didn\\'t realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind, that dim sub-pattern, but now I am quite sure it is a woman.\\nBy daylight she is subdued, quiet.\\nI fancy it is the pattern that keeps her so still.\\nIt is so puzzling.\\nIt keeps me quiet by the hour.\\nI lie down ever so much now.\\nJohn says it is good for me, and to sleep all I can.\\nIndeed he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each meal.\\nIt is a very bad habit I am convinced, for you see I don\\'t sleep.\\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don\\'t tell them I\\'m awake--O no!\\nThe fact is I am getting a little afraid of John.\\nHe seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable look.\\nIt strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis,--that perhaps it is the paper!\\nI have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I\\'ve caught him several times LOOKING AT THE PAPER!\\nAnd Jennie too.\\nI caught Jennie with her hand on it once.\\nShe didn\\'t know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a very quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she was doing with the paper--she turned around as if she had been caught stealing, and looked quite angry--asked me why I should frighten her so!\\nThen she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John\\'s, and she wished we would be more careful!\\nDid not that sound innocent?\\nBut I know she was studying that pattern, and I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be.\\nYou see I have something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch.\\nI really do eat better, and am more quiet than I was.\\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve!\\nHe laughed a little the other day, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wall-paper.\\nI turned it off with a laugh.\\nI had no intention of telling him it was BECAUSE of the wall-paper--he would make fun of me.\\nHe might even want to take me away.\\nI don\\'t want to leave now until I have found it out.\\nThere is a week more, and I think that will be enough.\\nI\\'m feeling ever so much better!\\nI don\\'t sleep much at night, for it is so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the daytime.\\nIn the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.\\nThere are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all over it.\\nI cannot keep count of them, though I have tried conscientiously.\\nIt is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper!\\nIt makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw--not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.\\nBut there is something else about that paper--the smell!\\nI noticed it the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was not bad.\\nNow we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows are open or not, the smell is here.\\nIt creeps all over the house.\\nI find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.\\nIt gets into my hair.\\nEven when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it--there is that smell!\\nSuch a peculiar odor, too!\\nI have spent hours in trying to analyze it, to find what it smelled like.\\nIt is not bad--at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most enduring odor I ever met.\\nIn this damp weather it is awful, I wake up in the night and find it hanging over me.\\nIt used to disturb me at first.\\nI thought seriously of burning the house--to reach the smell.\\nBut now I am used to it.\\nThe only thing I can think of that it is like is the COLOR of the paper!\\nA yellow smell.\\nThere is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard.\\nA streak that runs round the room.\\nIt goes behind every piece of furniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even SMOOCH, as if it had been rubbed over and over.\\nI wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for.\\nRound and round and round--round and round and round--it makes me dizzy!\\nI really have discovered something at last.\\nThrough watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out.\\nThe front pattern DOES move--and no wonder!\\nThe woman behind shakes it!\\nSometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over.\\nThen in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\\nAnd she is all the time trying to climb through.\\nBut nobody could climb through that pattern--it strangles so; I think that is why it has so many heads.\\nThey get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside down, and makes their eyes white!\\nIf those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.\\nI think that woman gets out in the daytime!\\nAnd I\\'ll tell you why--privately--I\\'ve seen her!\\nI can see her out of every one of my windows!\\nIt is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women do not creep by daylight.\\nI see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.\\nI don\\'t blame her a bit.\\nIt must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight!\\nI always lock the door when I creep by daylight.\\nI can\\'t do it at night, for I know John would suspect something at once.\\nAnd John is so queer now, that I don\\'t want to irritate him.\\nI wish he would take another room!\\nBesides, I don\\'t want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself.\\nI often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.\\nBut, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.\\nAnd though I always see her, she MAY be able to creep faster than I can turn!\\nI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\\nIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one!\\nI mean to try it, little by little.\\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan\\'t tell it this time!\\nIt does not do to trust people too much.\\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John is beginning to notice.\\nI don\\'t like the look in his eyes.\\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.\\nShe had a very good report to give.\\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\\nJohn knows I don\\'t sleep very well at night, for all I\\'m so quiet!\\nHe asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving and kind.\\nAs if I couldn\\'t see through him!\\nStill, I don\\'t wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three months.\\nIt only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly affected by it.\\nHurrah!\\nThis is the last day, but it is enough.\\nJohn is to stay in town over night, and won\\'t be out until this evening.\\nJennie wanted to sleep with me--the sly thing!\\nbut I told her I should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\\nThat was clever, for really I wasn\\'t alone a bit!\\nAs soon as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I got up and ran to help her.\\nI pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we had peeled off yards of that paper.\\nA strip about as high as my head and half around the room.\\nAnd then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me, I declared I would finish it to-day!\\nWe go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to leave things as they were before.\\nJennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.\\nShe laughed and said she wouldn\\'t mind doing it herself, but I must not get tired.\\nHow she betrayed herself that time!\\nBut I am here, and no person touches this paper but me--not ALIVE!\\nShe tried to get me out of the room--it was too patent!\\nBut I said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner--I would call when I woke.\\nSo now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone, and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the canvas mattress we found on it.\\nWe shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.\\nI quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.\\nHow those children did tear about here!\\nThis bedstead is fairly gnawed!\\nBut I must get to work.\\nI have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\\nI don\\'t want to go out, and I don\\'t want to have anybody come in, till John comes.\\nI want to astonish him.\\nI\\'ve got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find.\\nIf that woman does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\\nBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\\nThis bed will NOT move!\\nI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I bit off a little piece at one corner--but it hurt my teeth.\\nThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor.\\nIt sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it!\\nAll those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision!\\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate.\\nTo jump out of the window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to try.\\nBesides I wouldn\\'t do it.\\nOf course not.\\nI know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued.\\nI don\\'t like to LOOK out of the windows even--there are so many of those creeping women, and they creep so fast.\\nI wonder if they all come out of that wall-paper as I did?\\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope--you don\\'t get ME out in the road there!\\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night, and that is hard!\\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please!\\nI don\\'t want to go outside.\\nI won\\'t, even if Jennie asks me to.\\nFor outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow.\\nBut here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.\\nWhy there\\'s John at the door!\\nIt is no use, young man, you can\\'t open it!\\nHow he does call and pound!\\nNow he\\'s crying for an axe.\\nIt would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!\\n\"John dear.\"\\nsaid I in the gentlest voice, \"the key is down by the front steps, under a plantain leaf.\"\\nThat silenced him for a few moments.\\nThen he said--very quietly indeed, \"Open the door, my darling.\"\\n\"I can\\'t.\"\\nsaid I.\\n\"The key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf.\"\\nAnd then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it of course, and came in.\\nHe stopped short by the door.\\n\"What is the matter?\"\\nhe cried.\\n\"For God\\'s sake, what are you doing.\"\\nI kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.\\n\"I\\'ve got out at last.\"\\nsaid I, \"in spite of you and Jane.\\nAnd I\\'ve pulled off most of the paper, so you can\\'t put me back.\"\\nNow why should that man have fainted?\\nBut he did, and right across my path by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman\\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer and David Widger              Note from

THE YEAR 1845 BY FREDERICK DOUGLASS, IN THE CLERK\\'S OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS.\\nCONTENTS     PREFACE   LETTER FROM WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.\\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS.\\nHe was a stranger to nearly every member of that body; but, having recently made his escape from the southern prison-house of bondage, and feeling his curiosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of the abolitionists,--of whom he had heard a somewhat vague description while he was a slave,--he was induced to give his attendance, on the occasion alluded to, though at that time a resident in New Bedford.\\nFortunate, most fortunate occurrence!--fortunate for the millions of his manacled brethren, yet panting for deliverance from their awful thraldom!--fortunate for the cause of negro emancipation, and of universal liberty!--fortunate for the land of his birth, which he has already done so much to save and bless!--fortunate for a large circle of friends and acquaintances, whose sympathy and affection he has strongly secured by the many sufferings he has endured, by his virtuous traits of character, by his ever-abiding remembrance of those who are in bonds, as being bound with them!--fortunate for the multitudes, in various parts of our republic, whose minds he has enlightened on the subject of slavery, and who have been melted to tears by his pathos, or roused to virtuous indignation by his stirring eloquence against the enslavers of men!--fortunate for himself, as it at once brought him into the field of public usefulness, \"gave the world assurance of a MAN.\"\\nquickened the slumbering energies of his soul, and consecrated him to the great work of breaking the rod of the oppressor, and letting the oppressed go free!\\nI shall never forget his first speech at the convention--the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind--the powerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory, completely taken by surprise--the applause which followed from the beginning to the end of his felicitous remarks.\\nI think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment; certainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted by it, on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered far more clear than ever.\\nThere stood one, in physical proportion and stature commanding and exact--in intellect richly endowed--in natural eloquence a prodigy--in soul manifestly \"created but a little lower than the angels\"--yet a slave, ay, a fugitive slave,--trembling for his safety, hardly daring to believe that on the American soil, a single white person could be found who would befriend him at all hazards, for the love of God and humanity!\\nCapable of high attainments as an intellectual and moral being--needing nothing but a comparatively small amount of cultivation to make him an ornament to society and a blessing to his race--by the law of the land, by the voice of the people, by the terms of the slave code, he was only a piece of property, a beast of burden, a chattel personal, nevertheless!\\nA beloved friend from New Bedford prevailed on _Mr.\\nDouglass_ to address the convention: He came forward to the platform with a hesitancy and embarrassment, necessarily the attendants of a sensitive mind in such a novel position.\\nAfter apologizing for his ignorance, and reminding the audience that slavery was a poor school for the human intellect and heart, he proceeded to narrate some of the facts in his own history as a slave, and in the course of his speech gave utterance to many noble thoughts and thrilling reflections.\\nAs soon as he had taken his seat, filled with hope and admiration, I rose, and declared that _Patrick Henry_, of revolutionary fame, never made a speech more eloquent in the cause of liberty, than the one we had just listened to from the lips of that hunted fugitive.\\nSo I believed at that time--such is my belief now.\\nI reminded the audience of the peril which surrounded this self-emancipated young man at the North,--even in Massachusetts, on the soil of the Pilgrim Fathers, among the descendants of revolutionary sires; and I appealed to them, whether they would ever allow him to be carried back into slavery,--law or no law, constitution or no constitution.\\nThe response was unanimous and in thunder-tones--\"NO.\"\\n\"Will you succor and protect him as a brother-man--a resident of the old Bay State?\"\\n\"YES.\"\\nshouted the whole mass, with an energy so startling, that the ruthless tyrants south of Mason and Dixon\\'s line might almost have heard the mighty burst of feeling, and recognized it as the pledge of an invincible determination, on the part of those who gave it, never to betray him that wanders, but to hide the outcast, and firmly to abide the consequences.\\nIt was at once deeply impressed upon my mind, that, if _Mr.\\nDouglass_ could be persuaded to consecrate his time and talents to the promotion of the anti-slavery enterprise, a powerful impetus would be given to it, and a stunning blow at the same time inflicted on northern prejudice against a colored complexion.\\nI therefore endeavored to instil hope and courage into his mind, in order that he might dare to engage in a vocation so anomalous and responsible for a person in his situation; and I was seconded in this effort by warm-hearted friends, especially by the late General Agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, _Mr.\\nJohn A.\\nCollins_, whose judgment in this instance entirely coincided with my own.\\nAt first, he could give no encouragement; with unfeigned diffidence, he expressed his conviction that he was not adequate to the performance of so great a task; the path marked out was wholly an untrodden one; he was sincerely apprehensive that he should do more harm than good.\\nAfter much deliberation, however, he consented to make a trial; and ever since that period, he has acted as a lecturing agent, under the auspices either of the American or the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society.\\nIn labors he has been most abundant; and his success in combating prejudice, in gaining proselytes, in agitating the public mind, has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations that were raised at the commencement of his brilliant career.\\nHe has borne himself with gentleness and meekness, yet with true manliness of character.\\nAs a public speaker, he excels in pathos, wit, comparison, imitation, strength of reasoning, and fluency of language.\\nThere is in him that union of head and heart, which is indispensable to an enlightenment of the heads and a winning of the hearts of others.\\nMay his strength continue to be equal to his day!\\nMay he continue to \"grow in grace, and in the knowledge of God.\"\\nthat he may be increasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding humanity, whether at home or abroad!\\nIt is certainly a very remarkable fact, that one of the most efficient advocates of the slave population, now before the public, is a fugitive slave, in the person of _Frederick Douglass_; and that the free colored population of the United States are as ably represented by one of their own number, in the person of _Charles Lenox Remond_, whose eloquent appeals have extorted the highest applause of multitudes on both sides of the Atlantic.\\nLet the calumniators of the colored race despise themselves for their baseness and illiberality of spirit, and henceforth cease to talk of the natural inferiority of those who require nothing but time and opportunity to attain to the highest point of human excellence.\\nIt may, perhaps, be fairly questioned, whether any other portion of the population of the earth could have endured the privations, sufferings and horrors of slavery, without having become more degraded in the scale of humanity than the slaves of African descent.\\nNothing has been left undone to cripple their intellects, darken their minds, debase their moral nature, obliterate all traces of their relationship to mankind; and yet how wonderfully they have sustained the mighty load of a most frightful bondage, under which they have been groaning for centuries!\\nTo illustrate the effect of slavery on the white man,--to show that he has no powers of endurance, in such a condition, superior to those of his black brother,--_Daniel O\\'connell_, the distinguished advocate of universal emancipation, and the mightiest champion of prostrate but not conquered Ireland, relates the following anecdote in a speech delivered by him in the Conciliation Hall, Dublin, before the Loyal National Repeal Association, March 31, 1845.\\n\"No matter.\"\\nsaid _Mr.\\nO\\'connell_, \"under what specious term it may disguise itself, slavery is still hideous.\\n_It has a natural, an inevitable tendency to brutalize every noble faculty of man._ An American sailor, who was cast away on the shore of Africa, where he was kept in slavery for three years, was, at the expiration of that period, found to be imbruted and stultified--he had lost all reasoning power; and having forgotten his native language, could only utter some savage gibberish between Arabic and English, which nobody could understand, and which even he himself found difficulty in pronouncing.\\nSo much for the humanizing influence of _The Domestic Institution_.\"\\nAdmitting this to have been an extraordinary case of mental deterioration, it proves at least that the white slave can sink as low in the scale of humanity as the black one.\\n_Mr.\\nDouglass_ has very properly chosen to write his own Narrative, in his own style, and according to the best of his ability, rather than to employ some one else.\\nIt is, therefore, entirely his own production; and, considering how long and dark was the career he had to run as a slave,--how few have been his opportunities to improve his mind since he broke his iron fetters,--it is, in my judgment, highly creditable to his head and heart.\\nHe who can peruse it without a tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit,--without being filled with an unutterable abhorrence of slavery and all its abettors, and animated with a determination to seek the immediate overthrow of that execrable system,--without trembling for the fate of this country in the hands of a righteous God, who is ever on the side of the oppressed, and whose arm is not shortened that it cannot save,--must have a flinty heart, and be qualified to act the part of a trafficker \"in slaves and the souls of men.\"\\nI am confident that it is essentially true in all its statements; that nothing has been set down in malice, nothing exaggerated, nothing drawn from the imagination; that it comes short of the reality, rather than overstates a single fact in regard to _slavery as it is_.\\nThe experience of _Frederick Douglass_, as a slave, was not a peculiar one; his lot was not especially a hard one; his case may be regarded as a very fair specimen of the treatment of slaves in Maryland, in which State it is conceded that they are better fed and less cruelly treated than in Georgia, Alabama, or Louisiana.\\nMany have suffered incomparably more, while very few on the plantations have suffered less, than himself.\\nYet how deplorable was his situation!\\nwhat terrible chastisements were inflicted upon his person!\\nwhat still more shocking outrages were perpetrated upon his mind!\\nwith all his noble powers and sublime aspirations, how like a brute was he treated, even by those professing to have the same mind in them that was in Christ Jesus!\\nto what dreadful liabilities was he continually subjected!\\nhow destitute of friendly counsel and aid, even in his greatest extremities!\\nhow heavy was the midnight of woe which shrouded in blackness the last ray of hope, and filled the future with terror and gloom!\\nwhat longings after freedom took possession of his breast, and how his misery augmented, in proportion as he grew reflective and intelligent,--thus demonstrating that a happy slave is an extinct man!\\nhow he thought, reasoned, felt, under the lash of the driver, with the chains upon his limbs!\\nwhat perils he encountered in his endeavors to escape from his horrible doom!\\nand how signal have been his deliverance and preservation in the midst of a nation of pitiless enemies!\\nThis Narrative contains many affecting incidents, many passages of great eloquence and power; but I think the most thrilling one of them all is the description _Douglass_ gives of his feelings, as he stood soliloquizing respecting his fate, and the chances of his one day being a freeman, on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay--viewing the receding vessels as they flew with their white wings before the breeze, and apostrophizing them as animated by the living spirit of freedom.\\nWho can read that passage, and be insensible to its pathos and sublimity?\\nCompressed into it is a whole Alexandrian library of thought, feeling, and sentiment--all that can, all that need be urged, in the form of expostulation, entreaty, rebuke, against that crime of crimes,--making man the property of his fellow-man!\\nO, how accursed is that system, which entombs the godlike mind of man, defaces the divine image, reduces those who by creation were crowned with glory and honor to a level with four-footed beasts, and exalts the dealer in human flesh above all that is called God!\\nWhy should its existence be prolonged one hour?\\nIs it not evil, only evil, and that continually?\\nWhat does its presence imply but the absence of all fear of God, all regard for man, on the part of the people of the United States?\\nHeaven speed its eternal overthrow!\\nSo profoundly ignorant of the nature of slavery are many persons, that they are stubbornly incredulous whenever they read or listen to any recital of the cruelties which are daily inflicted on its victims.\\nThey do not deny that the slaves are held as property; but that terrible fact seems to convey to their minds no idea of injustice, exposure to outrage, or savage barbarity.\\nTell them of cruel scourgings, of mutilations and brandings, of scenes of pollution and blood, of the banishment of all light and knowledge, and they affect to be greatly indignant at such enormous exaggerations, such wholesale misstatements, such abominable libels on the character of the southern planters!\\nAs if all these direful outrages were not the natural results of slavery!\\nAs if it were less cruel to reduce a human being to the condition of a thing, than to give him a severe flagellation, or to deprive him of necessary food and clothing!\\nAs if whips, chains, thumb-screws, paddles, blood-hounds, overseers, drivers, patrols, were not all indispensable to keep the slaves down, and to give protection to their ruthless oppressors!\\nAs if, when the marriage institution is abolished, concubinage, adultery, and incest, must not necessarily abound; when all the rights of humanity are annihilated, any barrier remains to protect the victim from the fury of the spoiler; when absolute power is assumed over life and liberty, it will not be wielded with destructive sway!\\nSkeptics of this character abound in society.\\nIn some few instances, their incredulity arises from a want of reflection; but, generally, it indicates a hatred of the light, a desire to shield slavery from the assaults of its foes, a contempt of the colored race, whether bond or free.\\nSuch will try to discredit the shocking tales of slaveholding cruelty which are recorded in this truthful Narrative; but they will labor in vain.\\n_Mr.\\nDouglass_ has frankly disclosed the place of his birth, the names of those who claimed ownership in his body and soul, and the names also of those who committed the crimes which he has alleged against them.\\nHis statements, therefore, may easily be disproved, if they are untrue.\\nIn the course of his Narrative, he relates two instances of murderous cruelty,--in one of which a planter deliberately shot a slave belonging to a neighboring plantation, who had unintentionally gotten within his lordly domain in quest of fish; and in the other, an overseer blew out the brains of a slave who had fled to a stream of water to escape a bloody scourging.\\n_Mr.\\nDouglass_ states that in neither of these instances was any thing done by way of legal arrest or judicial investigation.\\nThe Baltimore American, of March 17, 1845, relates a similar case of atrocity, perpetrated with similar impunity--as follows:--\"_Shooting a slave._--We learn, upon the authority of a letter from Charles county, Maryland, received by a gentleman of this city, that a young man, named Matthews, a nephew of General Matthews, and whose father, it is believed, holds an office at Washington, killed one of the slaves upon his father\\'s farm by shooting him.\\nThe letter states that young Matthews had been left in charge of the farm; that he gave an order to the servant, which was disobeyed, when he proceeded to the house, _obtained a gun, and, returning, shot the servant._ He immediately, the letter continues, fled to his father\\'s residence, where he still remains unmolested.\"--Let it never be forgotten, that no slaveholder or overseer can be convicted of any outrage perpetrated on the person of a slave, however diabolical it may be, on the testimony of colored witnesses, whether bond or free.\\nBy the slave code, they are adjudged to be as incompetent to testify against a white man, as though they were indeed a part of the brute creation.\\nHence, there is no legal protection in fact, whatever there may be in form, for the slave population; and any amount of cruelty may be inflicted on them with impunity.\\nIs it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society?\\nThe effect of a religious profession on the conduct of southern masters is vividly described in the following Narrative, and shown to be any thing but salutary.\\nIn the nature of the case, it must be in the highest degree pernicious.\\nThe testimony of _Mr.\\nDouglass_, on this point, is sustained by a cloud of witnesses, whose veracity is unimpeachable.\\n\"A slaveholder\\'s profession of Christianity is a palpable imposture.\\nHe is a felon of the highest grade.\\nHe is a man-stealer.\\nIt is of no importance what you put in the other scale.\"\\nReader!\\nare you with the man-stealers in sympathy and purpose, or on the side of their down-trodden victims?\\nIf with the former, then are you the foe of God and man.\\nIf with the latter, what are you prepared to do and dare in their behalf?\\nBe faithful, be vigilant, be untiring in your efforts to break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free.\\nCome what may--cost what it may--inscribe on the banner which you unfurl to the breeze, as your religious and political motto--\"NO COMPROMISE WITH SLAVERY!\\nNO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.\"\\nWM.\\nLLOYD GARRISON BOSTON, _May_ 1, 1845.\\nLETTER FROM WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.\\nBOSTON, APRIL 22, 1845.\\nMy Dear Friend:  You remember the old fable of \"The Man and the Lion.\"\\nwhere the lion complained that he should not be so misrepresented \"when the lions wrote history.\"\\nI am glad the time has come when the \"lions write history.\"\\nWe have been left long enough to gather the character of slavery from the involuntary evidence of the masters.\\nOne might, indeed, rest sufficiently satisfied with what, it is evident, must be, in general, the results of such a relation, without seeking farther to find whether they have followed in every instance.\\nIndeed, those who stare at the half-peck of corn a week, and love to count the lashes on the slave\\'s back, are seldom the \"stuf.\"\\nout of which reformers and abolitionists are to be made.\\nI remember that, in 1838, many were waiting for the results of the West India experiment, before they could come into our ranks.\\nThose \"result.\"\\nhave come long ago; but, alas!\\nfew of that number have come with them, as converts.\\nA man must be disposed to judge of emancipation by other tests than whether it has increased the produce of sugar,--and to hate slavery for other reasons than because it starves men and whips women,--before he is ready to lay the first stone of his anti-slavery life.\\nI was glad to learn, in your story, how early the most neglected of God\\'s children waken to a sense of their rights, and of the injustice done them.\\nExperience is a keen teacher; and long before you had mastered your A B C, or knew where the \"white sail.\"\\nof the Chesapeake were bound, you began, I see, to gauge the wretchedness of the slave, not by his hunger and want, not by his lashes and toil, but by the cruel and blighting death which gathers over his soul.\\nIn connection with this, there is one circumstance which makes your recollections peculiarly valuable, and renders your early insight the more remarkable.\\nYou come from that part of the country where we are told slavery appears with its fairest features.\\nLet us hear, then, what it is at its best estate--gaze on its bright side, if it has one; and then imagination may task her powers to add dark lines to the picture, as she travels southward to that (for the colored man) Valley of the Shadow of Death, where the Mississippi sweeps along.\\nAgain, we have known you long, and can put the most entire confidence in your truth, candor, and sincerity.\\nEvery one who has heard you speak has felt, and, I am confident, every one who reads your book will feel, persuaded that you give them a fair specimen of the whole truth.\\nNo one-sided portrait,--no wholesale complaints,--but strict justice done, whenever individual kindliness has neutralized, for a moment, the deadly system with which it was strangely allied.\\nYou have been with us, too, some years, and can fairly compare the twilight of rights, which your race enjoy at the North, with that \"noon of nigh.\"\\nunder which they labor south of Mason and Dixon\\'s line.\\nTell us whether, after all, the half-free colored man of Massachusetts is worse off than the pampered slave of the rice swamps!\\nIn reading your life, no one can say that we have unfairly picked out some rare specimens of cruelty.\\nWe know that the bitter drops, which even you have drained from the cup, are no incidental aggravations, no individual ills, but such as must mingle always and necessarily in the lot of every slave.\\nThey are the essential ingredients, not the occasional results, of the system.\\nAfter all, I shall read your book with trembling for you.\\nSome years ago, when you were beginning to tell me your real name and birthplace, you may remember I stopped you, and preferred to remain ignorant of all.\\nWith the exception of a vague description, so I continued, till the other day, when you read me your memoirs.\\nI hardly knew, at the time, whether to thank you or not for the sight of them, when I reflected that it was still dangerous, in Massachusetts, for honest men to tell their names!\\nThey say the fathers, in 1776, signed the Declaration of Independence with the halter about their necks.\\nYou, too, publish your declaration of freedom with danger compassing you around.\\nIn all the broad lands which the Constitution of the United States overshadows, there is no single spot,--however narrow or desolate,--where a fugitive slave can plant himself and say, \"I am safe.\"\\nThe whole armory of Northern Law has no shield for you.\\nI am free to say that, in your place, I should throw the MS.\\ninto the fire.\\nYou, perhaps, may tell your story in safety, endeared as you are to so many warm hearts by rare gifts, and a still rarer devotion of them to the service of others.\\nBut it will be owing only to your labors, and the fearless efforts of those who, trampling the laws and Constitution of the country under their feet, are determined that they will \"hide the outcast.\"\\nand that their hearths shall be, spite of the law, an asylum for the oppressed, if, some time or other, the humblest may stand in our streets, and bear witness in safety against the cruelties of which he has been the victim.\\nYet it is sad to think, that these very throbbing hearts which welcome your story, and form your best safeguard in telling it, are all beating contrary to the \"statute in such case made and provided.\"\\nGo on, my dear friend, till you, and those who, like you, have been saved, so as by fire, from the dark prison-house, shall stereotype these free, illegal pulses into statutes; and New England, cutting loose from a blood-stained Union, shall glory in being the house of refuge for the oppressed,--till we no longer merely \"_hide_ the outcast.\"\\nor make a merit of standing idly by while he is hunted in our midst; but, consecrating anew the soil of the Pilgrims as an asylum for the oppressed, proclaim our _welcome_ to the slave so loudly, that the tones shall reach every hut in the Carolinas, and make the broken-hearted bondman leap up at the thought of old Massachusetts.\\nGod speed the day!\\n_Till then, and ever,_ Yours truly, WENDELL PHILLIPS       FREDERICK DOUGLASS.\\nFrederick Douglass was born in slavery as Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey near Easton in Talbot County, Maryland.\\nHe was not sure of the exact year of his birth, but he knew that it was 1817 or 1818.\\nAs a young boy he was sent to Baltimore, to be a house servant, where he learned to read and write, with the assistance of his master\\'s wife.\\nIn 1838 he escaped from slavery and went to New York City, where he married Anna Murray, a free colored woman whom he had met in Baltimore.\\nSoon thereafter he changed his name to Frederick Douglass.\\nIn 1841 he addressed a convention of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in Nantucket and so greatly impressed the group that they immediately employed him as an agent.\\nHe was such an impressive orator that numerous persons doubted if he had ever been a slave, so he wrote _Narrative Of The Life Of Frederick Douglass_.\\nDuring the Civil War he assisted in the recruiting of colored men for the 54th and 55th Massachusetts Regiments and consistently argued for the emancipation of slaves.\\nAfter the war he was active in securing and protecting the rights of the freemen.\\nIn his later years, at different times, he was secretary of the Santo Domingo Commission, marshall and recorder of deeds of the District of Columbia, and United States Minister to Haiti.\\nHis other autobiographical works are _My Bondage And My Freedom_ and _Life And Times Of Frederick Douglass_, published in 1855 and 1881 respectively.\\nHe died in 1895.\\nI have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it.\\nBy far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant.\\nI do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday.\\nThey seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvest-time, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time.\\nA want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood.\\nThe white children could tell their ages.\\nI could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege.\\nI was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it.\\nHe deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit.\\nThe nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age.\\nI come to this, from hearing my master say, some time during 1835, I was about seventeen years old.\\nMy mother was named Harriet Bailey.\\nShe was the daughter of Isaac and Betsey Bailey, both colored, and quite dark.\\nMy mother was of a darker complexion than either my grandmother or grandfather.\\nMy father was a white man.\\nHe was admitted to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage.\\nThe opinion was also whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion, I know nothing; the means of knowing was withheld from me.\\nMy mother and I were separated when I was but an infant--before I knew her as my mother.\\nIt is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age.\\nFrequently, before the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and the child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field labor.\\nFor what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it be to hinder the development of the child\\'s affection toward its mother, and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child.\\nThis is the inevitable result.\\nI never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five times in my life; and each of these times was very short in duration, and at night.\\nShe was hired by a Mr.\\nStewart, who lived about twelve miles from my home.\\nShe made her journeys to see me in the night, travelling the whole distance on foot, after the performance of her day\\'s work.\\nShe was a field hand, and a whipping is the penalty of not being in the field at sunrise, unless a slave has special permission from his or her master to the contrary--a permission which they seldom get, and one that gives to him that gives it the proud name of being a kind master.\\nI do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day.\\nShe was with me in the night.\\nShe would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she was gone.\\nVery little communication ever took place between us.\\nDeath soon ended what little we could have while she lived, and with it her hardships and suffering.\\nShe died when I was about seven years old, on one of my master\\'s farms, near Lee\\'s Mill.\\nI was not allowed to be present during her illness, at her death, or burial.\\nShe was gone long before I knew any thing about it.\\nNever having enjoyed, to any considerable extent, her soothing presence, her tender and watchful care, I received the tidings of her death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger.\\nCalled thus suddenly away, she left me without the slightest intimation of who my father was.\\nThe whisper that my master was my father, may or may not be true; and, true or false, it is of but little consequence to my purpose whilst the fact remains, in all its glaring odiousness, that slaveholders have ordained, and by law established, that the children of slave women shall in all cases follow the condition of their mothers; and this is done too obviously to administer to their own lusts, and make a gratification of their wicked desires profitable as well as pleasurable; for by this cunning arrangement, the slaveholder, in cases not a few, sustains to his slaves the double relation of master and father.\\nI know of such cases; and it is worthy of remark that such slaves invariably suffer greater hardships, and have more to contend with, than others.\\nThey are, in the first place, a constant offence to their mistress.\\nShe is ever disposed to find fault with them; they can seldom do any thing to please her; she is never better pleased than when she sees them under the lash, especially when she suspects her husband of showing to his mulatto children favors which he withholds from his black slaves.\\nThe master is frequently compelled to sell this class of his slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his white wife; and, cruel as the deed may strike any one to be, for a man to sell his own children to human flesh-mongers, it is often the dictate of humanity for him to do so; for, unless he does this, he must not only whip them himself, but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother, of but few shades darker complexion than himself, and ply the gory lash to his naked back; and if he lisp one word of disapproval, it is set down to his parental partiality, and only makes a bad matter worse, both for himself and the slave whom he would protect and defend.\\nEvery year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves.\\nIt was doubtless in consequence of a knowledge of this fact, that one great statesman of the south predicted the downfall of slavery by the inevitable laws of population.\\nWhether this prophecy is ever fulfilled or not, it is nevertheless plain that a very different-looking class of people are springing up at the south, and are now held in slavery, from those originally brought to this country from Africa; and if their increase do no other good, it will do away the force of the argument, that God cursed Ham, and therefore American slavery is right.\\nIf the lineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally enslaved, it is certain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural; for thousands are ushered into the world, annually, who, like myself, owe their existence to white fathers, and those fathers most frequently their own masters.\\nI have had two masters.\\nMy first master\\'s name was Anthony.\\nI do not remember his first name.\\nHe was generally called Captain Anthony--a title which, I presume, he acquired by sailing a craft on the Chesapeake Bay.\\nHe was not considered a rich slaveholder.\\nHe owned two or three farms, and about thirty slaves.\\nHis farms and slaves were under the care of an overseer.\\nThe overseer\\'s name was Plummer.\\nMr.\\nPlummer was a miserable drunkard, a profane swearer, and a savage monster.\\nHe always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel.\\nI have known him to cut and slash the women\\'s heads so horribly, that even master would be enraged at his cruelty, and would threaten to whip him if he did not mind himself.\\nMaster, however, was not a humane slaveholder.\\nIt required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an overseer to affect him.\\nHe was a cruel man, hardened by a long life of slaveholding.\\nHe would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping a slave.\\nI have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most heart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine, whom he used to tie up to a joist, and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered with blood.\\nNo words, no tears, no prayers, from his gory victim, seemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose.\\nThe louder she screamed, the harder he whipped; and where the blood ran fastest, there he whipped longest.\\nHe would whip her to make her scream, and whip her to make her hush; and not until overcome by fatigue, would he cease to swing the blood-clotted cowskin.\\nI remember the first time I ever witnessed this horrible exhibition.\\nI was quite a child, but I well remember it.\\nI never shall forget it whilst I remember any thing.\\nIt was the first of a long series of such outrages, of which I was doomed to be a witness and a participant.\\nIt struck me with awful force.\\nIt was the blood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery, through which I was about to pass.\\nIt was a most terrible spectacle.\\nI wish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it.\\nThis occurrence took place very soon after I went to live with my old master, and under the following circumstances.\\nAunt Hester went out one night,--where or for what I do not know,--and happened to be absent when my master desired her presence.\\nHe had ordered her not to go out evenings, and warned her that she must never let him catch her in company with a young man, who was paying attention to her belonging to Colonel Lloyd.\\nThe young man\\'s name was Ned Roberts, generally called Lloyd\\'s Ned.\\nWhy master was so careful of her, may be safely left to conjecture.\\nShe was a woman of noble form, and of graceful proportions, having very few equals, and fewer superiors, in personal appearance, among the colored or white women of our neighborhood.\\nAunt Hester had not only disobeyed his orders in going out, but had been found in company with Lloyd\\'s Ned; which circumstance, I found, from what he said while whipping her, was the chief offence.\\nHad he been a man of pure morals himself, he might have been thought interested in protecting the innocence of my aunt; but those who knew him will not suspect him of any such virtue.\\nBefore he commenced whipping Aunt Hester, he took her into the kitchen, and stripped her from neck to waist, leaving her neck, shoulders, and back, entirely naked.\\nHe then told her to cross her hands, calling her at the same time a d----d b---h.\\nAfter crossing her hands, he tied them with a strong rope, and led her to a stool under a large hook in the joist, put in for the purpose.\\nHe made her get upon the stool, and tied her hands to the hook.\\nShe now stood fair for his infernal purpose.\\nHer arms were stretched up at their full length, so that she stood upon the ends of her toes.\\nHe then said to her, \"Now, you d----d b---h, I\\'ll learn you how to disobey my orders.\"\\nand after rolling up his sleeves, he commenced to lay on the heavy cowskin, and soon the warm, red blood (amid heart-rending shrieks from her, and horrid oaths from him) came dripping to the floor.\\nI was so terrified and horror-stricken at the sight, that I hid myself in a closet, and dared not venture out till long after the bloody transaction was over.\\nI expected it would be my turn next.\\nIt was all new to me.\\nI had never seen any thing like it before.\\nI had always lived with my grandmother on the outskirts of the plantation, where she was put to raise the children of the younger women.\\nI had therefore been, until now, out of the way of the bloody scenes that often occurred on the plantation.\\nThey lived in one house, upon the home plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd.\\nMy master was Colonel Lloyd\\'s clerk and superintendent.\\nHe was what might be called the overseer of the overseers.\\nI spent two years of childhood on this plantation in my old master\\'s family.\\nIt was here that I witnessed the bloody transaction recorded in the first chapter; and as I received my first impressions of slavery on this plantation, I will give some description of it, and of slavery as it there existed.\\nThe plantation is about twelve miles north of Easton, in Talbot county, and is situated on the border of Miles River.\\nThe principal products raised upon it were tobacco, corn, and wheat.\\nThese were raised in great abundance; so that, with the products of this and the other farms belonging to him, he was able to keep in almost constant employment a large sloop, in carrying them to market at Baltimore.\\nThis sloop was named Sally Lloyd, in honor of one of the colonel\\'s daughters.\\nMy master\\'s son-in-law, Captain Auld, was master of the vessel; she was otherwise manned by the colonel\\'s own slaves.\\nTheir names were Peter, Isaac, Rich, and Jake.\\nThese were esteemed very highly by the other slaves, and looked upon as the privileged ones of the plantation; for it was no small affair, in the eyes of the slaves, to be allowed to see Baltimore.\\nColonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation, and owned a large number more on the neighboring farms belonging to him.\\nThe names of the farms nearest to the home plantation were Wye Town and New Design.\\n\"Wye Tow.\"\\nwas under the overseership of a man named Noah Willis.\\nNew Design was under the overseership of a Mr.\\nTownsend.\\nThe overseers of these, and all the rest of the farms, numbering over twenty, received advice and direction from the managers of the home plantation.\\nThis was the great business place.\\nIt was the seat of government for the whole twenty farms.\\nAll disputes among the overseers were settled here.\\nIf a slave was convicted of any high misdemeanor, became unmanageable, or evinced a determination to run away, he was brought immediately here, severely whipped, put on board the sloop, carried to Baltimore, and sold to Austin Woolfolk, or some other slave-trader, as a warning to the slaves remaining.\\nHere, too, the slaves of all the other farms received their monthly allowance of food, and their yearly clothing.\\nThe men and women slaves received, as their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pork, or its equivalent in fish, and one bushel of corn meal.\\nTheir yearly clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts, one pair of linen trousers, like the shirts, one jacket, one pair of trousers for winter, made of coarse negro cloth, one pair of stockings, and one pair of shoes; the whole of which could not have cost more than seven dollars.\\nThe allowance of the slave children was given to their mothers, or the old women having the care of them.\\nThe children unable to work in the field had neither shoes, stockings, jackets, nor trousers, given to them; their clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year.\\nWhen these failed them, they went naked until the next allowance-day.\\nChildren from seven to ten years old, of both sexes, almost naked, might be seen at all seasons of the year.\\nThere were no beds given the slaves, unless one coarse blanket be considered such, and none but the men and women had these.\\nThis, however, is not considered a very great privation.\\nThey find less difficulty from the want of beds, than from the want of time to sleep; for when their day\\'s work in the field is done, the most of them having their washing, mending, and cooking to do, and having few or none of the ordinary facilities for doing either of these, very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in preparing for the field the coming day; and when this is done, old and young, male and female, married and single, drop down side by side, on one common bed,--the cold, damp floor,--each covering himself or herself with their miserable blankets; and here they sleep till they are summoned to the field by the driver\\'s horn.\\nAt the sound of this, all must rise, and be off to the field.\\nThere must be no halting; every one must be at his or her post; and woe betides them who hear not this morning summons to the field; for if they are not awakened by the sense of hearing, they are by the sense of feeling: no age nor sex finds any favor.\\nMr.\\nSevere, the overseer, used to stand by the door of the quarter, armed with a large hickory stick and heavy cowskin, ready to whip any one who was so unfortunate as not to hear, or, from any other cause, was prevented from being ready to start for the field at the sound of the horn.\\nMr.\\nSevere was rightly named: he was a cruel man.\\nI have seen him whip a woman, causing the blood to run half an hour at the time; and this, too, in the midst of her crying children, pleading for their mother\\'s release.\\nHe seemed to take pleasure in manifesting his fiendish barbarity.\\nAdded to his cruelty, he was a profane swearer.\\nIt was enough to chill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary man to hear him talk.\\nScarce a sentence escaped him but that was commenced or concluded by some horrid oath.\\nThe field was the place to witness his cruelty and profanity.\\nHis presence made it both the field of blood and of blasphemy.\\nFrom the rising till the going down of the sun, he was cursing, raving, cutting, and slashing among the slaves of the field, in the most frightful manner.\\nHis career was short.\\nHe died very soon after I went to Colonel Lloyd\\'s; and he died as he lived, uttering, with his dying groans, bitter curses and horrid oaths.\\nHis death was regarded by the slaves as the result of a merciful providence.\\nMr.\\nSevere\\'s place was filled by a Mr.\\nHopkins.\\nHe was a very different man.\\nHe was less cruel, less profane, and made less noise, than Mr.\\nSevere.\\nHis course was characterized by no extraordinary demonstrations of cruelty.\\nHe whipped, but seemed to take no pleasure in it.\\nHe was called by the slaves a good overseer.\\nThe home plantation of Colonel Lloyd wore the appearance of a country village.\\nAll the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed here.\\nThe shoemaking and mending, the blacksmithing, cartwrighting, coopering, weaving, and grain-grinding, were all performed by the slaves on the home plantation.\\nThe whole place wore a business-like aspect very unlike the neighboring farms.\\nThe number of houses, too, conspired to give it advantage over the neighboring farms.\\nIt was called by the slaves the _Great House Farm._ Few privileges were esteemed higher, by the slaves of the out-farms, than that of being selected to do errands at the Great House Farm.\\nIt was associated in their minds with greatness.\\nA representative could not be prouder of his election to a seat in the American Congress, than a slave on one of the out-farms would be of his election to do errands at the Great House Farm.\\nThey regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them by their overseers; and it was on this account, as well as a constant desire to be out of the field from under the driver\\'s lash, that they esteemed it a high privilege, one worth careful living for.\\nHe was called the smartest and most trusty fellow, who had this honor conferred upon him the most frequently.\\nThe competitors for this office sought as diligently to please their overseers, as the office-seekers in the political parties seek to please and deceive the people.\\nThe same traits of character might be seen in Colonel Lloyd\\'s slaves, as are seen in the slaves of the political parties.\\nThe slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm, for the monthly allowance for themselves and their fellow-slaves, were peculiarly enthusiastic.\\nWhile on their way, they would make the dense old woods, for miles around, reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at once the highest joy and the deepest sadness.\\nThey would compose and sing as they went along, consulting neither time nor tune.\\nThe thought that came up, came out--if not in the word, in the sound;--and as frequently in the one as in the other.\\nThey would sometimes sing the most pathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone, and the most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone.\\nInto all of their songs they would manage to weave something of the Great House Farm.\\nEspecially would they do this, when leaving home.\\nThey would then sing most exultingly the following words:--        \"I am going away to the Great House Farm!\\nO, yea!\\nO, yea!\\nO.\"\\nThis they would sing, as a chorus, to words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to themselves.\\nI have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do.\\nI did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs.\\nI was myself within the circle; so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear.\\nThey told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish.\\nEvery tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains.\\nThe hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness.\\nI have frequently found myself in tears while hearing them.\\nThe mere recurrence to those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek.\\nTo those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery.\\nI can never get rid of that conception.\\nThose songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds.\\nIf any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd\\'s plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him, in silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul,--and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because \"there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.\"\\nI have often been utterly astonished, since I came to the north, to find persons who could speak of the singing, among slaves, as evidence of their contentment and happiness.\\nIt is impossible to conceive of a greater mistake.\\nSlaves sing most when they are most unhappy.\\nThe songs of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart; and he is relieved by them, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears.\\nAt least, such is my experience.\\nI have often sung to drown my sorrow, but seldom to express my happiness.\\nCrying for joy, and singing for joy, were alike uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery.\\nThe singing of a man cast away upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered as evidence of contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave; the songs of the one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion.\\nM\\'Durmond.) This garden was probably the greatest attraction of the place.\\nDuring the summer months, people came from far and near--from Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolis--to see it.\\nIt abounded in fruits of almost every description, from the hardy apple of the north to the delicate orange of the south.\\nThis garden was not the least source of trouble on the plantation.\\nIts excellent fruit was quite a temptation to the hungry swarms of boys, as well as the older slaves, belonging to the colonel, few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it.\\nScarcely a day passed, during the summer, but that some slave had to take the lash for stealing fruit.\\nThe colonel had to resort to all kinds of stratagems to keep his slaves out of the garden.\\nThe last and most successful one was that of tarring his fence all around; after which, if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person, it was deemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden, or had tried to get in.\\nIn either case, he was severely whipped by the chief gardener.\\nThis plan worked well; the slaves became as fearful of tar as of the lash.\\nThey seemed to realize the impossibility of touching _tar_ without being defiled.\\nThe colonel also kept a splendid riding equipage.\\nHis stable and carriage-house presented the appearance of some of our large city livery establishments.\\nHis horses were of the finest form and noblest blood.\\nHis carriage-house contained three splendid coaches, three or four gigs, besides dearborns and barouches of the most fashionable style.\\nThis establishment was under the care of two slaves--old Barney and young Barney--father and son.\\nTo attend to this establishment was their sole work.\\nBut it was by no means an easy employment; for in nothing was Colonel Lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses.\\nThe slightest inattention to these was unpardonable, and was visited upon those, under whose care they were placed, with the severest punishment; no excuse could shield them, if the colonel only suspected any want of attention to his horses--a supposition which he frequently indulged, and one which, of course, made the office of old and young Barney a very trying one.\\nThey never knew when they were safe from punishment.\\nThey were frequently whipped when least deserving, and escaped whipping when most deserving it.\\nEvery thing depended upon the looks of the horses, and the state of Colonel Lloyd\\'s own mind when his horses were brought to him for use.\\nIf a horse did not move fast enough, or hold his head high enough, it was owing to some fault of his keepers.\\nIt was painful to stand near the stable-door, and hear the various complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for use.\\n\"This horse has not had proper attention.\\nHe has not been sufficiently rubbed and curried, or he has not been properly fed; his food was too wet or too dry; he got it too soon or too late; he was too hot or too cold; he had too much hay, and not enough of grain; or he had too much grain, and not enough of hay; instead of old Barney\\'s attending to the horse, he had very improperly left it to his son.\"\\nTo all these complaints, no matter how unjust, the slave must answer never a word.\\nColonel Lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave.\\nWhen he spoke, a slave must stand, listen, and tremble; and such was literally the case.\\nI have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney, a man between fifty and sixty years of age, uncover his bald head, kneel down upon the cold, damp ground, and receive upon his naked and toil-worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time.\\nColonel Lloyd had three sons--Edward, Murray, and Daniel,--and three sons-in-law, Mr.\\nWinder, Mr.\\nNicholson, and Mr.\\nLowndes.\\nAll of these lived at the Great House Farm, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased, from old Barney down to William Wilkes, the coach-driver.\\nI have seen Winder make one of the house-servants stand off from him a suitable distance to be touched with the end of his whip, and at every stroke raise great ridges upon his back.\\nTo describe the wealth of Colonel Lloyd would be almost equal to describing the riches of Job.\\nHe kept from ten to fifteen house-servants.\\nHe was said to own a thousand slaves, and I think this estimate quite within the truth.\\nColonel Lloyd owned so many that he did not know them when he saw them; nor did all the slaves of the out-farms know him.\\nIt is reported of him, that, while riding along the road one day, he met a colored man, and addressed him in the usual manner of speaking to colored people on the public highways of the south: \"Well, boy, whom do you belong to?\"\\n\"To Colonel Lloyd.\"\\nreplied the slave.\\n\"Well, does the colonel treat you well?\"\\n\"No, sir.\"\\nwas the ready reply.\\n\"What, does he work you too hard?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"Well, don\\'t he give you enough to eat?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, he gives me enough, such as it is.\"\\nThe colonel, after ascertaining where the slave belonged, rode on; the man also went on about his business, not dreaming that he had been conversing with his master.\\nHe thought, said, and heard nothing more of the matter, until two or three weeks afterwards.\\nThe poor man was then informed by his overseer that, for having found fault with his master, he was now to be sold to a Georgia trader.\\nHe was immediately chained and handcuffed; and thus, without a moment\\'s warning, he was snatched away, and forever sundered, from his family and friends, by a hand more unrelenting than death.\\nThis is the penalty of telling the truth, of telling the simple truth, in answer to a series of plain questions.\\nIt is partly in consequence of such facts, that slaves, when inquired of as to their condition and the character of their masters, almost universally say they are contented, and that their masters are kind.\\nThe slaveholders have been known to send in spies among their slaves, to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition.\\nThe frequency of this has had the effect to establish among the slaves the maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head.\\nThey suppress the truth rather than take the consequences of telling it, and in so doing prove themselves a part of the human family.\\nIf they have any thing to say of their masters, it is generally in their masters\\' favor, especially when speaking to an untried man.\\nI have been frequently asked, when a slave, if I had a kind master, and do not remember ever to have given a negative answer; nor did I, in pursuing this course, consider myself as uttering what was absolutely false; for I always measured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up among slaveholders around us.\\nMoreover, slaves are like other people, and imbibe prejudices quite common to others.\\nThey think their own better than that of others.\\nMany, under the influence of this prejudice, think their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves; and this, too, in some cases, when the very reverse is true.\\nIndeed, it is not uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative goodness of their masters, each contending for the superior goodness of his own over that of the others.\\nAt the very same time, they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately.\\nIt was so on our plantation.\\nWhen Colonel Lloyd\\'s slaves met the slaves of Jacob Jepson, they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters; Colonel Lloyd\\'s slaves contending that he was the richest, and Mr.\\nJepson\\'s slaves that he was the smartest, and most of a man.\\nColonel Lloyd\\'s slaves would boast his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson.\\nMr.\\nJepson\\'s slaves would boast his ability to whip Colonel Lloyd.\\nThese quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the parties, and those that whipped were supposed to have gained the point at issue.\\nThey seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was transferable to themselves.\\nIt was considered as being bad enough to be a slave; but to be a poor man\\'s slave was deemed a disgrace indeed!\\nHopkins remained but a short time in the office of overseer.\\nWhy his career was so short, I do not know, but suppose he lacked the necessary severity to suit Colonel Lloyd.\\nMr.\\nHopkins was succeeded by Mr.\\nAustin Gore, a man possessing, in an eminent degree, all those traits of character indispensable to what is called a first-rate overseer.\\nMr.\\nGore had served Colonel Lloyd, in the capacity of overseer, upon one of the out-farms, and had shown himself worthy of the high station of overseer upon the home or Great House Farm.\\nMr.\\nGore was proud, ambitious, and persevering.\\nHe was artful, cruel, and obdurate.\\nHe was just the man for such a place, and it was just the place for such a man.\\nIt afforded scope for the full exercise of all his powers, and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it.\\nHe was one of those who could torture the slightest look, word, or gesture, on the part of the slave, into impudence, and would treat it accordingly.\\nThere must be no answering back to him; no explanation was allowed a slave, showing himself to have been wrongfully accused.\\nMr.\\nGore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders,--\"It is better that a dozen slaves should suffer under the lash, than that the overseer should be convicted, in the presence of the slaves, of having been at fault.\"\\nNo matter how innocent a slave might be--it availed him nothing, when accused by Mr.\\nGore of any misdemeanor.\\nTo be accused was to be convicted, and to be convicted was to be punished; the one always following the other with immutable certainty.\\nTo escape punishment was to escape accusation; and few slaves had the fortune to do either, under the overseership of Mr.\\nGore.\\nHe was just proud enough to demand the most debasing homage of the slave, and quite servile enough to crouch, himself, at the feet of the master.\\nHe was ambitious enough to be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers, and persevering enough to reach the height of his ambition.\\nHe was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment, artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience.\\nHe was, of all the overseers, the most dreaded by the slaves.\\nHis presence was painful; his eye flashed confusion; and seldom was his sharp, shrill voice heard, without producing horror and trembling in their ranks.\\nMr.\\nGore was a grave man, and, though a young man, he indulged in no jokes, said no funny words, seldom smiled.\\nHis words were in perfect keeping with his looks, and his looks were in perfect keeping with his words.\\nOverseers will sometimes indulge in a witty word, even with the slaves; not so with Mr.\\nGore.\\nHe spoke but to command, and commanded but to be obeyed; he dealt sparingly with his words, and bountifully with his whip, never using the former where the latter would answer as well.\\nWhen he whipped, he seemed to do so from a sense of duty, and feared no consequences.\\nHe did nothing reluctantly, no matter how disagreeable; always at his post, never inconsistent.\\nHe never promised but to fulfil.\\nHe was, in a word, a man of the most inflexible firmness and stone-like coolness.\\nHis savage barbarity was equalled only by the consummate coolness with which he committed the grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves under his charge.\\nMr.\\nGore once undertook to whip one of Colonel Lloyd\\'s slaves, by the name of Demby.\\nHe had given Demby but few stripes, when, to get rid of the scourging, he ran and plunged himself into a creek, and stood there at the depth of his shoulders, refusing to come out.\\nMr.\\nGore told him that he would give him three calls, and that, if he did not come out at the third call, he would shoot him.\\nThe first call was given.\\nDemby made no response, but stood his ground.\\nThe second and third calls were given with the same result.\\nMr.\\nGore then, without consultation or deliberation with any one, not even giving Demby an additional call, raised his musket to his face, taking deadly aim at his standing victim, and in an instant poor Demby was no more.\\nHis mangled body sank out of sight, and blood and brains marked the water where he had stood.\\nA thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation, excepting Mr.\\nGore.\\nHe alone seemed cool and collected.\\nHe was asked by Colonel Lloyd and my old master, why he resorted to this extraordinary expedient.\\nHis reply was, (as well as I can remember,) that Demby had become unmanageable.\\nHe was setting a dangerous example to the other slaves,--one which, if suffered to pass without some such demonstration on his part, would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and order upon the plantation.\\nHe argued that if one slave refused to be corrected, and escaped with his life, the other slaves would soon copy the example; the result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves, and the enslavement of the whites.\\nMr.\\nGore\\'s defence was satisfactory.\\nHe was continued in his station as overseer upon the home plantation.\\nHis fame as an overseer went abroad.\\nHis horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation.\\nIt was committed in the presence of slaves, and they of course could neither institute a suit, nor testify against him; and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the community in which he lives.\\nMr.\\nGore lived in St.\\nMichael\\'s, Talbot county, Maryland, when I left there; and if he is still alive, he very probably lives there now; and if so, he is now, as he was then, as highly esteemed and as much respected as though his guilty soul had not been stained with his brother\\'s blood.\\nI speak advisedly when I say this,--that killing a slave, or any colored person, in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either by the courts or the community.\\nMr.\\nThomas Lanman, of St.\\nMichael\\'s, killed two slaves, one of whom he killed with a hatchet, by knocking his brains out.\\nHe used to boast of the commission of the awful and bloody deed.\\nI have heard him do so laughingly, saying, among other things, that he was the only benefactor of his country in the company, and that when others would do as much as he had done, we should be relieved of \"the d----d niggers.\"\\nThe wife of Mr.\\nGiles Hicks, living but a short distance from where I used to live, murdered my wife\\'s cousin, a young girl between fifteen and sixteen years of age, mangling her person in the most horrible manner, breaking her nose and breastbone with a stick, so that the poor girl expired in a few hours afterward.\\nShe was immediately buried, but had not been in her untimely grave but a few hours before she was taken up and examined by the coroner, who decided that she had come to her death by severe beating.\\nThe offence for which this girl was thus murdered was this:--She had been set that night to mind Mrs.\\nHicks\\'s baby, and during the night she fell asleep, and the baby cried.\\nShe, having lost her rest for several nights previous, did not hear the crying.\\nThey were both in the room with Mrs.\\nHicks.\\nMrs.\\nHicks, finding the girl slow to move, jumped from her bed, seized an oak stick of wood by the fireplace, and with it broke the girl\\'s nose and breastbone, and thus ended her life.\\nI will not say that this most horrid murder produced no sensation in the community.\\nIt did produce sensation, but not enough to bring the murderess to punishment.\\nThere was a warrant issued for her arrest, but it was never served.\\nThus she escaped not only punishment, but even the pain of being arraigned before a court for her horrid crime.\\nWhilst I am detailing bloody deeds which took place during my stay on Colonel Lloyd\\'s plantation, I will briefly narrate another, which occurred about the same time as the murder of Demby by Mr.\\nGore.\\nColonel Lloyd\\'s slaves were in the habit of spending a part of their nights and Sundays in fishing for oysters, and in this way made up the deficiency of their scanty allowance.\\nAn old man belonging to Colonel Lloyd, while thus engaged, happened to get beyond the limits of Colonel Lloyd\\'s, and on the premises of Mr.\\nBeal Bondly.\\nAt this trespass, Mr.\\nBondly took offence, and with his musket came down to the shore, and blew its deadly contents into the poor old man.\\nMr.\\nBondly came over to see Colonel Lloyd the next day, whether to pay him for his property, or to justify himself in what he had done, I know not.\\nAt any rate, this whole fiendish transaction was soon hushed up.\\nThere was very little said about it at all, and nothing done.\\nIt was a common saying, even among little white boys, that it was worth a half-cent to kill a \"nigger.\"\\nand a half-cent to bury one.\\nI was not old enough to work in the field, and there being little else than field work to do, I had a great deal of leisure time.\\nThe most I had to do was to drive up the cows at evening, keep the fowls out of the garden, keep the front yard clean, and run of errands for my old master\\'s daughter, Mrs.\\nLucretia Auld.\\nThe most of my leisure time I spent in helping Master Daniel Lloyd in finding his birds, after he had shot them.\\nMy connection with Master Daniel was of some advantage to me.\\nHe became quite attached to me, and was a sort of protector of me.\\nHe would not allow the older boys to impose upon me, and would divide his cakes with me.\\nI was seldom whipped by my old master, and suffered little from any thing else than hunger and cold.\\nI suffered much from hunger, but much more from cold.\\nIn hottest summer and coldest winter, I was kept almost naked--no shoes, no stockings, no jacket, no trousers, nothing on but a coarse tow linen shirt, reaching only to my knees.\\nI had no bed.\\nI must have perished with cold, but that, the coldest nights, I used to steal a bag which was used for carrying corn to the mill.\\nI would crawl into this bag, and there sleep on the cold, damp, clay floor, with my head in and feet out.\\nMy feet have been so cracked with the frost, that the pen with which I am writing might be laid in the gashes.\\nWe were not regularly allowanced.\\nOur food was coarse corn meal boiled.\\nThis was called _mush_.\\nIt was put into a large wooden tray or trough, and set down upon the ground.\\nThe children were then called, like so many pigs, and like so many pigs they would come and devour the mush; some with oyster-shells, others with pieces of shingle, some with naked hands, and none with spoons.\\nHe that ate fastest got most; he that was strongest secured the best place; and few left the trough satisfied.\\nI was probably between seven and eight years old when I left Colonel Lloyd\\'s plantation.\\nI left it with joy.\\nI shall never forget the ecstasy with which I received the intelligence that my old master (Anthony) had determined to let me go to Baltimore, to live with Mr.\\nHugh Auld, brother to my old master\\'s son-in-law, Captain Thomas Auld.\\nI received this information about three days before my departure.\\nThey were three of the happiest days I ever enjoyed.\\nI spent the most part of all these three days in the creek, washing off the plantation scurf, and preparing myself for my departure.\\nThe pride of appearance which this would indicate was not my own.\\nI spent the time in washing, not so much because I wished to, but because Mrs.\\nLucretia had told me I must get all the dead skin off my feet and knees before I could go to Baltimore; for the people in Baltimore were very cleanly, and would laugh at me if I looked dirty.\\nBesides, she was going to give me a pair of trousers, which I should not put on unless I got all the dirt off me.\\nThe thought of owning a pair of trousers was great indeed!\\nIt was almost a sufficient motive, not only to make me take off what would be called by pig-drovers the mange, but the skin itself.\\nI went at it in good earnest, working for the first time with the hope of reward.\\nThe ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all suspended in my case.\\nI found no severe trial in my departure.\\nMy home was charmless; it was not home to me; on parting from it, I could not feel that I was leaving any thing which I could have enjoyed by staying.\\nMy mother was dead, my grandmother lived far off, so that I seldom saw her.\\nI had two sisters and one brother, that lived in the same house with me; but the early separation of us from our mother had well nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories.\\nI looked for home elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one which I was leaving.\\nIf, however, I found in my new home hardship, hunger, whipping, and nakedness, I had the consolation that I should not have escaped any one of them by staying.\\nHaving already had more than a taste of them in the house of my old master, and having endured them there, I very naturally inferred my ability to endure them elsewhere, and especially at Baltimore; for I had something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the proverb, that \"being hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural death in Ireland.\"\\nI had the strongest desire to see Baltimore.\\nCousin Tom, though not fluent in speech, had inspired me with that desire by his eloquent description of the place.\\nI could never point out any thing at the Great House, no matter how beautiful or powerful, but that he had seen something at Baltimore far exceeding, both in beauty and strength, the object which I pointed out to him.\\nEven the Great House itself, with all its pictures, was far inferior to many buildings in Baltimore.\\nSo strong was my desire, that I thought a gratification of it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should sustain by the exchange.\\nI left without a regret, and with the highest hopes of future happiness.\\nWe sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning.\\nI remember only the day of the week, for at that time I had no knowledge of the days of the month, nor the months of the year.\\nOn setting sail, I walked aft, and gave to Colonel Lloyd\\'s plantation what I hoped would be the last look.\\nI then placed myself in the bows of the sloop, and there spent the remainder of the day in looking ahead, interesting myself in what was in the distance rather than in things near by or behind.\\nIn the afternoon of that day, we reached Annapolis, the capital of the State.\\nWe stopped but a few moments, so that I had no time to go on shore.\\nIt was the first large town that I had ever seen, and though it would look small compared with some of our New England factory villages, I thought it a wonderful place for its size--more imposing even than the Great House Farm!\\nWe arrived at Baltimore early on Sunday morning, landing at Smith\\'s Wharf, not far from Bowley\\'s Wharf.\\nWe had on board the sloop a large flock of sheep; and after aiding in driving them to the slaughterhouse of Mr.\\nCurtis on Louden Slater\\'s Hill, I was conducted by Rich, one of the hands belonging on board of the sloop, to my new home in Alliciana Street, near Mr.\\nGardner\\'s ship-yard, on Fells Point.\\nMr.\\nand Mrs.\\nAuld were both at home, and met me at the door with their little son Thomas, to take care of whom I had been given.\\nAnd here I saw what I had never seen before; it was a white face beaming with the most kindly emotions; it was the face of my new mistress, Sophia Auld.\\nI wish I could describe the rapture that flashed through my soul as I beheld it.\\nIt was a new and strange sight to me, brightening up my pathway with the light of happiness.\\nLittle Thomas was told, there was his Freddy,--and I was told to take care of little Thomas; and thus I entered upon the duties of my new home with the most cheering prospect ahead.\\nI look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd\\'s plantation as one of the most interesting events of my life.\\nIt is possible, and even quite probable, that but for the mere circumstance of being removed from that plantation to Baltimore, I should have to-day, instead of being here seated by my own table, in the enjoyment of freedom and the happiness of home, writing this Narrative, been confined in the galling chains of slavery.\\nGoing to live at Baltimore laid the foundation, and opened the gateway, to all my subsequent prosperity.\\nI have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has ever since attended me, and marked my life with so many favors.\\nI regarded the selection of myself as being somewhat remarkable.\\nThere were a number of slave children that might have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore.\\nThere were those younger, those older, and those of the same age.\\nI was chosen from among them all, and was the first, last, and only choice.\\nI may be deemed superstitious, and even egotistical, in regarding this event as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor.\\nBut I should be false to the earliest sentiments of my soul, if I suppressed the opinion.\\nI prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and incur my own abhorrence.\\nFrom my earliest recollection, I date the entertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace; and in the darkest hours of my career in slavery, this living word of faith and spirit of hope departed not from me, but remained like ministering angels to cheer me through the gloom.\\nThis good spirit was from God, and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise.\\nShe had never had a slave under her control previously to myself, and prior to her marriage she had been dependent upon her own industry for a living.\\nShe was by trade a weaver; and by constant application to her business, she had been in a good degree preserved from the blighting and dehumanizing effects of slavery.\\nI was utterly astonished at her goodness.\\nI scarcely knew how to behave towards her.\\nShe was entirely unlike any other white woman I had ever seen.\\nI could not approach her as I was accustomed to approach other white ladies.\\nMy early instruction was all out of place.\\nThe crouching servility, usually so acceptable a quality in a slave, did not answer when manifested toward her.\\nHer favor was not gained by it; she seemed to be disturbed by it.\\nShe did not deem it impudent or unmannerly for a slave to look her in the face.\\nThe meanest slave was put fully at ease in her presence, and none left without feeling better for having seen her.\\nHer face was made of heavenly smiles, and her voice of tranquil music.\\nBut, alas!\\nthis kind heart had but a short time to remain such.\\nThe fatal poison of irresponsible power was already in her hands, and soon commenced its infernal work.\\nThat cheerful eye, under the influence of slavery, soon became red with rage; that voice, made all of sweet accord, changed to one of harsh and horrid discord; and that angelic face gave place to that of a demon.\\nVery soon after I went to live with Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nAuld, she very kindly commenced to teach me the A, B, C.\\nAfter I had learned this, she assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters.\\nJust at this point of my progress, Mr.\\nAuld found out what was going on, and at once forbade Mrs.\\nAuld to instruct me further, telling her, among other things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a slave to read.\\nTo use his own words, further, he said, \"If you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell.\\nA nigger should know nothing but to obey his master--to do as he is told to do.\\nLearning would _spoil_ the best nigger in the world.\\nNow.\"\\nsaid he, \"if you teach that nigger (speaking of myself) how to read, there would be no keeping him.\\nIt would forever unfit him to be a slave.\\nHe would at once become unmanageable, and of no value to his master.\\nAs to himself, it could do him no good, but a great deal of harm.\\nIt would make him discontented and unhappy.\"\\nThese words sank deep into my heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering, and called into existence an entirely new train of thought.\\nIt was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things, with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in vain.\\nI now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty--to wit, the white man\\'s power to enslave the black man.\\nIt was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly.\\nFrom that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom.\\nIt was just what I wanted, and I got it at a time when I the least expected it.\\nWhilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind mistress, I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which, by the merest accident, I had gained from my master.\\nThough conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read.\\nThe very decided manner with which he spoke, and strove to impress his wife with the evil consequences of giving me instruction, served to convince me that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering.\\nIt gave me the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which, he said, would flow from teaching me to read.\\nWhat he most dreaded, that I most desired.\\nWhat he most loved, that I most hated.\\nThat which to him was a great evil, to be carefully shunned, was to me a great good, to be diligently sought; and the argument which he so warmly urged, against my learning to read, only served to inspire me with a desire and determination to learn.\\nIn learning to read, I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly aid of my mistress.\\nI acknowledge the benefit of both.\\nI had resided but a short time in Baltimore before I observed a marked difference, in the treatment of slaves, from that which I had witnessed in the country.\\nA city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave on the plantation.\\nHe is much better fed and clothed, and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation.\\nThere is a vestige of decency, a sense of shame, that does much to curb and check those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the plantation.\\nHe is a desperate slaveholder, who will shock the humanity of his non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated slave.\\nFew are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputation of being a cruel master; and above all things, they would not be known as not giving a slave enough to eat.\\nEvery city slaveholder is anxious to have it known of him, that he feeds his slaves well; and it is due to them to say, that most of them do give their slaves enough to eat.\\nThere are, however, some painful exceptions to this rule.\\nDirectly opposite to us, on Philpot Street, lived Mr.\\nThomas Hamilton.\\nHe owned two slaves.\\nTheir names were Henrietta and Mary.\\nHenrietta was about twenty-two years of age, Mary was about fourteen; and of all the mangled and emaciated creatures I ever looked upon, these two were the most so.\\nHis heart must be harder than stone, that could look upon these unmoved.\\nThe head, neck, and shoulders of Mary were literally cut to pieces.\\nI have frequently felt her head, and found it nearly covered with festering sores, caused by the lash of her cruel mistress.\\nI do not know that her master ever whipped her, but I have been an eye-witness to the cruelty of Mrs.\\nHamilton.\\nI used to be in Mr.\\nHamilton\\'s house nearly every day.\\nMrs.\\nHamilton used to sit in a large chair in the middle of the room, with a heavy cowskin always by her side, and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the blood of one of these slaves.\\nThe girls seldom passed her without her saying, \"Move faster, you _black gip!.\"\\nat the same time giving them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders, often drawing the blood.\\nShe would then say, \"Take that, you _black gip!.\"\\ncontinuing, \"If you don\\'t move faster, I\\'ll move you.\"\\nAdded to the cruel lashings to which these slaves were subjected, they were kept nearly half-starved.\\nThey seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal.\\nI have seen Mary contending with the pigs for the offal thrown into the street.\\nSo much was Mary kicked and cut to pieces, that she was oftener called \"_pecked.\"\\nthan by her name.\\nDuring this time, I succeeded in learning to read and write.\\nIn accomplishing this, I was compelled to resort to various stratagems.\\nI had no regular teacher.\\nMy mistress, who had kindly commenced to instruct me, had, in compliance with the advice and direction of her husband, not only ceased to instruct, but had set her face against my being instructed by any one else.\\nIt is due, however, to my mistress to say of her, that she did not adopt this course of treatment immediately.\\nShe at first lacked the depravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness.\\nIt was at least necessary for her to have some training in the exercise of irresponsible power, to make her equal to the task of treating me as though I were a brute.\\nMy mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another.\\nIn entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so.\\nSlavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me.\\nWhen I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman.\\nThere was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear.\\nShe had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach.\\nSlavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities.\\nUnder its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness.\\nThe first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me.\\nShe now commenced to practise her husband\\'s precepts.\\nShe finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself.\\nShe was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he had commanded; she seemed anxious to do better.\\nNothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper.\\nShe seemed to think that here lay the danger.\\nI have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury, and snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension.\\nShe was an apt woman; and a little experience soon demonstrated, to her satisfaction, that education and slavery were incompatible with each other.\\nFrom this time I was most narrowly watched.\\nIf I was in a separate room any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a book, and was at once called to give an account of myself.\\nAll this, however, was too late.\\nThe first step had been taken.\\nMistress, in teaching me the alphabet, had given me the _inch,_ and no precaution could prevent me from taking the _ell._  The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street.\\nAs many of these as I could, I converted into teachers.\\nWith their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read.\\nWhen I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return.\\nI used also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood.\\nThis bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge.\\nI am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;--not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country.\\nIt is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey\\'s ship-yard.\\nI used to talk this matter of slavery over with them.\\nI would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men.\\n\"You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, _but I am a slave for life!_ Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?\"\\nThese words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free.\\nI was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being _a slave for life_ began to bear heavily upon my heart.\\nJust about this time, I got hold of a book entitled \"The Columbian Orator.\"\\nEvery opportunity I got, I used to read this book.\\nAmong much of other interesting matter, I found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave.\\nThe slave was represented as having run away from his master three times.\\nThe dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them, when the slave was retaken the third time.\\nIn this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the slave.\\nThe slave was made to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master--things which had the desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master.\\nIn the same book, I met with one of Sheridan\\'s mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic emancipation.\\nThese were choice documents to me.\\nI read them over and over again with unabated interest.\\nThey gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently flashed through my mind, and died away for want of utterance.\\nThe moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder.\\nWhat I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery, and a powerful vindication of human rights.\\nThe reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery; but while they relieved me of one difficulty, they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I was relieved.\\nThe more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers.\\nI could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers, who had left their homes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land reduced us to slavery.\\nI loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men.\\nAs I read and contemplated the subject, behold!\\nthat very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come, to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish.\\nAs I writhed under it, I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing.\\nIt had given me a view of my wretched condition, without the remedy.\\nIt opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get out.\\nIn moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity.\\nI have often wished myself a beast.\\nI preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own.\\nAny thing, no matter what, to get rid of thinking!\\nIt was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me.\\nThere was no getting rid of it.\\nIt was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or inanimate.\\nThe silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness.\\nFreedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever.\\nIt was heard in every sound, and seen in every thing.\\nIt was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition.\\nI saw nothing without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and felt nothing without feeling it.\\nIt looked from every star, it smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every storm.\\nI often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself dead; and but for the hope of being free, I have no doubt but that I should have killed myself, or done something for which I should have been killed.\\nWhile in this state of mind, I was eager to hear any one speak of slavery.\\nI was a ready listener.\\nEvery little while, I could hear something about the abolitionists.\\nIt was some time before I found what the word meant.\\nIt was always used in such connections as to make it an interesting word to me.\\nIf a slave ran away and succeeded in getting clear, or if a slave killed his master, set fire to a barn, or did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder, it was spoken of as the fruit of _abolition._ Hearing the word in this connection very often, I set about learning what it meant.\\nThe dictionary afforded me little or no help.\\nI found it was \"the act of abolishing.\"\\nbut then I did not know what was to be abolished.\\nHere I was perplexed.\\nI did not dare to ask any one about its meaning, for I was satisfied that it was something they wanted me to know very little about.\\nAfter a patient waiting, I got one of our city papers, containing an account of the number of petitions from the north, praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and of the slave trade between the States.\\nFrom this time I understood the words _abolition_ and _abolitionist,_ and always drew near when that word was spoken, expecting to hear something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves.\\nThe light broke in upon me by degrees.\\nI went one day down on the wharf of Mr.\\nWaters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone, I went, unasked, and helped them.\\nWhen we had finished, one of them came to me and asked me if I were a slave.\\nI told him I was.\\nHe asked, \"Are ye a slave for life?\"\\nI told him that I was.\\nThe good Irishman seemed to be deeply affected by the statement.\\nHe said to the other that it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for life.\\nHe said it was a shame to hold me.\\nThey both advised me to run away to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I should be free.\\nI pretended not to be interested in what they said, and treated them as if I did not understand them; for I feared they might be treacherous.\\nWhite men have been known to encourage slaves to escape, and then, to get the reward, catch them and return them to their masters.\\nI was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me so; but I nevertheless remembered their advice, and from that time I resolved to run away.\\nI looked forward to a time at which it would be safe for me to escape.\\nI was too young to think of doing so immediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, as I might have occasion to write my own pass.\\nI consoled myself with the hope that I should one day find a good chance.\\nMeanwhile, I would learn to write.\\nThe idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by being in Durgin and Bailey\\'s ship-yard, and frequently seeing the ship carpenters, after hewing, and getting a piece of timber ready for use, write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was intended.\\nWhen a piece of timber was intended for the larboard side, it would be marked thus--\"L.\"\\nWhen a piece was for the starboard side, it would be marked thus--\"S.\"\\nA piece for the larboard side forward, would be marked thus--\"L.\\nF.\"\\nWhen a piece was for starboard side forward, it would be marked thus--\"S.\\nF.\"\\nFor larboard aft, it would be marked thus--\"L.\\nA.\"\\nFor starboard aft, it would be marked thus--\"S.\\nA.\"\\nI soon learned the names of these letters, and for what they were intended when placed upon a piece of timber in the ship-yard.\\nI immediately commenced copying them, and in a short time was able to make the four letters named.\\nAfter that, when I met with any boy who I knew could write, I would tell him I could write as well as he.\\nThe next word would be, \"I don\\'t believe you.\\nLet me see you try it.\"\\nI would then make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn, and ask him to beat that.\\nIn this way I got a good many lessons in writing, which it is quite possible I should never have gotten in any other way.\\nDuring this time, my copy-book was the board fence, brick wall, and pavement; my pen and ink was a lump of chalk.\\nWith these, I learned mainly how to write.\\nI then commenced and continued copying the Italics in Webster\\'s Spelling Book, until I could make them all without looking on the book.\\nBy this time, my little Master Thomas had gone to school, and learned how to write, and had written over a number of copy-books.\\nThese had been brought home, and shown to some of our near neighbors, and then laid aside.\\nMy mistress used to go to class meeting at the Wilk Street meetinghouse every Monday afternoon, and leave me to take care of the house.\\nWhen left thus, I used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left in Master Thomas\\'s copy-book, copying what he had written.\\nI continued to do this until I could write a hand very similar to that of Master Thomas.\\nThus, after a long, tedious effort for years, I finally succeeded in learning how to write.\\nHe died while on a visit to see his daughter at Hillsborough.\\nCut off thus unexpectedly, he left no will as to the disposal of his property.\\nIt was therefore necessary to have a valuation of the property, that it might be equally divided between Mrs.\\nLucretia and Master Andrew.\\nI was immediately sent for, to be valued with the other property.\\nHere again my feelings rose up in detestation of slavery.\\nI had now a new conception of my degraded condition.\\nPrior to this, I had become, if not insensible to my lot, at least partly so.\\nI left Baltimore with a young heart overborne with sadness, and a soul full of apprehension.\\nI took passage with Captain Rowe, in the schooner Wild Cat, and, after a sail of about twenty-four hours, I found myself near the place of my birth.\\nI had now been absent from it almost, if not quite, five years.\\nI, however, remembered the place very well.\\nI was only about five years old when I left it, to go and live with my old master on Colonel Lloyd\\'s plantation; so that I was now between ten and eleven years old.\\nWe were all ranked together at the valuation.\\nMen and women, old and young, married and single, were ranked with horses, sheep, and swine.\\nThere were horses and men, cattle and women, pigs and children, all holding the same rank in the scale of being, and were all subjected to the same narrow examination.\\nSilvery-headed age and sprightly youth, maids and matrons, had to undergo the same indelicate inspection.\\nAt this moment, I saw more clearly than ever the brutalizing effects of slavery upon both slave and slaveholder.\\nAfter the valuation, then came the division.\\nI have no language to express the high excitement and deep anxiety which were felt among us poor slaves during this time.\\nOur fate for life was now to be decided.\\nwe had no more voice in that decision than the brutes among whom we were ranked.\\nA single word from the white men was enough--against all our wishes, prayers, and entreaties--to sunder forever the dearest friends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties known to human beings.\\nIn addition to the pain of separation, there was the horrid dread of falling into the hands of Master Andrew.\\nHe was known to us all as being a most cruel wretch,--a common drunkard, who had, by his reckless mismanagement and profligate dissipation, already wasted a large portion of his father\\'s property.\\nWe all felt that we might as well be sold at once to the Georgia traders, as to pass into his hands; for we knew that that would be our inevitable condition,--a condition held by us all in the utmost horror and dread.\\nI suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-slaves.\\nI had known what it was to be kindly treated; they had known nothing of the kind.\\nThey had seen little or nothing of the world.\\nThey were in very deed men and women of sorrow, and acquainted with grief.\\nTheir backs had been made familiar with the bloody lash, so that they had become callous; mine was yet tender; for while at Baltimore I got few whippings, and few slaves could boast of a kinder master and mistress than myself; and the thought of passing out of their hands into those of Master Andrew--a man who, but a few days before, to give me a sample of his bloody disposition, took my little brother by the throat, threw him on the ground, and with the heel of his boot stamped upon his head till the blood gushed from his nose and ears--was well calculated to make me anxious as to my fate.\\nAfter he had committed this savage outrage upon my brother, he turned to me, and said that was the way he meant to serve me one of these days,--meaning, I suppose, when I came into his possession.\\nThanks to a kind Providence, I fell to the portion of Mrs.\\nLucretia, and was sent immediately back to Baltimore, to live again in the family of Master Hugh.\\nTheir joy at my return equalled their sorrow at my departure.\\nIt was a glad day to me.\\nI had escaped a worse than lion\\'s jaws.\\nI was absent from Baltimore, for the purpose of valuation and division, just about one month, and it seemed to have been six.\\nVery soon after my return to Baltimore, my mistress, Lucretia, died, leaving her husband and one child, Amanda; and in a very short time after her death, Master Andrew died.\\nNow all the property of my old master, slaves included, was in the hands of strangers,--strangers who had had nothing to do with accumulating it.\\nNot a slave was left free.\\nAll remained slaves, from the youngest to the oldest.\\nIf any one thing in my experience, more than another, served to deepen my conviction of the infernal character of slavery, and to fill me with unutterable loathing of slaveholders, it was their base ingratitude to my poor old grandmother.\\nShe had served my old master faithfully from youth to old age.\\nShe had been the source of all his wealth; she had peopled his plantation with slaves; she had become a great grandmother in his service.\\nShe had rocked him in infancy, attended him in childhood, served him through life, and at his death wiped from his icy brow the cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever.\\nShe was nevertheless left a slave--a slave for life--a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their hands she saw her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, divided, like so many sheep, without being gratified with the small privilege of a single word, as to their or her own destiny.\\nAnd, to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having outlived my old master and all his children, having seen the beginning and end of all of them, and her present owners finding she was of but little value, her frame already racked with the pains of old age, and complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs, they took her to the woods, built her a little hut, put up a little mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to die!\\nIf my poor old grandmother now lives, she lives to suffer in utter loneliness; she lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children, the loss of grandchildren, and the loss of great-grandchildren.\\nThey are, in the language of the slave\\'s poet, Whittier,--        \"Gone, gone, sold and gone      To the rice swamp dank and lone,      Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,      Where the noisome insect stings,      Where the fever-demon strews      Poison with the falling dews,      Where the sickly sunbeams glare      Through the hot and misty air:&mdash;      Gone, gone, sold and gone      To the rice swamp dank and lone,      From Virginia hills and waters&mdash;      Woe is me, my stolen daughters.\"\\nThe hearth is desolate.\\nThe children, the unconscious children, who once sang and danced in her presence, are gone.\\nShe gropes her way, in the darkness of age, for a drink of water.\\nInstead of the voices of her children, she hears by day the moans of the dove, and by night the screams of the hideous owl.\\nAll is gloom.\\nThe grave is at the door.\\nAnd now, when weighed down by the pains and aches of old age, when the head inclines to the feet, when the beginning and ending of human existence meet, and helpless infancy and painful old age combine together--at this time, this most needful time, the time for the exercise of that tenderness and affection which children only can exercise towards a declining parent--my poor old grandmother, the devoted mother of twelve children, is left all alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim embers.\\nShe stands--she sits--she staggers--she falls--she groans--she dies--and there are none of her children or grandchildren present, to wipe from her wrinkled brow the cold sweat of death, or to place beneath the sod her fallen remains.\\nWill not a righteous God visit for these things?\\nIn about two years after the death of Mrs.\\nLucretia, Master Thomas married his second wife.\\nHer name was Rowena Hamilton.\\nShe was the eldest daughter of Mr.\\nWilliam Hamilton.\\nMaster now lived in St.\\nMichael\\'s.\\nNot long after his marriage, a misunderstanding took place between himself and Master Hugh; and as a means of punishing his brother, he took me from him to live with himself at St.\\nMichael\\'s.\\nHere I underwent another most painful separation.\\nIt, however, was not so severe as the one I dreaded at the division of property; for, during this interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his once kind and affectionate wife.\\nThe influence of brandy upon him, and of slavery upon her, had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both; so that, as far as they were concerned, I thought I had little to lose by the change.\\nBut it was not to them that I was attached.\\nIt was to those little Baltimore boys that I felt the strongest attachment.\\nI had received many good lessons from them, and was still receiving them, and the thought of leaving them was painful indeed.\\nI was leaving, too, without the hope of ever being allowed to return.\\nMaster Thomas had said he would never let me return again.\\nThe barrier betwixt himself and brother he considered impassable.\\nI then had to regret that I did not at least make the attempt to carry out my resolution to run away; for the chances of success are tenfold greater from the city than from the country.\\nI sailed from Baltimore for St.\\nMichael\\'s in the sloop Amanda, Captain Edward Dodson.\\nOn my passage, I paid particular attention to the direction which the steamboats took to go to Philadelphia.\\nI found, instead of going down, on reaching North Point they went up the bay, in a north-easterly direction.\\nI deemed this knowledge of the utmost importance.\\nMy determination to run away was again revived.\\nI resolved to wait only so long as the offering of a favorable opportunity.\\nWhen that came, I was determined to be off.\\nI left Baltimore, and went to live with Master Thomas Auld, at St.\\nMichael\\'s, in March, 1832.\\nIt was now more than seven years since I lived with him in the family of my old master, on Colonel Lloyd\\'s plantation.\\nWe of course were now almost entire strangers to each other.\\nHe was to me a new master, and I to him a new slave.\\nI was ignorant of his temper and disposition; he was equally so of mine.\\nA very short time, however, brought us into full acquaintance with each other.\\nI was made acquainted with his wife not less than with himself.\\nThey were well matched, being equally mean and cruel.\\nI was now, for the first time during a space of more than seven years, made to feel the painful gnawings of hunger--a something which I had not experienced before since I left Colonel Lloyd\\'s plantation.\\nIt went hard enough with me then, when I could look back to no period at which I had enjoyed a sufficiency.\\nIt was tenfold harder after living in Master Hugh\\'s family, where I had always had enough to eat, and of that which was good.\\nI have said Master Thomas was a mean man.\\nHe was so.\\nNot to give a slave enough to eat, is regarded as the most aggravated development of meanness even among slaveholders.\\nThe rule is, no matter how coarse the food, only let there be enough of it.\\nThis is the theory; and in the part of Maryland from which I came, it is the general practice,--though there are many exceptions.\\nMaster Thomas gave us enough of neither coarse nor fine food.\\nThere were four slaves of us in the kitchen--my sister Eliza, my aunt Priscilla, Henny, and myself; and we were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal per week, and very little else, either in the shape of meat or vegetables.\\nIt was not enough for us to subsist upon.\\nWe were therefore reduced to the wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors.\\nThis we did by begging and stealing, whichever came handy in the time of need, the one being considered as legitimate as the other.\\nA great many times have we poor creatures been nearly perishing with hunger, when food in abundance lay mouldering in the safe and smoke-house, and our pious mistress was aware of the fact; and yet that mistress and her husband would kneel every morning, and pray that God would bless them in basket and store!\\nBad as all slaveholders are, we seldom meet one destitute of every element of character commanding respect.\\nMy master was one of this rare sort.\\nI do not know of one single noble act ever performed by him.\\nThe leading trait in his character was meanness; and if there were any other element in his nature, it was made subject to this.\\nHe was mean; and, like most other mean men, he lacked the ability to conceal his meanness.\\nCaptain Auld was not born a slaveholder.\\nHe had been a poor man, master only of a Bay craft.\\nHe came into possession of all his slaves by marriage; and of all men, adopted slaveholders are the worst.\\nHe was cruel, but cowardly.\\nHe commanded without firmness.\\nIn the enforcement of his rules, he was at times rigid, and at times lax.\\nAt times, he spoke to his slaves with the firmness of Napoleon and the fury of a demon; at other times, he might well be mistaken for an inquirer who had lost his way.\\nHe did nothing of himself.\\nHe might have passed for a lion, but for his ears.\\nIn all things noble which he attempted, his own meanness shone most conspicuous.\\nHis airs, words, and actions, were the airs, words, and actions of born slaveholders, and, being assumed, were awkward enough.\\nHe was not even a good imitator.\\nHe possessed all the disposition to deceive, but wanted the power.\\nHaving no resources within himself, he was compelled to be the copyist of many, and being such, he was forever the victim of inconsistency; and of consequence he was an object of contempt, and was held as such even by his slaves.\\nThe luxury of having slaves of his own to wait upon him was something new and unprepared for.\\nHe was a slaveholder without the ability to hold slaves.\\nHe found himself incapable of managing his slaves either by force, fear, or fraud.\\nWe seldom called him \"master.\"\\nwe generally called him \"Captain Auld.\"\\nand were hardly disposed to title him at all.\\nI doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making him appear awkward, and of consequence fretful.\\nOur want of reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly.\\nHe wished to have us call him master, but lacked the firmness necessary to command us to do so.\\nHis wife used to insist upon our calling him so, but to no purpose.\\nIn August, 1832, my master attended a Methodist camp-meeting held in the Bay-side, Talbot county, and there experienced religion.\\nI indulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead him to emancipate his slaves, and that, if he did not do this, it would, at any rate, make him more kind and humane.\\nI was disappointed in both these respects.\\nIt neither made him to be humane to his slaves, nor to emancipate them.\\nIf it had any effect on his character, it made him more cruel and hateful in all his ways; for I believe him to have been a much worse man after his conversion than before.\\nPrior to his conversion, he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him in his savage barbarity; but after his conversion, he found religious sanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty.\\nHe made the greatest pretensions to piety.\\nHis house was the house of prayer.\\nHe prayed morning, noon, and night.\\nHe very soon distinguished himself among his brethren, and was soon made a class-leader and exhorter.\\nHis activity in revivals was great, and he proved himself an instrument in the hands of the church in converting many souls.\\nHis house was the preachers\\' home.\\nThey used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up; for while he starved us, he stuffed them.\\nWe have had three or four preachers there at a time.\\nThe names of those who used to come most frequently while I lived there, were Mr.\\nStorks, Mr.\\nEwery, Mr.\\nHumphry, and Mr.\\nHickey.\\nI have also seen Mr.\\nGeorge Cookman at our house.\\nWe slaves loved Mr.\\nCookman.\\nWe believed him to be a good man.\\nWe thought him instrumental in getting Mr.\\nSamuel Harrison, a very rich slaveholder, to emancipate his slaves; and by some means got the impression that he was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the slaves.\\nWhen he was at our house, we were sure to be called in to prayers.\\nWhen the others were there, we were sometimes called in and sometimes not.\\nMr.\\nCookman took more notice of us than either of the other ministers.\\nHe could not come among us without betraying his sympathy for us, and, stupid as we were, we had the sagacity to see it.\\nWhile I lived with my master in St.\\nMichael\\'s, there was a white young man, a Mr.\\nWilson, who proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the instruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the New Testament.\\nWe met but three times, when Mr.\\nWest and Mr.\\nFairbanks, both class-leaders, with many others, came upon us with sticks and other missiles, drove us off, and forbade us to meet again.\\nThus ended our little Sabbath school in the pious town of St.\\nMichael\\'s.\\nI have said my master found religious sanction for his cruelty.\\nAs an example, I will state one of many facts going to prove the charge.\\nI have seen him tie up a lame young woman, and whip her with a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders, causing the warm red blood to drip; and, in justification of the bloody deed, he would quote this passage of Scripture--\"He that knoweth his master\\'s will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.\"\\nMaster would keep this lacerated young woman tied up in this horrid situation four or five hours at a time.\\nI have known him to tie her up early in the morning, and whip her before breakfast; leave her, go to his store, return at dinner, and whip her again, cutting her in the places already made raw with his cruel lash.\\nThe secret of master\\'s cruelty toward \"Henn.\"\\nis found in the fact of her being almost helpless.\\nWhen quite a child, she fell into the fire, and burned herself horribly.\\nHer hands were so burnt that she never got the use of them.\\nShe could do very little but bear heavy burdens.\\nShe was to master a bill of expense; and as he was a mean man, she was a constant offence to him.\\nHe seemed desirous of getting the poor girl out of existence.\\nHe gave her away once to his sister; but, being a poor gift, she was not disposed to keep her.\\nFinally, my benevolent master, to use his own words, \"set her adrift to take care of herself.\"\\nHere was a recently-converted man, holding on upon the mother, and at the same time turning out her helpless child, to starve and die!\\nMaster Thomas was one of the many pious slaveholders who hold slaves for the very charitable purpose of taking care of them.\\nMy master and myself had quite a number of differences.\\nHe found me unsuitable to his purpose.\\nMy city life, he said, had had a very pernicious effect upon me.\\nIt had almost ruined me for every good purpose, and fitted me for every thing which was bad.\\nOne of my greatest faults was that of letting his horse run away, and go down to his father-inlaw\\'s farm, which was about five miles from St.\\nMichael\\'s.\\nI would then have to go after it.\\nMy reason for this kind of carelessness, or carefulness, was, that I could always get something to eat when I went there.\\nMaster William Hamilton, my master\\'s father-in-law, always gave his slaves enough to eat.\\nI never left there hungry, no matter how great the need of my speedy return.\\nMaster Thomas at length said he would stand it no longer.\\nI had lived with him nine months, during which time he had given me a number of severe whippings, all to no good purpose.\\nHe resolved to put me out, as he said, to be broken; and, for this purpose, he let me for one year to a man named Edward Covey.\\nMr.\\nCovey was a poor man, a farm-renter.\\nHe rented the place upon which he lived, as also the hands with which he tilled it.\\nMr.\\nCovey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young slaves, and this reputation was of immense value to him.\\nIt enabled him to get his farm tilled with much less expense to himself than he could have had it done without such a reputation.\\nSome slaveholders thought it not much loss to allow Mr.\\nCovey to have their slaves one year, for the sake of the training to which they were subjected, without any other compensation.\\nHe could hire young help with great ease, in consequence of this reputation.\\nAdded to the natural good qualities of Mr.\\nCovey, he was a professor of religion--a pious soul--a member and a class-leader in the Methodist church.\\nAll of this added weight to his reputation as a \"nigger-breaker.\"\\nI was aware of all the facts, having been made acquainted with them by a young man who had lived there.\\nI nevertheless made the change gladly; for I was sure of getting enough to eat, which is not the smallest consideration to a hungry man.\\nCovey, on the 1st of January, 1833.\\nI was now, for the first time in my life, a field hand.\\nIn my new employment, I found myself even more awkward than a country boy appeared to be in a large city.\\nI had been at my new home but one week before Mr.\\nCovey gave me a very severe whipping, cutting my back, causing the blood to run, and raising ridges on my flesh as large as my little finger.\\nThe details of this affair are as follows: Mr.\\nCovey sent me, very early in the morning of one of our coldest days in the month of January, to the woods, to get a load of wood.\\nHe gave me a team of unbroken oxen.\\nHe told me which was the in-hand ox, and which the off-hand one.\\nHe then tied the end of a large rope around the horns of the in-hand ox, and gave me the other end of it, and told me, if the oxen started to run, that I must hold on upon the rope.\\nI had never driven oxen before, and of course I was very awkward.\\nI, however, succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty; but I had got a very few rods into the woods, when the oxen took fright, and started full tilt, carrying the cart against trees, and over stumps, in the most frightful manner.\\nI expected every moment that my brains would be dashed out against the trees.\\nAfter running thus for a considerable distance, they finally upset the cart, dashing it with great force against a tree, and threw themselves into a dense thicket.\\nHow I escaped death, I do not know.\\nThere I was, entirely alone, in a thick wood, in a place new to me.\\nMy cart was upset and shattered, my oxen were entangled among the young trees, and there was none to help me.\\nAfter a long spell of effort, I succeeded in getting my cart righted, my oxen disentangled, and again yoked to the cart.\\nI now proceeded with my team to the place where I had, the day before, been chopping wood, and loaded my cart pretty heavily, thinking in this way to tame my oxen.\\nI then proceeded on my way home.\\nI had now consumed one half of the day.\\nI got out of the woods safely, and now felt out of danger.\\nI stopped my oxen to open the woods gate; and just as I did so, before I could get hold of my ox-rope, the oxen again started, rushed through the gate, catching it between the wheel and the body of the cart, tearing it to pieces, and coming within a few inches of crushing me against the gate-post.\\nThus twice, in one short day, I escaped death by the merest chance.\\nOn my return, I told Mr.\\nCovey what had happened, and how it happened.\\nHe ordered me to return to the woods again immediately.\\nI did so, and he followed on after me.\\nJust as I got into the woods, he came up and told me to stop my cart, and that he would teach me how to trifle away my time, and break gates.\\nHe then went to a large gum-tree, and with his axe cut three large switches, and, after trimming them up neatly with his pocketknife, he ordered me to take off my clothes.\\nI made him no answer, but stood with my clothes on.\\nHe repeated his order.\\nI still made him no answer, nor did I move to strip myself.\\nUpon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore off my clothes, and lashed me till he had worn out his switches, cutting me so savagely as to leave the marks visible for a long time after.\\nThis whipping was the first of a number just like it, and for similar offences.\\nI lived with Mr.\\nCovey one year.\\nDuring the first six months, of that year, scarce a week passed without his whipping me.\\nI was seldom free from a sore back.\\nMy awkwardness was almost always his excuse for whipping me.\\nWe were worked fully up to the point of endurance.\\nLong before day we were up, our horses fed, and by the first approach of day we were off to the field with our hoes and ploughing teams.\\nMr.\\nCovey gave us enough to eat, but scarce time to eat it.\\nWe were often less than five minutes taking our meals.\\nWe were often in the field from the first approach of day till its last lingering ray had left us; and at saving-fodder time, midnight often caught us in the field binding blades.\\nCovey would be out with us.\\nThe way he used to stand it, was this.\\nHe would spend the most of his afternoons in bed.\\nHe would then come out fresh in the evening, ready to urge us on with his words, example, and frequently with the whip.\\nMr.\\nCovey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with his hands.\\nHe was a hard-working man.\\nHe knew by himself just what a man or a boy could do.\\nThere was no deceiving him.\\nHis work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence; and he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with us.\\nThis he did by surprising us.\\nHe seldom approached the spot where we were at work openly, if he could do it secretly.\\nHe always aimed at taking us by surprise.\\nSuch was his cunning, that we used to call him, among ourselves, \"the snake.\"\\nWhen we were at work in the cornfield, he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection, and all at once he would rise nearly in our midst, and scream out, \"Ha, ha!\\nCome, come!\\nDash on, dash on.\"\\nThis being his mode of attack, it was never safe to stop a single minute.\\nHis comings were like a thief in the night.\\nHe appeared to us as being ever at hand.\\nHe was under every tree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every window, on the plantation.\\nHe would sometimes mount his horse, as if bound to St.\\nMichael\\'s, a distance of seven miles, and in half an hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence, watching every motion of the slaves.\\nHe would, for this purpose, leave his horse tied up in the woods.\\nAgain, he would sometimes walk up to us, and give us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long journey, turn his back upon us, and make as though he was going to the house to get ready; and, before he would get half way thither, he would turn short and crawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and there watch us till the going down of the sun.\\nMr.\\nCovey\\'s _forte_ consisted in his power to deceive.\\nHis life was devoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions.\\nEvery thing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion, he made conform to his disposition to deceive.\\nHe seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the Almighty.\\nHe would make a short prayer in the morning, and a long prayer at night; and, strange as it may seem, few men would at times appear more devotional than he.\\nThe exercises of his family devotions were always commenced with singing; and, as he was a very poor singer himself, the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon me.\\nHe would read his hymn, and nod at me to commence.\\nI would at times do so; at others, I would not.\\nMy non-compliance would almost always produce much confusion.\\nTo show himself independent of me, he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner.\\nIn this state of mind, he prayed with more than ordinary spirit.\\nPoor man!\\nsuch was his disposition, and success at deceiving, I do verily believe that he sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief, that he was a sincere worshipper of the most high God; and this, too, at a time when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman slave to commit the sin of adultery.\\nThe facts in the case are these: Mr.\\nCovey was a poor man; he was just commencing in life; he was only able to buy one slave; and, shocking as is the fact, he bought her, as he said, for _a breeder_.\\nThis woman was named Caroline.\\nMr.\\nCovey bought her from Mr.\\nThomas Lowe, about six miles from St.\\nMichael\\'s.\\nShe was a large, able-bodied woman, about twenty years old.\\nShe had already given birth to one child, which proved her to be just what he wanted.\\nAfter buying her, he hired a married man of Mr.\\nSamuel Harrison, to live with him one year; and him he used to fasten up with her every night!\\nThe result was, that, at the end of the year, the miserable woman gave birth to twins.\\nAt this result Mr.\\nCovey seemed to be highly pleased, both with the man and the wretched woman.\\nSuch was his joy, and that of his wife, that nothing they could do for Caroline during her confinement was too good, or too hard, to be done.\\nThe children were regarded as being quite an addition to his wealth.\\nIf at any one time of my life more than another, I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr.\\nCovey.\\nWe were worked in all weathers.\\nIt was never too hot or too cold; it could never rain, blow, hail, or snow, too hard for us to work in the field.\\nWork, work, work, was scarcely more the order of the day than of the night.\\nThe longest days were too short for him, and the shortest nights too long for him.\\nI was somewhat unmanageable when I first went there, but a few months of this discipline tamed me.\\nMr.\\nCovey succeeded in breaking me.\\nI was broken in body, soul, and spirit.\\nMy natural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute!\\nSunday was my only leisure time.\\nI spent this in a sort of beast-like stupor, between sleep and wake, under some large tree.\\nAt times I would rise up, a flash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul, accompanied with a faint beam of hope, that flickered for a moment, and then vanished.\\nI sank down again, mourning over my wretched condition.\\nI was sometimes prompted to take my life, and that of Covey, but was prevented by a combination of hope and fear.\\nMy sufferings on this plantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality.\\nOur house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay, whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe.\\nThose beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to the eye of freemen, were to me so many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my wretched condition.\\nI have often, in the deep stillness of a summer\\'s Sabbath, stood all alone upon the lofty banks of that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful eye, the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean.\\nThe sight of these always affected me powerfully.\\nMy thoughts would compel utterance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour out my soul\\'s complaint, in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of ships:--  \"You are loosed from your moorings, and are free; I am fast in my chains, and am a slave!\\nYou move merrily before the gentle gale, and I sadly before the bloody whip!\\nYou are freedom\\'s swift-winged angels, that fly round the world; I am confined in bands of iron!\\nO that I were free!\\nO, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting wing!\\nAlas!\\nbetwixt me and you, the turbid waters roll.\\nGo on, go on.\\nO that I could also go!\\nCould I but swim!\\nIf I could fly!\\nO, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute!\\nThe glad ship is gone; she hides in the dim distance.\\nI am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery.\\nO God, save me!\\nGod, deliver me!\\nLet me be free!\\nIs there any God?\\nWhy am I a slave?\\nI will run away.\\nI will not stand it.\\nGet caught, or get clear, I\\'ll try it.\\nI had as well die with ague as the fever.\\nI have only one life to lose.\\nI had as well be killed running as die standing.\\nOnly think of it; one hundred miles straight north, and I am free!\\nTry it?\\nYes!\\nGod helping me, I will.\\nIt cannot be that I shall live and die a slave.\\nI will take to the water.\\nThis very bay shall yet bear me into freedom.\\nThe steamboats steered in a north-east course from North Point.\\nI will do the same; and when I get to the head of the bay, I will turn my canoe adrift, and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania.\\nWhen I get there, I shall not be required to have a pass; I can travel without being disturbed.\\nLet but the first opportunity offer, and, come what will, I am off.\\nMeanwhile, I will try to bear up under the yoke.\\nI am not the only slave in the world.\\nWhy should I fret?\\nI can bear as much as any of them.\\nBesides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound to some one.\\nIt may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free.\\nThere is a better day coming.\"\\nThus I used to think, and thus I used to speak to myself; goaded almost to madness at one moment, and at the next reconciling myself to my wretched lot.\\nI have already intimated that my condition was much worse, during the first six months of my stay at Mr.\\nCovey\\'s, than in the last six.\\nThe circumstances leading to the change in Mr.\\nCovey\\'s course toward me form an epoch in my humble history.\\nYou have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man.\\nOn one of the hottest days of the month of August, 1833, Bill Smith, William Hughes, a slave named Eli, and myself, were engaged in fanning wheat.\\nHughes was clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan.\\nEli was turning, Smith was feeding, and I was carrying wheat to the fan.\\nThe work was simple, requiring strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused to such work, it came very hard.\\nAbout three o\\'clock of that day, I broke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violent aching of the head, attended with extreme dizziness; I trembled in every limb.\\nFinding what was coming, I nerved myself up, feeling it would never do to stop work.\\nI stood as long as I could stagger to the hopper with grain.\\nWhen I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as if held down by an immense weight.\\nThe fan of course stopped; every one had his own work to do; and no one could do the work of the other, and have his own go on at the same time.\\nMr.\\nCovey was at the house, about one hundred yards from the treading-yard where we were fanning.\\nOn hearing the fan stop, he left immediately, and came to the spot where we were.\\nHe hastily inquired what the matter was.\\nBill answered that I was sick, and there was no one to bring wheat to the fan.\\nI had by this time crawled away under the side of the post and rail-fence by which the yard was enclosed, hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun.\\nHe then asked where I was.\\nHe was told by one of the hands.\\nHe came to the spot, and, after looking at me awhile, asked me what was the matter.\\nI told him as well as I could, for I scarce had strength to speak.\\nHe then gave me a savage kick in the side, and told me to get up.\\nI tried to do so, but fell back in the attempt.\\nHe gave me another kick, and again told me to rise.\\nI again tried, and succeeded in gaining my feet; but, stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding the fan, I again staggered and fell.\\nWhile down in this situation, Mr.\\nCovey took up the hickory slat with which Hughes had been striking off the half-bushel measure, and with it gave me a heavy blow upon the head, making a large wound, and the blood ran freely; and with this again told me to get up.\\nI made no effort to comply, having now made up my mind to let him do his worst.\\nIn a short time after receiving this blow, my head grew better.\\nMr.\\nCovey had now left me to my fate.\\nAt this moment I resolved, for the first time, to go to my master, enter a complaint, and ask his protection.\\nIn order to do this, I must that afternoon walk seven miles; and this, under the circumstances, was truly a severe undertaking.\\nI was exceedingly feeble; made so as much by the kicks and blows which I received, as by the severe fit of sickness to which I had been subjected.\\nI, however, watched my chance, while Covey was looking in an opposite direction, and started for St.\\nMichael\\'s.\\nI succeeded in getting a considerable distance on my way to the woods, when Covey discovered me, and called after me to come back, threatening what he would do if I did not come.\\nI disregarded both his calls and his threats, and made my way to the woods as fast as my feeble state would allow; and thinking I might be overhauled by him if I kept the road, I walked through the woods, keeping far enough from the road to avoid detection, and near enough to prevent losing my way.\\nI had not gone far before my little strength again failed me.\\nI could go no farther.\\nI fell down, and lay for a considerable time.\\nThe blood was yet oozing from the wound on my head.\\nFor a time I thought I should bleed to death; and think now that I should have done so, but that the blood so matted my hair as to stop the wound.\\nAfter lying there about three quarters of an hour, I nerved myself up again, and started on my way, through bogs and briers, barefooted and bareheaded, tearing my feet sometimes at nearly every step; and after a journey of about seven miles, occupying some five hours to perform it, I arrived at master\\'s store.\\nI then presented an appearance enough to affect any but a heart of iron.\\nFrom the crown of my head to my feet, I was covered with blood.\\nMy hair was all clotted with dust and blood; my shirt was stiff with blood.\\nI suppose I looked like a man who had escaped a den of wild beasts, and barely escaped them.\\nIn this state I appeared before my master, humbly entreating him to interpose his authority for my protection.\\nI told him all the circumstances as well as I could, and it seemed, as I spoke, at times to affect him.\\nHe would then walk the floor, and seek to justify Covey by saying he expected I deserved it.\\nHe asked me what I wanted.\\nI told him, to let me get a new home; that as sure as I lived with Mr.\\nCovey again, I should live with but to die with him; that Covey would surely kill me; he was in a fair way for it.\\nMaster Thomas ridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr.\\nCovey\\'s killing me, and said that he knew Mr.\\nCovey; that he was a good man, and that he could not think of taking me from him; that, should he do so, he would lose the whole year\\'s wages; that I belonged to Mr.\\nCovey for one year, and that I must go back to him, come what might; and that I must not trouble him with any more stories, or that he would himself _get hold of me_.\\nAfter threatening me thus, he gave me a very large dose of salts, telling me that I might remain in St.\\nMichael\\'s that night, (it being quite late,) but that I must be off back to Mr.\\nCovey\\'s early in the morning; and that if I did not, he would _get hold of me,_ which meant that he would whip me.\\nI remained all night, and, according to his orders, I started off to Covey\\'s in the morning, (Saturday morning,) wearied in body and broken in spirit.\\nI got no supper that night, or breakfast that morning.\\nI reached Covey\\'s about nine o\\'clock; and just as I was getting over the fence that divided Mrs.\\nKemp\\'s fields from ours, out ran Covey with his cowskin, to give me another whipping.\\nBefore he could reach me, I succeeded in getting to the cornfield; and as the corn was very high, it afforded me the means of hiding.\\nHe seemed very angry, and searched for me a long time.\\nMy behavior was altogether unaccountable.\\nHe finally gave up the chase, thinking, I suppose, that I must come home for something to eat; he would give himself no further trouble in looking for me.\\nI spent that day mostly in the woods, having the alternative before me,--to go home and be whipped to death, or stay in the woods and be starved to death.\\nThat night, I fell in with Sandy Jenkins, a slave with whom I was somewhat acquainted.\\nSandy had a free wife who lived about four miles from Mr.\\nCovey\\'s; and it being Saturday, he was on his way to see her.\\nI told him my circumstances, and he very kindly invited me to go home with him.\\nI went home with him, and talked this whole matter over, and got his advice as to what course it was best for me to pursue.\\nI found Sandy an old adviser.\\nHe told me, with great solemnity, I must go back to Covey; but that before I went, I must go with him into another part of the woods, where there was a certain _root,_ which, if I would take some of it with me, carrying it _always on my right side,_ would render it impossible for Mr.\\nCovey, or any other white man, to whip me.\\nHe said he had carried it for years; and since he had done so, he had never received a blow, and never expected to while he carried it.\\nI at first rejected the idea, that the simple carrying of a root in my pocket would have any such effect as he had said, and was not disposed to take it; but Sandy impressed the necessity with much earnestness, telling me it could do no harm, if it did no good.\\nTo please him, I at length took the root, and, according to his direction, carried it upon my right side.\\nThis was Sunday morning.\\nI immediately started for home; and upon entering the yard gate, out came Mr.\\nCovey on his way to meeting.\\nHe spoke to me very kindly, bade me drive the pigs from a lot near by, and passed on towards the church.\\nNow, this singular conduct of Mr.\\nCovey really made me begin to think that there was something in the _root_ which Sandy had given me; and had it been on any other day than Sunday, I could have attributed the conduct to no other cause than the influence of that root; and as it was, I was half inclined to think the _root_ to be something more than I at first had taken it to be.\\nAll went well till Monday morning.\\nOn this morning, the virtue of the _root_ was fully tested.\\nLong before daylight, I was called to go and rub, curry, and feed, the horses.\\nI obeyed, and was glad to obey.\\nBut whilst thus engaged, whilst in the act of throwing down some blades from the loft, Mr.\\nCovey entered the stable with a long rope; and just as I was half out of the loft, he caught hold of my legs, and was about tying me.\\nAs soon as I found what he was up to, I gave a sudden spring, and as I did so, he holding to my legs, I was brought sprawling on the stable floor.\\nMr.\\nCovey seemed now to think he had me, and could do what he pleased; but at this moment--from whence came the spirit I don\\'t know--I resolved to fight; and, suiting my action to the resolution, I seized Covey hard by the throat; and as I did so, I rose.\\nHe held on to me, and I to him.\\nMy resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey seemed taken all aback.\\nHe trembled like a leaf.\\nThis gave me assurance, and I held him uneasy, causing the blood to run where I touched him with the ends of my fingers.\\nMr.\\nCovey soon called out to Hughes for help.\\nHughes came, and, while Covey held me, attempted to tie my right hand.\\nWhile he was in the act of doing so, I watched my chance, and gave him a heavy kick close under the ribs.\\nThis kick fairly sickened Hughes, so that he left me in the hands of Mr.\\nCovey.\\nThis kick had the effect of not only weakening Hughes, but Covey also.\\nWhen he saw Hughes bending over with pain, his courage quailed.\\nHe asked me if I meant to persist in my resistance.\\nI told him I did, come what might; that he had used me like a brute for six months, and that I was determined to be used so no longer.\\nWith that, he strove to drag me to a stick that was lying just out of the stable door.\\nHe meant to knock me down.\\nBut just as he was leaning over to get the stick, I seized him with both hands by his collar, and brought him by a sudden snatch to the ground.\\nBy this time, Bill came.\\nCovey called upon him for assistance.\\nBill wanted to know what he could do.\\nCovey said, \"Take hold of him, take hold of him.\"\\nBill said his master hired him out to work, and not to help to whip me; so he left Covey and myself to fight our own battle out.\\nWe were at it for nearly two hours.\\nCovey at length let me go, puffing and blowing at a great rate, saying that if I had not resisted, he would not have whipped me half so much.\\nThe truth was, that he had not whipped me at all.\\nI considered him as getting entirely the worst end of the bargain; for he had drawn no blood from me, but I had from him.\\nThe whole six months afterwards, that I spent with Mr.\\nCovey, he never laid the weight of his finger upon me in anger.\\nHe would occasionally say, he didn\\'t want to get hold of me again.\\n\"No.\"\\nthought I, \"you need not; for you will come off worse than you did before.\"\\nThis battle with Mr.\\nCovey was the turning-point in my career as a slave.\\nIt rekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived within me a sense of my own manhood.\\nIt recalled the departed self-confidence, and inspired me again with a determination to be free.\\nThe gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow, even death itself.\\nHe only can understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has himself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery.\\nI felt as I never felt before.\\nIt was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom.\\nMy long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance took its place; and I now resolved that, however long I might remain a slave in form, the day had passed forever when I could be a slave in fact.\\nI did not hesitate to let it be known of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, must also succeed in killing me.\\nFrom this time I was never again what might be called fairly whipped, though I remained a slave four years afterwards.\\nI had several fights, but was never whipped.\\nIt was for a long time a matter of surprise to me why Mr.\\nCovey did not immediately have me taken by the constable to the whipping-post, and there regularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand against a white man in defence of myself.\\nAnd the only explanation I can now think of does not entirely satisfy me; but such as it is, I will give it.\\nMr.\\nCovey enjoyed the most unbounded reputation for being a first-rate overseer and negro-breaker.\\nIt was of considerable importance to him.\\nThat reputation was at stake; and had he sent me--a boy about sixteen years old--to the public whipping-post, his reputation would have been lost; so, to save his reputation, he suffered me to go unpunished.\\nMy term of actual service to Mr.\\nEdward Covey ended on Christmas day, 1833.\\nThe days between Christmas and New Year\\'s day are allowed as holidays; and, accordingly, we were not required to perform any labor, more than to feed and take care of the stock.\\nThis time we regarded as our own, by the grace of our masters; and we therefore used or abused it nearly as we pleased.\\nThose of us who had families at a distance, were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society.\\nThis time, however, was spent in various ways.\\nThe staid, sober, thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn-brooms, mats, horse-collars, and baskets; and another class of us would spend the time in hunting opossums, hares, and coons.\\nBut by far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball, wrestling, running foot-races, fiddling, dancing, and drinking whisky; and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters.\\nA slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them.\\nHe was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master.\\nIt was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas; and he was regarded as lazy indeed, who had not provided himself with the necessary means, during the year, to get whisky enough to last him through Christmas.\\nFrom what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave, I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection.\\nWere the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice, I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves.\\nThese holidays serve as conductors, or safety-valves, to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity.\\nBut for these, the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation; and woe betide the slaveholder, the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors!\\nI warn him that, in such an event, a spirit will go forth in their midst, more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake.\\nThe holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong, and inhumanity of slavery.\\nThey are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the result of selfishness, and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the down-trodden slave.\\nThey do not give the slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during its continuance, but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it.\\nThis will be seen by the fact, that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their ending as of their beginning.\\nTheir object seems to be, to disgust their slaves with freedom, by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation.\\nFor instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him drunk.\\nOne plan is, to make bets on their slaves, as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk; and in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess.\\nThus, when the slave asks for virtuous freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his ignorance, cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labelled with the name of liberty.\\nThe most of us used to drink it down, and the result was just what might be supposed; many of us were led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery.\\nWe felt, and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum.\\nSo, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field,--feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.\\nI have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of fraud and inhumanity of slavery.\\nIt is so.\\nThe mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom, by allowing him to see only the abuse of it, is carried out in other things.\\nFor instance, a slave loves molasses; he steals some.\\nHis master, in many cases, goes off to town, and buys a large quantity; he returns, takes his whip, and commands the slave to eat the molasses, until the poor fellow is made sick at the very mention of it.\\nThe same mode is sometimes adopted to make the slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance.\\nA slave runs through his allowance, and applies for more.\\nHis master is enraged at him; but, not willing to send him off without food, gives him more than is necessary, and compels him to eat it within a given time.\\nThen, if he complains that he cannot eat it, he is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting, and is whipped for being hard to please!\\nI have an abundance of such illustrations of the same principle, drawn from my own observation, but think the cases I have cited sufficient.\\nThe practice is a very common one.\\nOn the first of January, 1834, I left Mr.\\nCovey, and went to live with Mr.\\nWilliam Freeland, who lived about three miles from St.\\nMichael\\'s.\\nI soon found Mr.\\nFreeland a very different man from Mr.\\nCovey.\\nThough not rich, he was what would be called an educated southern gentleman.\\nMr.\\nCovey, as I have shown, was a well-trained negro-breaker and slave-driver.\\nThe former (slaveholder though he was) seemed to possess some regard for honor, some reverence for justice, and some respect for humanity.\\nThe latter seemed totally insensible to all such sentiments.\\nMr.\\nFreeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders, such as being very passionate and fretful; but I must do him the justice to say, that he was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which Mr.\\nCovey was constantly addicted.\\nThe one was open and frank, and we always knew where to find him.\\nThe other was a most artful deceiver, and could be understood only by such as were skilful enough to detect his cunningly-devised frauds.\\nAnother advantage I gained in my new master was, he made no pretensions to, or profession of, religion; and this, in my opinion, was truly a great advantage.\\nI assert most unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes,--a justifier of the most appalling barbarity,--a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds,--and a dark shelter under, which the darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection.\\nWere I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, next to that enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me.\\nFor of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst.\\nI have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others.\\nIt was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder, but to live in a community of such religionists.\\nVery near Mr.\\nFreeland lived the Rev.\\nDaniel Weeden, and in the same neighborhood lived the Rev.\\nRigby Hopkins.\\nThese were members and ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church.\\nMr.\\nWeeden owned, among others, a woman slave, whose name I have forgotten.\\nThis woman\\'s back, for weeks, was kept literally raw, made so by the lash of this merciless, _religious_ wretch.\\nHe used to hire hands.\\nHis maxim was, Behave well or behave ill, it is the duty of a master occasionally to whip a slave, to remind him of his master\\'s authority.\\nSuch was his theory, and such his practice.\\nMr.\\nHopkins was even worse than Mr.\\nWeeden.\\nHis chief boast was his ability to manage slaves.\\nThe peculiar feature of his government was that of whipping slaves in advance of deserving it.\\nHe always managed to have one or more of his slaves to whip every Monday morning.\\nHe did this to alarm their fears, and strike terror into those who escaped.\\nHis plan was to whip for the smallest offences, to prevent the commission of large ones.\\nMr.\\nHopkins could always find some excuse for whipping a slave.\\nIt would astonish one, unaccustomed to a slaveholding life, to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can find things, of which to make occasion to whip a slave.\\nA mere look, word, or motion,--a mistake, accident, or want of power,--are all matters for which a slave may be whipped at any time.\\nDoes a slave look dissatisfied?\\nIt is said, he has the devil in him, and it must be whipped out.\\nDoes he speak loudly when spoken to by his master?\\nThen he is getting high-minded, and should be taken down a button-hole lower.\\nDoes he forget to pull off his hat at the approach of a white person?\\nThen he is wanting in reverence, and should be whipped for it.\\nDoes he ever venture to vindicate his conduct, when censured for it?\\nThen he is guilty of impudence,--one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty.\\nDoes he ever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from that pointed out by his master?\\nHe is indeed presumptuous, and getting above himself; and nothing less than a flogging will do for him.\\nDoes he, while ploughing, break a plough,--or, while hoeing, break a hoe?\\nIt is owing to his carelessness, and for it a slave must always be whipped.\\nMr.\\nHopkins could always find something of this sort to justify the use of the lash, and he seldom failed to embrace such opportunities.\\nThere was not a man in the whole county, with whom the slaves who had the getting their own home, would not prefer to live, rather than with this Rev.\\nMr.\\nHopkins.\\nAnd yet there was not a man any where round, who made higher professions of religion, or was more active in revivals,--more attentive to the class, love-feast, prayer and preaching meetings, or more devotional in his family,--that prayed earlier, later, louder, and longer,--than this same reverend slave-driver, Rigby Hopkins.\\nBut to return to Mr.\\nFreeland, and to my experience while in his employment.\\nHe, like Mr.\\nCovey, gave us enough to eat; but, unlike Mr.\\nCovey, he also gave us sufficient time to take our meals.\\nHe worked us hard, but always between sunrise and sunset.\\nHe required a good deal of work to be done, but gave us good tools with which to work.\\nHis farm was large, but he employed hands enough to work it, and with ease, compared with many of his neighbors.\\nMy treatment, while in his employment, was heavenly, compared with what I experienced at the hands of Mr.\\nEdward Covey.\\nMr.\\nFreeland was himself the owner of but two slaves.\\nTheir names were Henry Harris and John Harris.\\nThe rest of his hands he hired.\\nThese consisted of myself, Sandy Jenkins,* and Handy Caldwell.\\n*This is the same man who gave me the roots to prevent my      being whipped by Mr.\\nCovey.\\nHe was \"a clever soul.\"\\nWe used      frequently to talk about the fight with Covey, and as often      as we did so, he would claim my success as the result of the      roots which he gave me.\\nThis superstition is very common      among the more ignorant slaves.\\nA slave seldom dies but that      his death is attributed to trickery.\\nHenry and John were quite intelligent, and in a very little while after I went there, I succeeded in creating in them a strong desire to learn how to read.\\nThis desire soon sprang up in the others also.\\nThey very soon mustered up some old spelling-books, and nothing would do but that I must keep a Sabbath school.\\nI agreed to do so, and accordingly devoted my Sundays to teaching these my loved fellow-slaves how to read.\\nNeither of them knew his letters when I went there.\\nSome of the slaves of the neighboring farms found what was going on, and also availed themselves of this little opportunity to learn to read.\\nIt was understood, among all who came, that there must be as little display about it as possible.\\nIt was necessary to keep our religious masters at St.\\nMichael\\'s unacquainted with the fact, that, instead of spending the Sabbath in wrestling, boxing, and drinking whisky, we were trying to learn how to read the will of God; for they had much rather see us engaged in those degrading sports, than to see us behaving like intellectual, moral, and accountable beings.\\nMy blood boils as I think of the bloody manner in which Messrs.\\nWright Fairbanks and Garrison West, both class-leaders, in connection with many others, rushed in upon us with sticks and stones, and broke up our virtuous little Sabbath school, at St.\\nMichael\\'s--all calling themselves Christians!\\nhumble followers of the Lord Jesus Christ!\\nBut I am again digressing.\\nI held my Sabbath school at the house of a free colored man, whose name I deem it imprudent to mention; for should it be known, it might embarrass him greatly, though the crime of holding the school was committed ten years ago.\\nI had at one time over forty scholars, and those of the right sort, ardently desiring to learn.\\nThey were of all ages, though mostly men and women.\\nI look back to those Sundays with an amount of pleasure not to be expressed.\\nThey were great days to my soul.\\nThe work of instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetest engagement with which I was ever blessed.\\nWe loved each other, and to leave them at the close of the Sabbath was a severe cross indeed.\\nWhen I think that these precious souls are to-day shut up in the prison-house of slavery, my feelings overcome me, and I am almost ready to ask, \"Does a righteous God govern the universe?\\nand for what does he hold the thunders in his right hand, if not to smite the oppressor, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler?\"\\nThese dear souls came not to Sabbath school because it was popular to do so, nor did I teach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged.\\nEvery moment they spent in that school, they were liable to be taken up, and given thirty-nine lashes.\\nThey came because they wished to learn.\\nTheir minds had been starved by their cruel masters.\\nThey had been shut up in mental darkness.\\nI taught them, because it was the delight of my soul to be doing something that looked like bettering the condition of my race.\\nI kept up my school nearly the whole year I lived with Mr.\\nFreeland; and, beside my Sabbath school, I devoted three evenings in the week, during the winter, to teaching the slaves at home.\\nAnd I have the happiness to know, that several of those who came to Sabbath school learned how to read; and that one, at least, is now free through my agency.\\nThe year passed off smoothly.\\nIt seemed only about half as long as the year which preceded it.\\nI went through it without receiving a single blow.\\nI will give Mr.\\nFreeland the credit of being the best master I ever had, _till I became my own master._ For the ease with which I passed the year, I was, however, somewhat indebted to the society of my fellow-slaves.\\nThey were noble souls; they not only possessed loving hearts, but brave ones.\\nWe were linked and interlinked with each other.\\nI loved them with a love stronger than any thing I have experienced since.\\nIt is sometimes said that we slaves do not love and confide in each other.\\nIn answer to this assertion, I can say, I never loved any or confided in any people more than my fellow-slaves, and especially those with whom I lived at Mr.\\nFreeland\\'s.\\nI believe we would have died for each other.\\nWe never undertook to do any thing, of any importance, without a mutual consultation.\\nWe never moved separately.\\nWe were one; and as much so by our tempers and dispositions, as by the mutual hardships to which we were necessarily subjected by our condition as slaves.\\nAt the close of the year 1834, Mr.\\nFreeland again hired me of my master, for the year 1835.\\nBut, by this time, I began to want to live _upon free land_ as well as _with Freeland;_ and I was no longer content, therefore, to live with him or any other slaveholder.\\nI began, with the commencement of the year, to prepare myself for a final struggle, which should decide my fate one way or the other.\\nMy tendency was upward.\\nI was fast approaching manhood, and year after year had passed, and I was still a slave.\\nThese thoughts roused me--I must do something.\\nI therefore resolved that 1835 should not pass without witnessing an attempt, on my part, to secure my liberty.\\nBut I was not willing to cherish this determination alone.\\nMy fellow-slaves were dear to me.\\nI was anxious to have them participate with me in this, my life-giving determination.\\nI therefore, though with great prudence, commenced early to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition, and to imbue their minds with thoughts of freedom.\\nI bent myself to devising ways and means for our escape, and meanwhile strove, on all fitting occasions, to impress them with the gross fraud and inhumanity of slavery.\\nI went first to Henry, next to John, then to the others.\\nI found, in them all, warm hearts and noble spirits.\\nThey were ready to hear, and ready to act when a feasible plan should be proposed.\\nThis was what I wanted.\\nI talked to them of our want of manhood, if we submitted to our enslavement without at least one noble effort to be free.\\nWe met often, and consulted frequently, and told our hopes and fears, recounted the difficulties, real and imagined, which we should be called on to meet.\\nAt times we were almost disposed to give up, and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot; at others, we were firm and unbending in our determination to go.\\nWhenever we suggested any plan, there was shrinking--the odds were fearful.\\nOur path was beset with the greatest obstacles; and if we succeeded in gaining the end of it, our right to be free was yet questionable--we were yet liable to be returned to bondage.\\nWe could see no spot, this side of the ocean, where we could be free.\\nWe knew nothing about Canada.\\nOur knowledge of the north did not extend farther than New York; and to go there, and be forever harassed with the frightful liability of being returned to slavery--with the certainty of being treated tenfold worse than before--the thought was truly a horrible one, and one which it was not easy to overcome.\\nThe case sometimes stood thus: At every gate through which we were to pass, we saw a watchman--at every ferry a guard--on every bridge a sentinel--and in every wood a patrol.\\nWe were hemmed in upon every side.\\nHere were the difficulties, real or imagined--the good to be sought, and the evil to be shunned.\\nOn the one hand, there stood slavery, a stern reality, glaring frightfully upon us,--its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions, and even now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh.\\nOn the other hand, away back in the dim distance, under the flickering light of the north star, behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain, stood a doubtful freedom--half frozen--beckoning us to come and share its hospitality.\\nThis in itself was sometimes enough to stagger us; but when we permitted ourselves to survey the road, we were frequently appalled.\\nUpon either side we saw grim death, assuming the most horrid shapes.\\nNow it was starvation, causing us to eat our own flesh;--now we were contending with the waves, and were drowned;--now we were overtaken, and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound.\\nWe were stung by scorpions, chased by wild beasts, bitten by snakes, and finally, after having nearly reached the desired spot,--after swimming rivers, encountering wild beasts, sleeping in the woods, suffering hunger and nakedness,--we were overtaken by our pursuers, and, in our resistance, we were shot dead upon the spot!\\nI say, this picture sometimes appalled us, and made us        \"rather bear those ills we had,      Than fly to others, that we knew not of.\"\\nIn coming to a fixed determination to run away, we did more than Patrick Henry, when he resolved upon liberty or death.\\nWith us it was a doubtful liberty at most, and almost certain death if we failed.\\nFor my part, I should prefer death to hopeless bondage.\\nSandy, one of our number, gave up the notion, but still encouraged us.\\nOur company then consisted of Henry Harris, John Harris, Henry Bailey, Charles Roberts, and myself.\\nHenry Bailey was my uncle, and belonged to my master.\\nCharles married my aunt: he belonged to my master\\'s father-in-law, Mr.\\nWilliam Hamilton.\\nThe plan we finally concluded upon was, to get a large canoe belonging to Mr.\\nHamilton, and upon the Saturday night previous to Easter holidays, paddle directly up the Chesapeake Bay.\\nOn our arrival at the head of the bay, a distance of seventy or eighty miles from where we lived, it was our purpose to turn our canoe adrift, and follow the guidance of the north star till we got beyond the limits of Maryland.\\nOur reason for taking the water route was, that we were less liable to be suspected as runaways; we hoped to be regarded as fishermen; whereas, if we should take the land route, we should be subjected to interruptions of almost every kind.\\nAny one having a white face, and being so disposed, could stop us, and subject us to examination.\\nThe week before our intended start, I wrote several protections, one for each of us.\\nAs well as I can remember, they were in the following words, to wit:--        \"This is to certify that I, the undersigned, have given the bearer, my      servant, full liberty to go to Baltimore, and spend the Easter holidays.\\nWritten with mine own hand, &amp;c., 1835.\\n\"WILLIAM HAMILTON,   \"Near St.\\nMichael\\'s, in Talbot county, Maryland.\"\\nWe were not going to Baltimore; but, in going up the bay, we went toward Baltimore, and these protections were only intended to protect us while on the bay.\\nAs the time drew near for our departure, our anxiety became more and more intense.\\nIt was truly a matter of life and death with us.\\nThe strength of our determination was about to be fully tested.\\nAt this time, I was very active in explaining every difficulty, removing every doubt, dispelling every fear, and inspiring all with the firmness indispensable to success in our undertaking; assuring them that half was gained the instant we made the move; we had talked long enough; we were now ready to move; if not now, we never should be; and if we did not intend to move now, we had as well fold our arms, sit down, and acknowledge ourselves fit only to be slaves.\\nThis, none of us were prepared to acknowledge.\\nEvery man stood firm; and at our last meeting, we pledged ourselves afresh, in the most solemn manner, that, at the time appointed, we would certainly start in pursuit of freedom.\\nThis was in the middle of the week, at the end of which we were to be off.\\nWe went, as usual, to our several fields of labor, but with bosoms highly agitated with thoughts of our truly hazardous undertaking.\\nWe tried to conceal our feelings as much as possible; and I think we succeeded very well.\\nAfter a painful waiting, the Saturday morning, whose night was to witness our departure, came.\\nI hailed it with joy, bring what of sadness it might.\\nFriday night was a sleepless one for me.\\nI probably felt more anxious than the rest, because I was, by common consent, at the head of the whole affair.\\nThe responsibility of success or failure lay heavily upon me.\\nThe glory of the one, and the confusion of the other, were alike mine.\\nThe first two hours of that morning were such as I never experienced before, and hope never to again.\\nEarly in the morning, we went, as usual, to the field.\\nWe were spreading manure; and all at once, while thus engaged, I was overwhelmed with an indescribable feeling, in the fulness of which I turned to Sandy, who was near by, and said, \"We are betrayed.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nsaid he, \"that thought has this moment struck me.\"\\nWe said no more.\\nI was never more certain of any thing.\\nThe horn was blown as usual, and we went up from the field to the house for breakfast.\\nI went for the form, more than for want of any thing to eat that morning.\\nJust as I got to the house, in looking out at the lane gate, I saw four white men, with two colored men.\\nThe white men were on horseback, and the colored ones were walking behind, as if tied.\\nI watched them a few moments till they got up to our lane gate.\\nHere they halted, and tied the colored men to the gate-post.\\nI was not yet certain as to what the matter was.\\nIn a few moments, in rode Mr.\\nHamilton, with a speed betokening great excitement.\\nHe came to the door, and inquired if Master William was in.\\nHe was told he was at the barn.\\nMr.\\nHamilton, without dismounting, rode up to the barn with extraordinary speed.\\nIn a few moments, he and Mr.\\nFreeland returned to the house.\\nBy this time, the three constables rode up, and in great haste dismounted, tied their horses, and met Master William and Mr.\\nHamilton returning from the barn; and after talking awhile, they all walked up to the kitchen door.\\nThere was no one in the kitchen but myself and John.\\nHenry and Sandy were up at the barn.\\nMr.\\nFreeland put his head in at the door, and called me by name, saying, there were some gentlemen at the door who wished to see me.\\nI stepped to the door, and inquired what they wanted.\\nThey at once seized me, and, without giving me any satisfaction, tied me--lashing my hands closely together.\\nI insisted upon knowing what the matter was.\\nThey at length said, that they had learned I had been in a \"scrape.\"\\nand that I was to be examined before my master; and if their information proved false, I should not be hurt.\\nIn a few moments, they succeeded in tying John.\\nThey then turned to Henry, who had by this time returned, and commanded him to cross his hands.\\n\"I won\\'t.\"\\nsaid Henry, in a firm tone, indicating his readiness to meet the consequences of his refusal.\\n\"Won\\'t you?\"\\nsaid Tom Graham, the constable.\\n\"No, I won\\'t.\"\\nsaid Henry, in a still stronger tone.\\nWith this, two of the constables pulled out their shining pistols, and swore, by their Creator, that they would make him cross his hands or kill him.\\nEach cocked his pistol, and, with fingers on the trigger, walked up to Henry, saying, at the same time, if he did not cross his hands, they would blow his damned heart out.\\n\"Shoot me, shoot me.\"\\nsaid Henry; \"you can\\'t kill me but once.\\nShoot, shoot,--and be damned!\\n_I won\\'t be tied!.\"\\nThis he said in a tone of loud defiance; and at the same time, with a motion as quick as lightning, he with one single stroke dashed the pistols from the hand of each constable.\\nAs he did this, all hands fell upon him, and, after beating him some time, they finally overpowered him, and got him tied.\\nDuring the scuffle, I managed, I know not how, to get my pass out, and, without being discovered, put it into the fire.\\nWe were all now tied; and just as we were to leave for Easton jail, Betsy Freeland, mother of William Freeland, came to the door with her hands full of biscuits, and divided them between Henry and John.\\nShe then delivered herself of a speech, to the following effect:--addressing herself to me, she said, \"_You devil!\\nYou yellow devil!_ it was you that put it into the heads of Henry and John to run away.\\nBut for you, you long-legged mulatto devil!\\nHenry nor John would never have thought of such a thing.\"\\nI made no reply, and was immediately hurried off towards St.\\nMichael\\'s.\\nJust a moment previous to the scuffle with Henry, Mr.\\nHamilton suggested the propriety of making a search for the protections which he had understood Frederick had written for himself and the rest.\\nBut, just at the moment he was about carrying his proposal into effect, his aid was needed in helping to tie Henry; and the excitement attending the scuffle caused them either to forget, or to deem it unsafe, under the circumstances, to search.\\nSo we were not yet convicted of the intention to run away.\\nWhen we got about half way to St.\\nMichael\\'s, while the constables having us in charge were looking ahead, Henry inquired of me what he should do with his pass.\\nI told him to eat it with his biscuit, and own nothing; and we passed the word around, \"_Own nothing;.\"\\nand \"_Own nothing!.\"\\nsaid we all.\\nOur confidence in each other was unshaken.\\nWe were resolved to succeed or fail together, after the calamity had befallen us as much as before.\\nWe were now prepared for any thing.\\nWe were to be dragged that morning fifteen miles behind horses, and then to be placed in the Easton jail.\\nWhen we reached St.\\nMichael\\'s, we underwent a sort of examination.\\nWe all denied that we ever intended to run away.\\nWe did this more to bring out the evidence against us, than from any hope of getting clear of being sold; for, as I have said, we were ready for that.\\nThe fact was, we cared but little where we went, so we went together.\\nOur greatest concern was about separation.\\nWe dreaded that more than any thing this side of death.\\nWe found the evidence against us to be the testimony of one person; our master would not tell who it was; but we came to a unanimous decision among ourselves as to who their informant was.\\nWe were sent off to the jail at Easton.\\nWhen we got there, we were delivered up to the sheriff, Mr.\\nJoseph Graham, and by him placed in jail.\\nHenry, John, and myself, were placed in one room together--Charles, and Henry Bailey, in another.\\nTheir object in separating us was to hinder concert.\\nWe had been in jail scarcely twenty minutes, when a swarm of slave traders, and agents for slave traders, flocked into jail to look at us, and to ascertain if we were for sale.\\nSuch a set of beings I never saw before!\\nI felt myself surrounded by so many fiends from perdition.\\nA band of pirates never looked more like their father, the devil.\\nThey laughed and grinned over us, saying, \"Ah, my boys!\\nwe have got you, haven\\'t we?\"\\nAnd after taunting us in various ways, they one by one went into an examination of us, with intent to ascertain our value.\\nThey would impudently ask us if we would not like to have them for our masters.\\nWe would make them no answer, and leave them to find out as best they could.\\nThen they would curse and swear at us, telling us that they could take the devil out of us in a very little while, if we were only in their hands.\\nWhile in jail, we found ourselves in much more comfortable quarters than we expected when we went there.\\nWe did not get much to eat, nor that which was very good; but we had a good clean room, from the windows of which we could see what was going on in the street, which was very much better than though we had been placed in one of the dark, damp cells.\\nUpon the whole, we got along very well, so far as the jail and its keeper were concerned.\\nImmediately after the holidays were over, contrary to all our expectations, Mr.\\nHamilton and Mr.\\nFreeland came up to Easton, and took Charles, the two Henrys, and John, out of jail, and carried them home, leaving me alone.\\nI regarded this separation as a final one.\\nIt caused me more pain than any thing else in the whole transaction.\\nI was ready for any thing rather than separation.\\nI supposed that they had consulted together, and had decided that, as I was the whole cause of the intention of the others to run away, it was hard to make the innocent suffer with the guilty; and that they had, therefore, concluded to take the others home, and sell me, as a warning to the others that remained.\\nIt is due to the noble Henry to say, he seemed almost as reluctant at leaving the prison as at leaving home to come to the prison.\\nBut we knew we should, in all probability, be separated, if we were sold; and since he was in their hands, he concluded to go peaceably home.\\nI was now left to my fate.\\nI was all alone, and within the walls of a stone prison.\\nBut a few days before, and I was full of hope.\\nI expected to have been safe in a land of freedom; but now I was covered with gloom, sunk down to the utmost despair.\\nI thought the possibility of freedom was gone.\\nI was kept in this way about one week, at the end of which, Captain Auld, my master, to my surprise and utter astonishment, came up, and took me out, with the intention of sending me, with a gentleman of his acquaintance, into Alabama.\\nBut, from some cause or other, he did not send me to Alabama, but concluded to send me back to Baltimore, to live again with his brother Hugh, and to learn a trade.\\nThus, after an absence of three years and one month, I was once more permitted to return to my old home at Baltimore.\\nMy master sent me away, because there existed against me a very great prejudice in the community, and he feared I might be killed.\\nIn a few weeks after I went to Baltimore, Master Hugh hired me to Mr.\\nWilliam Gardner, an extensive ship-builder, on Fell\\'s Point.\\nI was put there to learn how to calk.\\nIt, however, proved a very unfavorable place for the accomplishment of this object.\\nMr.\\nGardner was engaged that spring in building two large man-of-war brigs, professedly for the Mexican government.\\nThe vessels were to be launched in the July of that year, and in failure thereof, Mr.\\nGardner was to lose a considerable sum; so that when I entered, all was hurry.\\nThere was no time to learn any thing.\\nEvery man had to do that which he knew how to do.\\nIn entering the shipyard, my orders from Mr.\\nGardner were, to do whatever the carpenters commanded me to do.\\nThis was placing me at the beck and call of about seventy-five men.\\nI was to regard all these as masters.\\nTheir word was to be my law.\\nMy situation was a most trying one.\\nAt times I needed a dozen pair of hands.\\nI was called a dozen ways in the space of a single minute.\\nThree or four voices would strike my ear at the same moment.\\nIt was--\"Fred., come help me to cant this timber here.\"--\"Fred., come carry this timber yonder.\"--\"Fred., bring that roller here.\"--\"Fred., go get a fresh can of water.\"--\"Fred., come help saw off the end of this timber.\"--\"Fred., go quick, and get the crowbar.\"--\"Fred., hold on the end of this fall.\"--\"Fred., go to the blacksmith\\'s shop, and get a new punch.\"--\"Hurra, Fred!\\nrun and bring me a cold chisel.\"--\"I say, Fred., bear a hand, and get up a fire as quick as lightning under that steam-box.\"--\"Halloo, nigger!\\ncome, turn this grindstone.\"--\"Come, come!\\nmove, move!\\nand _bowse_ this timber forward.\"--\"I say, darky, blast your eyes, why don\\'t you heat up some pitch?\"--\"Halloo!\\nhalloo!\\nhalloo.\"\\n(Three voices at the same time.) \"Come here!--Go there!--Hold on where you are!\\nDamn you, if you move, I\\'ll knock your brains out.\"\\nThis was my school for eight months; and I might have remained there longer, but for a most horrid fight I had with four of the white apprentices, in which my left eye was nearly knocked out, and I was horribly mangled in other respects.\\nThe facts in the case were these: Until a very little while after I went there, white and black ship-carpenters worked side by side, and no one seemed to see any impropriety in it.\\nAll hands seemed to be very well satisfied.\\nMany of the black carpenters were freemen.\\nThings seemed to be going on very well.\\nAll at once, the white carpenters knocked off, and said they would not work with free colored workmen.\\nTheir reason for this, as alleged, was, that if free colored carpenters were encouraged, they would soon take the trade into their own hands, and poor white men would be thrown out of employment.\\nThey therefore felt called upon at once to put a stop to it.\\nAnd, taking advantage of Mr.\\nGardner\\'s necessities, they broke off, swearing they would work no longer, unless he would discharge his black carpenters.\\nNow, though this did not extend to me in form, it did reach me in fact.\\nMy fellow-apprentices very soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me.\\nThey began to put on airs, and talk about the \"nigger.\"\\ntaking the country, saying we all ought to be killed; and, being encouraged by the journeymen, they commenced making my condition as hard as they could, by hectoring me around, and sometimes striking me.\\nI, of course, kept the vow I made after the fight with Mr.\\nCovey, and struck back again, regardless of consequences; and while I kept them from combining, I succeeded very well; for I could whip the whole of them, taking them separately.\\nThey, however, at length combined, and came upon me, armed with sticks, stones, and heavy handspikes.\\nOne came in front with a half brick.\\nThere was one at each side of me, and one behind me.\\nWhile I was attending to those in front, and on either side, the one behind ran up with the handspike, and struck me a heavy blow upon the head.\\nIt stunned me.\\nI fell, and with this they all ran upon me, and fell to beating me with their fists.\\nI let them lay on for a while, gathering strength.\\nIn an instant, I gave a sudden surge, and rose to my hands and knees.\\nJust as I did that, one of their number gave me, with his heavy boot, a powerful kick in the left eye.\\nMy eyeball seemed to have burst.\\nWhen they saw my eye closed, and badly swollen, they left me.\\nWith this I seized the handspike, and for a time pursued them.\\nBut here the carpenters interfered, and I thought I might as well give it up.\\nIt was impossible to stand my hand against so many.\\nAll this took place in sight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters, and not one interposed a friendly word; but some cried, \"Kill the damned nigger!\\nKill him!\\nkill him!\\nHe struck a white person.\"\\nI found my only chance for life was in flight.\\nI succeeded in getting away without an additional blow, and barely so; for to strike a white man is death by Lynch law,--and that was the law in Mr.\\nGardner\\'s ship-yard; nor is there much of any other out of Mr.\\nGardner\\'s ship-yard.\\nI went directly home, and told the story of my wrongs to Master Hugh; and I am happy to say of him, irreligious as he was, his conduct was heavenly, compared with that of his brother Thomas under similar circumstances.\\nHe listened attentively to my narration of the circumstances leading to the savage outrage, and gave many proofs of his strong indignation at it.\\nThe heart of my once overkind mistress was again melted into pity.\\nMy puffed-out eye and blood-covered face moved her to tears.\\nShe took a chair by me, washed the blood from my face, and, with a mother\\'s tenderness, bound up my head, covering the wounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef.\\nIt was almost compensation for my suffering to witness, once more, a manifestation of kindness from this, my once affectionate old mistress.\\nMaster Hugh was very much enraged.\\nHe gave expression to his feelings by pouring out curses upon the heads of those who did the deed.\\nAs soon as I got a little the better of my bruises, he took me with him to Esquire Watson\\'s, on Bond Street, to see what could be done about the matter.\\nMr.\\nWatson inquired who saw the assault committed.\\nMaster Hugh told him it was done in Mr.\\nGardner\\'s ship-yard at midday, where there were a large company of men at work.\\n\"As to that.\"\\nhe said, \"the deed was done, and there was no question as to who did it.\"\\nHis answer was, he could do nothing in the case, unless some white man would come forward and testify.\\nHe could issue no warrant on my word.\\nIf I had been killed in the presence of a thousand colored people, their testimony combined would have been insufficient to have arrested one of the murderers.\\nMaster Hugh, for once, was compelled to say this state of things was too bad.\\nOf course, it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his testimony in my behalf, and against the white young men.\\nEven those who may have sympathized with me were not prepared to do this.\\nIt required a degree of courage unknown to them to do so; for just at that time, the slightest manifestation of humanity toward a colored person was denounced as abolitionism, and that name subjected its bearer to frightful liabilities.\\nThe watchwords of the bloody-minded in that region, and in those days, were, \"Damn the abolitionists.\"\\nand \"Damn the niggers.\"\\nThere was nothing done, and probably nothing would have been done if I had been killed.\\nSuch was, and such remains, the state of things in the Christian city of Baltimore.\\nMaster Hugh, finding he could get no redress, refused to let me go back again to Mr.\\nGardner.\\nHe kept me himself, and his wife dressed my wound till I was again restored to health.\\nHe then took me into the ship-yard of which he was foreman, in the employment of Mr.\\nWalter Price.\\nThere I was immediately set to calking, and very soon learned the art of using my mallet and irons.\\nIn the course of one year from the time I left Mr.\\nGardner\\'s, I was able to command the highest wages given to the most experienced calkers.\\nI was now of some importance to my master.\\nI was bringing him from six to seven dollars per week.\\nI sometimes brought him nine dollars per week: my wages were a dollar and a half a day.\\nAfter learning how to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own contracts, and collected the money which I earned.\\nMy pathway became much more smooth than before; my condition was now much more comfortable.\\nWhen I could get no calking to do, I did nothing.\\nDuring these leisure times, those old notions about freedom would steal over me again.\\nWhen in Mr.\\nGardner\\'s employment, I was kept in such a perpetual whirl of excitement, I could think of nothing, scarcely, but my life; and in thinking of my life, I almost forgot my liberty.\\nI have observed this in my experience of slavery,--that whenever my condition was improved, instead of its increasing my contentment, it only increased my desire to be free, and set me to thinking of plans to gain my freedom.\\nI have found that, to make a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one.\\nIt is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason.\\nHe must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery; he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought to that only when he ceases to be a man.\\nI was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day.\\nI contracted for it; I earned it; it was paid to me; it was rightfully my own; yet, upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled to deliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh.\\nAnd why?\\nNot because he earned it,--not because he had any hand in earning it,--not because I owed it to him,--nor because he possessed the slightest shadow of a right to it; but solely because he had the power to compel me to give it up.\\nThe right of the grim-visaged pirate upon the high seas is exactly the same.\\nBut before narrating any of the peculiar circumstances, I deem it proper to make known my intention not to state all the facts connected with the transaction.\\nMy reasons for pursuing this course may be understood from the following: First, were I to give a minute statement of all the facts, it is not only possible, but quite probable, that others would thereby be involved in the most embarrassing difficulties.\\nSecondly, such a statement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part of slaveholders than has existed heretofore among them; which would, of course, be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape his galling chains.\\nI deeply regret the necessity that impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my experience in slavery.\\nIt would afford me great pleasure indeed, as well as materially add to the interest of my narrative, were I at liberty to gratify a curiosity, which I know exists in the minds of many, by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my most fortunate escape.\\nBut I must deprive myself of this pleasure, and the curious of the gratification which such a statement would afford.\\nI would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which evil-minded men might suggest, rather than exculpate myself, and thereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a brother slave might clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery.\\nI have never approved of the very public manner in which some of our western friends have conducted what they call the _underground railroad,_ but which I think, by their open declarations, has been made most emphatically the _upper-ground railroad._ I honor those good men and women for their noble daring, and applaud them for willingly subjecting themselves to bloody persecution, by openly avowing their participation in the escape of slaves.\\nI, however, can see very little good resulting from such a course, either to themselves or the slaves escaping; while, upon the other hand, I see and feel assured that those open declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining, who are seeking to escape.\\nThey do nothing towards enlightening the slave, whilst they do much towards enlightening the master.\\nThey stimulate him to greater watchfulness, and enhance his power to capture his slave.\\nWe owe something to the slave south of the line as well as to those north of it; and in aiding the latter on their way to freedom, we should be careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the former from escaping from slavery.\\nI would keep the merciless slaveholder profoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave.\\nI would leave him to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors, ever ready to snatch from his infernal grasp his trembling prey.\\nLet him be left to feel his way in the dark; let darkness commensurate with his crime hover over him; and let him feel that at every step he takes, in pursuit of the flying bondman, he is running the frightful risk of having his hot brains dashed out by an invisible agency.\\nLet us render the tyrant no aid; let us not hold the light by which he can trace the footprints of our flying brother.\\nBut enough of this.\\nI will now proceed to the statement of those facts, connected with my escape, for which I am alone responsible, and for which no one can be made to suffer but myself.\\nIn the early part of the year 1838, I became quite restless.\\nI could see no reason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my toil into the purse of my master.\\nWhen I carried to him my weekly wages, he would, after counting the money, look me in the face with a robber-like fierceness, and ask, \"Is this all?\"\\nHe was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent.\\nHe would, however, when I made him six dollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourage me.\\nIt had the opposite effect.\\nI regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole.\\nThe fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof, to my mind, that he believed me entitled to the whole of them.\\nI always felt worse for having received any thing; for I feared that the giving me a few cents would ease his conscience, and make him feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort of robber.\\nMy discontent grew upon me.\\nI was ever on the look-out for means of escape; and, finding no direct means, I determined to try to hire my time, with a view of getting money with which to make my escape.\\nIn the spring of 1838, when Master Thomas came to Baltimore to purchase his spring goods, I got an opportunity, and applied to him to allow me to hire my time.\\nHe unhesitatingly refused my request, and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape.\\nHe told me I could go nowhere but that he could get me; and that, in the event of my running away, he should spare no pains in his efforts to catch me.\\nHe exhorted me to content myself, and be obedient.\\nHe told me, if I would be happy, I must lay out no plans for the future.\\nHe said, if I behaved myself properly, he would take care of me.\\nIndeed, he advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future, and taught me to depend solely upon him for happiness.\\nHe seemed to see fully the pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature, in order to contentment in slavery.\\nBut in spite of him, and even in spite of myself, I continued to think, and to think about the injustice of my enslavement, and the means of escape.\\nAbout two months after this, I applied to Master Hugh for the privilege of hiring my time.\\nHe was not acquainted with the fact that I had applied to Master Thomas, and had been refused.\\nHe too, at first, seemed disposed to refuse; but, after some reflection, he granted me the privilege, and proposed the following terms: I was to be allowed all my time, make all contracts with those for whom I worked, and find my own employment; and, in return for this liberty, I was to pay him three dollars at the end of each week; find myself in calking tools, and in board and clothing.\\nMy board was two dollars and a half per week.\\nThis, with the wear and tear of clothing and calking tools, made my regular expenses about six dollars per week.\\nThis amount I was compelled to make up, or relinquish the privilege of hiring my time.\\nRain or shine, work or no work, at the end of each week the money must be forthcoming, or I must give up my privilege.\\nThis arrangement, it will be perceived, was decidedly in my master\\'s favor.\\nIt relieved him of all need of looking after me.\\nHis money was sure.\\nHe received all the benefits of slaveholding without its evils; while I endured all the evils of a slave, and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman.\\nI found it a hard bargain.\\nBut, hard as it was, I thought it better than the old mode of getting along.\\nIt was a step towards freedom to be allowed to bear the responsibilities of a freeman, and I was determined to hold on upon it.\\nI bent myself to the work of making money.\\nI was ready to work at night as well as day, and by the most untiring perseverance and industry, I made enough to meet my expenses, and lay up a little money every week.\\nI went on thus from May till August.\\nMaster Hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer.\\nThe ground for his refusal was a failure on my part, one Saturday night, to pay him for my week\\'s time.\\nThis failure was occasioned by my attending a camp meeting about ten miles from Baltimore.\\nDuring the week, I had entered into an engagement with a number of young friends to start from Baltimore to the camp ground early Saturday evening; and being detained by my employer, I was unable to get down to Master Hugh\\'s without disappointing the company.\\nI knew that Master Hugh was in no special need of the money that night.\\nI therefore decided to go to camp meeting, and upon my return pay him the three dollars.\\nI staid at the camp meeting one day longer than I intended when I left.\\nBut as soon as I returned, I called upon him to pay him what he considered his due.\\nI found him very angry; he could scarce restrain his wrath.\\nHe said he had a great mind to give me a severe whipping.\\nHe wished to know how I dared go out of the city without asking his permission.\\nI told him I hired my time and while I paid him the price which he asked for it, I did not know that I was bound to ask him when and where I should go.\\nThis reply troubled him; and, after reflecting a few moments, he turned to me, and said I should hire my time no longer; that the next thing he should know of, I would be running away.\\nUpon the same plea, he told me to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith.\\nI did so; but instead of seeking work, as I had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time, I spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke of work.\\nI did this in retaliation.\\nSaturday night, he called upon me as usual for my week\\'s wages.\\nI told him I had no wages; I had done no work that week.\\nHere we were upon the point of coming to blows.\\nHe raved, and swore his determination to get hold of me.\\nI did not allow myself a single word; but was resolved, if he laid the weight of his hand upon me, it should be blow for blow.\\nHe did not strike me, but told me that he would find me in constant employment in future.\\nI thought the matter over during the next day, Sunday, and finally resolved upon the third day of September, as the day upon which I would make a second attempt to secure my freedom.\\nI now had three weeks during which to prepare for my journey.\\nEarly on Monday morning, before Master Hugh had time to make any engagement for me, I went out and got employment of Mr.\\nButler, at his ship-yard near the drawbridge, upon what is called the City Block, thus making it unnecessary for him to seek employment for me.\\nAt the end of the week, I brought him between eight and nine dollars.\\nHe seemed very well pleased, and asked why I did not do the same the week before.\\nHe little knew what my plans were.\\nMy object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent to run away; and in this I succeeded admirably.\\nI suppose he thought I was never better satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which I was planning my escape.\\nThe second week passed, and again I carried him my full wages; and so well pleased was he, that he gave me twenty-five cents, (quite a large sum for a slaveholder to give a slave,) and bade me to make a good use of it.\\nI told him I would.\\nThings went on without very smoothly indeed, but within there was trouble.\\nIt is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of my contemplated start drew near.\\nI had a number of warmhearted friends in Baltimore,--friends that I loved almost as I did my life,--and the thought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond expression.\\nIt is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery, who now remain, but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to their friends.\\nThe thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most painful thought with which I had to contend.\\nThe love of them was my tender point, and shook my decision more than all things else.\\nBesides the pain of separation, the dread and apprehension of a failure exceeded what I had experienced at my first attempt.\\nThe appalling defeat I then sustained returned to torment me.\\nI felt assured that, if I failed in this attempt, my case would be a hopeless one--it would seal my fate as a slave forever.\\nI could not hope to get off with any thing less than the severest punishment, and being placed beyond the means of escape.\\nIt required no very vivid imagination to depict the most frightful scenes through which I should have to pass, in case I failed.\\nThe wretchedness of slavery, and the blessedness of freedom, were perpetually before me.\\nIt was life and death with me.\\nBut I remained firm, and, according to my resolution, on the third day of September, 1838, I left my chains, and succeeded in reaching New York without the slightest interruption of any kind.\\nHow I did so,--what means I adopted,--what direction I travelled, and by what mode of conveyance,--I must leave unexplained, for the reasons before mentioned.\\nI have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free State.\\nI have never been able to answer the question with any satisfaction to myself.\\nIt was a moment of the highest excitement I ever experienced.\\nI suppose I felt as one may imagine the unarmed mariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendly man-of-war from the pursuit of a pirate.\\nIn writing to a dear friend, immediately after my arrival at New York, I said I felt like one who had escaped a den of hungry lions.\\nThis state of mind, however, very soon subsided; and I was again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness.\\nI was yet liable to be taken back, and subjected to all the tortures of slavery.\\nThis in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm.\\nBut the loneliness overcame me.\\nThere I was in the midst of thousands, and yet a perfect stranger; without home and without friends, in the midst of thousands of my own brethren--children of a common Father, and yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition.\\nI was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one, and thereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers, whose business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive, as the ferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey.\\nThe motto which I adopted when I started from slavery was this--\"Trust no man.\"\\nI saw in every white man an enemy, and in almost every colored man cause for distrust.\\nIt was a most painful situation; and, to understand it, one must needs experience it, or imagine himself in similar circumstances.\\nLet him be a fugitive slave in a strange land--a land given up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders--whose inhabitants are legalized kidnappers--where he is every moment subjected to the terrible liability of being seized upon by his fellowmen, as the hideous crocodile seizes upon his prey!--I say, let him place himself in my situation--without home or friends--without money or credit--wanting shelter, and no one to give it--wanting bread, and no money to buy it,--and at the same time let him feel that he is pursued by merciless men-hunters, and in total darkness as to what to do, where to go, or where to stay,--perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and means of escape,--in the midst of plenty, yet suffering the terrible gnawings of hunger,--in the midst of houses, yet having no home,--among fellow-men, yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts, whose greediness to swallow up the trembling and half-famished fugitive is only equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which they subsist,--I say, let him be placed in this most trying situation,--the situation in which I was placed,--then, and not till then, will he fully appreciate the hardships of, and know how to sympathize with, the toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave.\\nThank Heaven, I remained but a short time in this distressed situation.\\nI was relieved from it by the humane hand of _Mr.\\nDavid Ruggles_, whose vigilance, kindness, and perseverance, I shall never forget.\\nI am glad of an opportunity to express, as far as words can, the love and gratitude I bear him.\\nMr.\\nRuggles is now afflicted with blindness, and is himself in need of the same kind offices which he was once so forward in the performance of toward others.\\nI had been in New York but a few days, when Mr.\\nRuggles sought me out, and very kindly took me to his boarding-house at the corner of Church and Lespenard Streets.\\nMr.\\nRuggles was then very deeply engaged in the memorable _Darg_ case, as well as attending to a number of other fugitive slaves, devising ways and means for their successful escape; and, though watched and hemmed in on almost every side, he seemed to be more than a match for his enemies.\\nVery soon after I went to Mr.\\nRuggles, he wished to know of me where I wanted to go; as he deemed it unsafe for me to remain in New York.\\nI told him I was a calker, and should like to go where I could get work.\\nI thought of going to Canada; but he decided against it, and in favor of my going to New Bedford, thinking I should be able to get work there at my trade.\\nAt this time, Anna,* my intended wife, came on; for I wrote to her immediately after my arrival at New York, (notwithstanding my homeless, houseless, and helpless condition,) informing her of my successful flight, and wishing her to come on forthwith.\\nIn a few days after her arrival, Mr.\\nRuggles called in the Rev.\\nJ.\\nW.\\nC.\\nPennington, who, in the presence of Mr.\\nRuggles, Mrs.\\nMichaels, and two or three others, performed the marriage ceremony, and gave us a certificate, of which the following is an exact copy:--   \"This may certify, that I joined together in holy matrimony Frederick Johnson** and Anna Murray, as man and wife, in the presence of Mr.\\nDavid Ruggles and Mrs.\\nMichaels.\\n\"JAMES W.\\nC.\\nPENNINGTON \"_New York, Sept.\\n15, 1838.\"\\n*She was free.\\n**I had changed my name from Frederick _Bailey_ to that of           _Johnson_.\\nUpon receiving this certificate, and a five-dollar bill from Mr.\\nRuggles, I shouldered one part of our baggage, and Anna took up the other, and we set out forthwith to take passage on board of the steamboat John W.\\nRichmond for Newport, on our way to New Bedford.\\nMr.\\nRuggles gave me a letter to a Mr.\\nShaw in Newport, and told me, in case my money did not serve me to New Bedford, to stop in Newport and obtain further assistance; but upon our arrival at Newport, we were so anxious to get to a place of safety, that, notwithstanding we lacked the necessary money to pay our fare, we decided to take seats in the stage, and promise to pay when we got to New Bedford.\\nWe were encouraged to do this by two excellent gentlemen, residents of New Bedford, whose names I afterward ascertained to be Joseph Ricketson and William C.\\nTaber.\\nThey seemed at once to understand our circumstances, and gave us such assurance of their friendliness as put us fully at ease in their presence.\\nIt was good indeed to meet with such friends, at such a time.\\nUpon reaching New Bedford, we were directed to the house of Mr.\\nNathan Johnson, by whom we were kindly received, and hospitably provided for.\\nBoth Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nJohnson took a deep and lively interest in our welfare.\\nThey proved themselves quite worthy of the name of abolitionists.\\nWhen the stage-driver found us unable to pay our fare, he held on upon our baggage as security for the debt.\\nI had but to mention the fact to Mr.\\nJohnson, and he forthwith advanced the money.\\nWe now began to feel a degree of safety, and to prepare ourselves for the duties and responsibilities of a life of freedom.\\nOn the morning after our arrival at New Bedford, while at the breakfast-table, the question arose as to what name I should be called by.\\nThe name given me by my mother was, \"Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey.\"\\nI, however, had dispensed with the two middle names long before I left Maryland so that I was generally known by the name of \"Frederick Bailey.\"\\nI started from Baltimore bearing the name of \"Stanley.\"\\nWhen I got to New York, I again changed my name to \"Frederick Johnson.\"\\nand thought that would be the last change.\\nBut when I got to New Bedford, I found it necessary again to change my name.\\nThe reason of this necessity was, that there were so many Johnsons in New Bedford, it was already quite difficult to distinguish between them.\\nI gave Mr.\\nJohnson the privilege of choosing me a name, but told him he must not take from me the name of \"Frederick.\"\\nI must hold on to that, to preserve a sense of my identity.\\nMr.\\nJohnson had just been reading the \"Lady of the Lake.\"\\nand at once suggested that my name be \"Douglass.\"\\nFrom that time until now I have been called \"Frederick Douglass.\"\\nand as I am more widely known by that name than by either of the others, I shall continue to use it as my own.\\nI was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New Bedford.\\nThe impression which I had received respecting the character and condition of the people of the north, I found to be singularly erroneous.\\nI had very strangely supposed, while in slavery, that few of the comforts, and scarcely any of the luxuries, of life were enjoyed at the north, compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the south.\\nI probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern people owned no slaves.\\nI supposed that they were about upon a level with the non-slaveholding population of the south.\\nI knew _they_ were exceedingly poor, and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders.\\nI had somehow imbibed the opinion that, in the absence of slaves, there could be no wealth, and very little refinement.\\nAnd upon coming to the north, I expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, and uncultivated population, living in the most Spartan-like simplicity, knowing nothing of the ease, luxury, pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders.\\nSuch being my conjectures, any one acquainted with the appearance of New Bedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my mistake.\\nIn the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford, I visited the wharves, to take a view of the shipping.\\nHere I found myself surrounded with the strongest proofs of wealth.\\nLying at the wharves, and riding in the stream, I saw many ships of the finest model, in the best order, and of the largest size.\\nUpon the right and left, I was walled in by granite warehouses of the widest dimensions, stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life.\\nAdded to this, almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore.\\nThere were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships.\\nI heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer.\\nI saw no whipping of men; but all seemed to go smoothly on.\\nEvery man appeared to understand his work, and went at it with a sober, yet cheerful earnestness, which betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing, as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man.\\nTo me this looked exceedingly strange.\\nFrom the wharves I strolled around and over the town, gazing with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches, beautiful dwellings, and finely-cultivated gardens; evincing an amount of wealth, comfort, taste, and refinement, such as I had never seen in any part of slaveholding Maryland.\\nEvery thing looked clean, new, and beautiful.\\nI saw few or no dilapidated houses, with poverty-stricken inmates; no half-naked children and barefooted women, such as I had been accustomed to see in Hillsborough, Easton, St.\\nMichael\\'s, and Baltimore.\\nThe people looked more able, stronger, healthier, and happier, than those of Maryland.\\nI was for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth, without being saddened by seeing extreme poverty.\\nBut the most astonishing as well as the most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored people, a great many of whom, like myself, had escaped thither as a refuge from the hunters of men.\\nI found many, who had not been seven years out of their chains, living in finer houses, and evidently enjoying more of the comforts of life, than the average of slaveholders in Maryland.\\nI will venture to assert, that my friend Mr.\\nNathan Johnson (of whom I can say with a grateful heart, \"I was hungry, and he gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink; I was a stranger, and he took me in\") lived in a neater house; dined at a better table; took, paid for, and read, more newspapers; better understood the moral, religious, and political character of the nation,--than nine tenths of the slaveholders in Talbot county Maryland.\\nYet Mr.\\nJohnson was a working man.\\nHis hands were hardened by toil, and not his alone, but those also of Mrs.\\nJohnson.\\nI found the colored people much more spirited than I had supposed they would be.\\nI found among them a determination to protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper, at all hazards.\\nSoon after my arrival, I was told of a circumstance which illustrated their spirit.\\nA colored man and a fugitive slave were on unfriendly terms.\\nThe former was heard to threaten the latter with informing his master of his whereabouts.\\nStraightway a meeting was called among the colored people, under the stereotyped notice, \"Business of importance.\"\\nThe betrayer was invited to attend.\\nThe people came at the appointed hour, and organized the meeting by appointing a very religious old gentleman as president, who, I believe, made a prayer, after which he addressed the meeting as follows: \"_Friends, we have got him here, and I would recommend that you young men just take him outside the door, and kill him!.\"\\nWith this, a number of them bolted at him; but they were intercepted by some more timid than themselves, and the betrayer escaped their vengeance, and has not been seen in New Bedford since.\\nI believe there have been no more such threats, and should there be hereafter, I doubt not that death would be the consequence.\\nI found employment, the third day after my arrival, in stowing a sloop with a load of oil.\\nIt was new, dirty, and hard work for me; but I went at it with a glad heart and a willing hand.\\nI was now my own master.\\nIt was a happy moment, the rapture of which can be understood only by those who have been slaves.\\nIt was the first work, the reward of which was to be entirely my own.\\nThere was no Master Hugh standing ready, the moment I earned the money, to rob me of it.\\nI worked that day with a pleasure I had never before experienced.\\nI was at work for myself and newly-married wife.\\nIt was to me the starting-point of a new existence.\\nWhen I got through with that job, I went in pursuit of a job of calking; but such was the strength of prejudice against color, among the white calkers, that they refused to work with me, and of course I could get no employment.*        * I am told that colored persons can now get employment at      calking in New Bedford&mdash;a result of anti-slavery effort.\\nFinding my trade of no immediate benefit, I threw off my calking habiliments, and prepared myself to do any kind of work I could get to do.\\nMr.\\nJohnson kindly let me have his wood-horse and saw, and I very soon found myself a plenty of work.\\nThere was no work too hard--none too dirty.\\nI was ready to saw wood, shovel coal, carry wood, sweep the chimney, or roll oil casks,--all of which I did for nearly three years in New Bedford, before I became known to the anti-slavery world.\\nIn about four months after I went to New Bedford, there came a young man to me, and inquired if I did not wish to take the \"Liberator.\"\\nI told him I did; but, just having made my escape from slavery, I remarked that I was unable to pay for it then.\\nI, however, finally became a subscriber to it.\\nThe paper came, and I read it from week to week with such feelings as it would be quite idle for me to attempt to describe.\\nThe paper became my meat and my drink.\\nMy soul was set all on fire.\\nIts sympathy for my brethren in bonds--its scathing denunciations of slaveholders--its faithful exposures of slavery--and its powerful attacks upon the upholders of the institution--sent a thrill of joy through my soul, such as I had never felt before!\\nI had not long been a reader of the \"Liberator.\"\\nbefore I got a pretty correct idea of the principles, measures and spirit of the anti-slavery reform.\\nI took right hold of the cause.\\nI could do but little; but what I could, I did with a joyful heart, and never felt happier than when in an anti-slavery meeting.\\nI seldom had much to say at the meetings, because what I wanted to say was said so much better by others.\\nBut, while attending an anti-slavery convention at Nantucket, on the 11th of August, 1841, I felt strongly moved to speak, and was at the same time much urged to do so by Mr.\\nWilliam C.\\nCoffin, a gentleman who had heard me speak in the colored people\\'s meeting at New Bedford.\\nIt was a severe cross, and I took it up reluctantly.\\nThe truth was, I felt myself a slave, and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me down.\\nI spoke but a few moments, when I felt a degree of freedom, and said what I desired with considerable ease.\\nFrom that time until now, I have been engaged in pleading the cause of my brethren--with what success, and with what devotion, I leave those acquainted with my labors to decide.\\nAPPENDIX  I find, since reading over the foregoing Narrative, that I have, in several instances, spoken in such a tone and manner, respecting religion, as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my religious views to suppose me an opponent of all religion.\\nTo remove the liability of such misapprehension, I deem it proper to append the following brief explanation.\\nWhat I have said respecting and against religion, I mean strictly to apply to the _slaveholding religion_ of this land, and with no possible reference to Christianity proper; for, between the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest possible difference--so wide, that to receive the one as good, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, and wicked.\\nTo be the friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy of the other.\\nI love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land.\\nIndeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity.\\nI look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels.\\nNever was there a clearer case of \"stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in.\"\\nI am filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious pomp and show, together with the horrible inconsistencies, which every where surround me.\\nWe have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members.\\nThe man who wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday, and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus.\\nThe man who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me as a class-leader on Sunday morning, to show me the way of life, and the path of salvation.\\nHe who sells my sister, for purposes of prostitution, stands forth as the pious advocate of purity.\\nHe who proclaims it a religious duty to read the Bible denies me the right of learning to read the name of the God who made me.\\nHe who is the religious advocate of marriage robs whole millions of its sacred influence, and leaves them to the ravages of wholesale pollution.\\nThe warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same that scatters whole families,--sundering husbands and wives, parents and children, sisters and brothers,--leaving the hut vacant, and the hearth desolate.\\nWe see the thief preaching against theft, and the adulterer against adultery.\\nWe have men sold to build churches, women sold to support the gospel, and babes sold to purchase Bibles for the _Poor Heathen!\\nAll For The Glory Of God And The Good Of Souls!_ The slave auctioneer\\'s bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other, and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his pious master.\\nRevivals of religion and revivals in the slave-trade go hand in hand together.\\nThe slave prison and the church stand near each other.\\nThe clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in the prison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church, may be heard at the same time.\\nThe dealers in the bodies and souls of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other.\\nThe dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity.\\nHere we have religion and robbery the allies of each other--devils dressed in angels\\' robes, and hell presenting the semblance of paradise.\\n\"Just God!\\nand these are they,      Who minister at thine altar, God of right!\\nMen who their hands, with prayer and blessing, lay      On Israel\\'s ark of light.\\n\"What!\\npreach, and kidnap men?\\nGive thanks, and rob thy own afflicted poor?\\nTalk of thy glorious liberty, and then      Bolt hard the captive\\'s door?\\n\"What!\\nservants of thy own      Merciful Son, who came to seek and save      The homeless and the outcast, fettering down      The tasked and plundered slave!\\n\"Pilate and Herod friends!\\nChief priests and rulers, as of old, combine!\\nJust God and holy!\\nis that church which lends      Strength to the spoiler thine?\"\\nThe Christianity of America is a Christianity, of whose votaries it may be as truly said, as it was of the ancient scribes and Pharisees, \"They bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men\\'s shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.\\nAll their works they do for to be seen of men.--They love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, .\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nand to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.--But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\\nfor ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.\\nYe devour widows\\' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.\\nYe compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.--Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\\nfor ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.\\nYe blind guides!\\nwhich strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.\\nWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\\nfor ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but within, they are full of extortion and excess.--Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\\nfor ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men\\'s bones, and of all uncleanness.\\nEven so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\"\\nDark and terrible as is this picture, I hold it to be strictly true of the overwhelming mass of professed Christians in America.\\nThey strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.\\nCould any thing be more true of our churches?\\nThey would be shocked at the proposition of fellowshipping a _sheep_-stealer; and at the same time they hug to their communion a _man_-stealer, and brand me with being an infidel, if I find fault with them for it.\\nThey attend with Pharisaical strictness to the outward forms of religion, and at the same time neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith.\\nThey are always ready to sacrifice, but seldom to show mercy.\\nThey are they who are represented as professing to love God whom they have not seen, whilst they hate their brother whom they have seen.\\nThey love the heathen on the other side of the globe.\\nThey can pray for him, pay money to have the Bible put into his hand, and missionaries to instruct him; while they despise and totally neglect the heathen at their own doors.\\nSuch is, very briefly, my view of the religion of this land; and to avoid any misunderstanding, growing out of the use of general terms, I mean by the religion of this land, that which is revealed in the words, deeds, and actions, of those bodies, north and south, calling themselves Christian churches, and yet in union with slaveholders.\\nIt is against religion, as presented by these bodies, that I have felt it my duty to testify.\\nI conclude these remarks by copying the following portrait of the religion of the south, (which is, by communion and fellowship, the religion of the north,) which I soberly affirm is \"true to the life.\"\\nand without caricature or the slightest exaggeration.\\nIt is said to have been drawn, several years before the present anti-slavery agitation began, by a northern Methodist preacher, who, while residing at the south, had an opportunity to see slaveholding morals, manners, and piety, with his own eyes.\\n\"Shall I not visit for these things?\\nsaith the Lord.\\nShall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?\"\\n<b>A PARODY</b>       \"Come, saints and sinners, hear me tell      How pious priests whip Jack and Nell,      And women buy and children sell,      And preach

light on the American slave system, and hastening the glad day of deliverance to the millions of my brethren in bonds--faithfully relying upon the power of truth, love, and justice, for success in my humble efforts--and solemnly pledging my self anew to the sacred cause,--I subscribe myself,  FREDERICK DOUGLASS.\\nLYNN, _Mass., April_ 28, 1845.\\nTHE END\\nProduced by an anonymous Project

that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.\\nAll emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.\\nHe was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.\\nHe never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.\\nThey were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men\\'s motives and actions.\\nBut for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.\\nGrit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.\\nAnd yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately.\\nMy marriage had drifted us away from each other.\\nMy own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.\\nHe was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.\\nBeyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\nOne night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street.\\nAs I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.\\nHis rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind.\\nHe was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him.\\nTo me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story.\\nHe was at work again.\\nHe had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.\\nI rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\\nHis manner was not effusive.\\nIt seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me.\\nWith hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.\\nThen he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\n\"Wedlock suits you.\"\\nhe remarked.\\n\"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"\\n\"Seven.\"\\nI answered.\\n\"Indeed, I should have thought a little more.\\nJust a trifle more, I fancy, Watson.\\nAnd in practice again, I observe.\\nYou did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"\\n\"Then, how do you know?\"\\n\"I see it, I deduce it.\\nHow do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\"\\n\"My dear Holmes.\"\\nsaid I, \"this is too much.\\nYou would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.\\nIt is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\\'t imagine how you deduce it.\\nAs to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\"\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n\"It is simplicity itself.\"\\nsaid he; \"my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.\\nObviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.\\nHence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.\\nAs to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\"\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction.\\n\"When I hear you give your reasons.\"\\nI remarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process.\\nAnd yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\"\\n\"Quite so.\"\\nhe answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair.\\n\"You see, but you do not observe.\\nThe distinction is clear.\\nFor example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\\n\"Frequently.\"\\n\"How often?\"\\n\"Well, some hundreds of times.\"\\n\"Then how many are there?\"\\n\"How many?\\nI don\\'t know.\"\\n\"Quite so!\\nYou have not observed.\\nAnd yet you have seen.\\nThat is just my point.\\nNow, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.\\nBy-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\"\\nHe threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.\\n\"It came by the last post.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Read it aloud.\"\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n\"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\\'clock.\"\\nit said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment.\\nYour recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received.\\nBe in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\"\\n\"This is indeed a mystery.\"\\nI remarked.\\n\"What do you imagine that it means?\"\\n\"I have no data yet.\\nIt is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.\\nInsensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.\\nBut the note itself.\\nWhat do you deduce from it?\"\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\\n\"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do.\"\\nI remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion\\'s processes.\\n\"Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet.\\nIt is peculiarly strong and stiff.\"\\n\"Peculiar--that is the very word.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"It is not an English paper at all.\\nHold it up to the light.\"\\nI did so, and saw a large \".\"\\nwith a small \"g.\"\\na \"P.\"\\nand a large \".\"\\nwith a small \".\"\\nwoven into the texture of the paper.\\n\"What do you make of that?\"\\nasked Holmes.\\n\"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"\\n\"Not at all.\\nThe \\'G\\' with the small \\'t\\' stands for \\'Gesellschaft,\\' which is the German for \\'Company.\\' It is a customary contraction like our \\'Co.\\' \\'P,\\' of course, stands for \\'Papier.\\' Now for the \\'Eg.\\' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\"\\nHe took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.\\n\"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria.\\nIt is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.\\n\\'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\\' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\"\\nHis eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\\n\"The paper was made in Bohemia.\"\\nI said.\\n\"Precisely.\\nAnd the man who wrote the note is a German.\\nDo you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--\\'This account of you we have from all quarters received.\\' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that.\\nIt is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs.\\nIt only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face.\\nAnd here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\"\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\\' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell.\\nHolmes whistled.\\n\"A pair, by the sound.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nhe continued, glancing out of the window.\\n\"A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties.\\nA hundred and fifty guineas apiece.\\nThere\\'s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\"\\n\"I think that I had better go, Holmes.\"\\n\"Not a bit, Doctor.\\nStay where you are.\\nI am lost without my Boswell.\\nAnd this promises to be interesting.\\nIt would be a pity to miss it.\"\\n\"But your client-.\"\\n\"Never mind him.\\nI may want your help, and so may he.\\nHere he comes.\\nSit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\"\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door.\\nThen there was a loud and authoritative tap.\\n\"Come in.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules.\\nHis dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste.\\nHeavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl.\\nBoots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance.\\nHe carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.\\nFrom the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\\n\"You had my note?\"\\nhe asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent.\\n\"I told you that I would call.\"\\nHe looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n\"Pray take a seat.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.\\nWhom have I the honour to address?\"\\n\"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.\\nI understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance.\\nIf not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\"\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair.\\n\"It is both, or none.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\"\\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders.\\n\"Then I must begin.\"\\nsaid he, \"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance.\\nAt present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\"\\n\"I promise.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"And I.\"\\n\"You will excuse this mask.\"\\ncontinued our strange visitor.\\n\"The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\"\\n\"I was aware of it.\"\\nsaid Holmes dryly.\\n\"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe.\\nTo speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\"\\n\"I was also aware of that.\"\\nmurmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.\\nHolmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n\"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case.\"\\nhe remarked, \"I should be better able to advise you.\"\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.\\nThen, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.\\n\"You are right.\"\\nhe cried; \"I am the King.\\nWhy should I attempt to conceal it?\"\\n\"Why, indeed?\"\\nmurmured Holmes.\\n\"Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\"\\n\"But you can understand.\"\\nsaid our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.\\nYet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power.\\nI have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\"\\n\"Then, pray consult.\"\\nsaid Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n\"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler.\\nThe name is no doubt familiar to you.\"\\n\"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor.\"\\nmurmured Holmes without opening his eyes.\\nFor many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information.\\nIn this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\n\"Let me see.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Hum!\\nBorn in New Jersey in the year 1858.\\nContralto--hum!\\nLa Scala, hum!\\nPrima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes!\\nRetired from operatic stage--ha!\\nLiving in London--quite so!\\nYour Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\"\\n\"Precisely so.\\nBut how-.\"\\n\"Was there a secret marriage?\"\\n\"None.\"\\n\"No legal papers or certificates?\"\\n\"None.\"\\n\"Then I fail to follow your Majesty.\\nIf this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\"\\n\"There is the writing.\"\\n\"Pooh, pooh!\\nForgery.\"\\n\"My private note-paper.\"\\n\"Stolen.\"\\n\"My own seal.\"\\n\"Imitated.\"\\n\"My photograph.\"\\n\"Bought.\"\\n\"We were both in the photograph.\"\\n\"Oh, dear!\\nThat is very bad!\\nYour Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.\"\\n\"I was mad--insane.\"\\n\"You have compromised yourself seriously.\"\\n\"I was only Crown Prince then.\\nI was young.\\nI am but thirty now.\"\\n\"It must be recovered.\"\\n\"We have tried and failed.\"\\n\"Your Majesty must pay.\\nIt must be bought.\"\\n\"She will not sell.\"\\n\"Stolen, then.\"\\n\"Five attempts have been made.\\nTwice burglars in my pay ransacked her house.\\nOnce we diverted her luggage when she travelled.\\nTwice she has been waylaid.\\nThere has been no result.\"\\n\"No sign of it?\"\\n\"Absolutely none.\"\\nHolmes laughed.\\n\"It is quite a pretty little problem.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"But a very serious one to me.\"\\nreturned the King reproachfully.\\n\"Very, indeed.\\nAnd what does she propose to do with the photograph?\"\\n\"To ruin me.\"\\n\"But how?\"\\n\"I am about to be married.\"\\n\"So I have heard.\"\\n\"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia.\\nYou may know the strict principles of her family.\\nShe is herself the very soul of delicacy.\\nA shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\"\\n\"And Irene Adler?\"\\n\"Threatens to send them the photograph.\\nAnd she will do it.\\nI know that she will do it.\\nYou do not know her, but she has a soul of steel.\\nShe has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men.\\nRather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none.\"\\n\"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"\\n\"I am sure.\"\\n\"And why?\"\\n\"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed.\\nThat will be next Monday.\"\\n\"Oh, then we have three days yet.\"\\nsaid Holmes with a yawn.\\n\"That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present.\\nYour Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\"\\n\"Certainly.\\nYou will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\"\\n\"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"\\n\"Pray do so.\\nI shall be all anxiety.\"\\n\"Then, as to money?\"\\n\"You have carte blanche.\"\\n\"Absolutely?\"\\n\"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\"\\n\"And for present expenses?\"\\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.\\n\"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes.\"\\nhe said.\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.\\n\"And Mademoiselle\\'s address?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St.\\nJohn\\'s Wood.\"\\nHolmes took a note of it.\\n\"One other question.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Was the photograph a cabinet?\"\\n\"It was.\"\\n\"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you.\\nAnd good-night, Watson.\"\\nhe added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street.\\n\"If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\\'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\"\\nII.\\nAt three o\\'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.\\nThe landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o\\'clock in the morning.\\nI sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.\\nI was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.\\nIndeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.\\nSo accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.\\nAccustomed as I was to my friend\\'s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he.\\nWith a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.\\nPutting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.\\n\"Well, really.\"\\nhe cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\"It\\'s quite too funny.\\nI am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\"\\n\"I can\\'t imagine.\\nI suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\"\\n\"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual.\\nI will tell you, however.\\nI left the house a little after eight o\\'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work.\\nThere is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men.\\nBe one of them, and you will know all that there is to know.\\nI soon found Briony Lodge.\\nIt is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories.\\nChubb lock to the door.\\nLarge sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.\\nBehind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house.\\nI walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.\\n\"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden.\\nI lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\"\\n\"And what of Irene Adler?\"\\nI asked.\\n\"Oh, she has turned all the men\\'s heads down in that part.\\nShe is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet.\\nSo say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.\\nShe lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.\\nSeldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.\\nHas only one male visitor, but a good deal of him.\\nHe is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice.\\nHe is a Mr.\\nGodfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple.\\nSee the advantages of a cabman as a confidant.\\nThey had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.\\nWhen I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.\\n\"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\\nHe was a lawyer.\\nThat sounded ominous.\\nWhat was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits?\\nWas she his client, his friend, or his mistress?\\nIf the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping.\\nIf the latter, it was less likely.\\nOn the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\\'s chambers in the Temple.\\nIt was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry.\\nI fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.\"\\n\"I am following you closely.\"\\nI answered.\\n\"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out.\\nHe was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard.\\nHe appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.\\n\"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms.\\nOf her I could see nothing.\\nPresently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before.\\nAs he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, \\'Drive like the devil,\\' he shouted, \\'first to Gross & Hankey\\'s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St.\\nMonica in the Edgeware Road.\\nHalf a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\\'\\n\"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.\\nIt hadn\\'t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it.\\nI only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\\n\"\\'The Church of St.\\nMonica, John,\\' she cried, \\'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\\'\\n\"This was quite too good to lose, Watson.\\nI was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street.\\nThe driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object.\\n\\'The Church of St.\\nMonica,\\' said I, \\'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\\' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\\n\"My cabby drove fast.\\nI don\\'t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us.\\nThe cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived.\\nI paid the man and hurried into the church.\\nThere was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them.\\nThey were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar.\\nI lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.\\nSuddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\\n\"\\'Thank God,\\' he cried.\\n\\'You\\'ll do.\\nCome!\\nCome!\\'\\n\"\\'What then?\\' I asked.\\n\"\\'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\\'t be legal.\\'\\n\"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor.\\nIt was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front.\\nIt was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now.\\nIt seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man.\\nThe bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\"\\n\"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs.\"\\nsaid I; \"and what then?\"\\n\"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced.\\nIt looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part.\\nAt the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house.\\n\\'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,\\' she said as she left him.\\nI heard no more.\\nThey drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\"\\n\"Which are?\"\\n\"Some cold beef and a glass of beer.\"\\nhe answered, ringing the bell.\\n\"I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening.\\nBy the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\"\\n\"I shall be delighted.\"\\n\"You don\\'t mind breaking the law?\"\\n\"Not in the least.\"\\n\"Nor running a chance of arrest?\"\\n\"Not in a good cause.\"\\n\"Oh, the cause is excellent.\"\\n\"Then I am your man.\"\\n\"I was sure that I might rely on you.\"\\n\"But what is it you wish?\"\\n\"When Mrs.\\nTurner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\\nNow.\"\\nhe said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, \"I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.\\nIt is nearly five now.\\nIn two hours we must be on the scene of action.\\nMiss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven.\\nWe must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\"\\n\"And what then?\"\\n\"You must leave that to me.\\nI have already arranged what is to occur.\\nThere is only one point on which I must insist.\\nYou must not interfere, come what may.\\nYou understand?\"\\n\"I am to be neutral?\"\\n\"To do nothing whatever.\\nThere will probably be some small unpleasantness.\\nDo not join in it.\\nIt will end in my being conveyed into the house.\\nFour or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open.\\nYou are to station yourself close to that open window.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.\\nYou quite follow me?\"\\n\"Entirely.\"\\n\"It is nothing very formidable.\"\\nhe said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket.\\n\"It is an ordinary plumber\\'s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.\\nYour task is confined to that.\\nWhen you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.\\nYou may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.\\nI hope that I have made myself clear?\"\\n\"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\"\\n\"Precisely.\"\\n\"Then you may entirely rely on me.\"\\n\"That is excellent.\\nI think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.\"\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman.\\nHis broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr.\\nJohn Hare alone could have equalled.\\nIt was not merely that Holmes changed his costume.\\nHis expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.\\nThe stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue.\\nIt was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant.\\nThe house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\\' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected.\\nOn the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated.\\nThere was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.\\n\"You see.\"\\nremarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, \"this marriage rather simplifies matters.\\nThe photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now.\\nThe chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr.\\nGodfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess.\\nNow the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?\"\\n\"Where, indeed?\"\\n\"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her.\\nIt is cabinet size.\\nToo large for easy concealment about a woman\\'s dress.\\nShe knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched.\\nTwo attempts of the sort have already been made.\\nWe may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\"\\n\"Where, then?\"\\n\"Her banker or her lawyer.\\nThere is that double possibility.\\nBut I am inclined to think neither.\\nWomen are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting.\\nWhy should she hand it over to anyone else?\\nShe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man.\\nBesides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days.\\nIt must be where she can lay her hands upon it.\\nIt must be in her own house.\"\\n\"But it has twice been burgled.\"\\n\"Pshaw!\\nThey did not know how to look.\"\\n\"But how will you look?\"\\n\"I will not look.\"\\n\"What then?\"\\n\"I will get her to show me.\"\\n\"But she will refuse.\"\\n\"She will not be able to.\\nBut I hear the rumble of wheels.\\nIt is her carriage.\\nNow carry out my orders to the letter.\"\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue.\\nIt was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge.\\nAs it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention.\\nA fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.\\nA blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks.\\nHolmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face.\\nAt his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man.\\nIrene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.\\n\"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?\"\\nshe asked.\\n\"He is dead.\"\\ncried several voices.\\n\"No, no, there\\'s life in him.\"\\nshouted another.\\n\"But he\\'ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\"\\n\"He\\'s a brave fellow.\"\\nsaid a woman.\\n\"They would have had the lady\\'s purse and watch if it hadn\\'t been for him.\\nThey were a gang, and a rough one, too.\\nAh, he\\'s breathing now.\"\\n\"He can\\'t lie in the street.\\nMay we bring him in, marm?\"\\n\"Surely.\\nBring him into the sitting-room.\\nThere is a comfortable sofa.\\nThis way, please.\"\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window.\\nThe lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch.\\nI do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man.\\nAnd yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.\\nI hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.\\nAfter all, I thought, we are not injuring her.\\nWe are but preventing her from injuring another.\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air.\\nA maid rushed across and threw open the window.\\nAt the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \"Fire.\"\\nThe word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of \"Fire.\"\\nThick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window.\\nI caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.\\nSlipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\\'s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.\\nHe walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\\n\"You did it very nicely, Doctor.\"\\nhe remarked.\\n\"Nothing could have been better.\\nIt is all right.\"\\n\"You have the photograph?\"\\n\"I know where it is.\"\\n\"And how did you find out?\"\\n\"She showed me, as I told you she would.\"\\n\"I am still in the dark.\"\\n\"I do not wish to make a mystery.\"\\nsaid he, laughing.\\n\"The matter was perfectly simple.\\nYou, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice.\\nThey were all engaged for the evening.\"\\n\"I guessed as much.\"\\n\"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand.\\nI rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle.\\nIt is an old trick.\"\\n\"That also I could fathom.\"\\n\"Then they carried me in.\\nShe was bound to have me in.\\nWhat else could she do?\\nAnd into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected.\\nIt lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which.\\nThey laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\"\\n\"How did that help you?\"\\n\"It was all-important.\\nWhen a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.\\nIt is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it.\\nIn the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business.\\nA married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of.\\nShe would rush to secure it.\\nThe alarm of fire was admirably done.\\nThe smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel.\\nShe responded beautifully.\\nThe photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull.\\nShe was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out.\\nWhen I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since.\\nI rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house.\\nI hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait.\\nA little over-precipitance may ruin all.\"\\n\"And now?\"\\nI asked.\\n\"Our quest is practically finished.\\nI shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us.\\nWe will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph.\\nIt might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\"\\n\"And when will you call?\"\\n\"At eight in the morning.\\nShe will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field.\\nBesides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits.\\nI must wire to the King without delay.\"\\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door.\\nHe was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:  \"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\"\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n\"I\\'ve heard that voice before.\"\\nsaid Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street.\\n\"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\"\\nIII.\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\n\"You have really got it.\"\\nhe cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\n\"Not yet.\"\\n\"But you have hopes?\"\\n\"I have hopes.\"\\n\"Then, come.\\nI am all impatience to be gone.\"\\n\"We must have a cab.\"\\n\"No, my brougham is waiting.\"\\n\"Then that will simplify matters.\"\\nWe descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.\\n\"Irene Adler is married.\"\\nremarked Holmes.\\n\"Married!\\nWhen?\"\\n\"Yesterday.\"\\n\"But to whom?\"\\n\"To an English lawyer named Norton.\"\\n\"But she could not love him.\"\\n\"I am in hopes that she does.\"\\n\"And why in hopes?\"\\n\"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance.\\nIf the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty.\\nIf she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty\\'s plan.\"\\n\"It is true.\\nAnd yet--Well!\\nI wish she had been of my own station!\\nWhat a queen she would have made.\"\\nHe relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.\\nShe watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.\\n\"Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes, I believe?\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"I am Mr.\\nHolmes.\"\\nanswered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.\\n\"Indeed!\\nMy mistress told me that you were likely to call.\\nShe left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.\"\\n\"What.\"\\nSherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise.\\n\"Do you mean that she has left England?\"\\n\"Never to return.\"\\n\"And the papers?\"\\nasked the King hoarsely.\\n\"All is lost.\"\\n\"We shall see.\"\\nHe pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself.\\nThe furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\\nHolmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.\\nThe photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to \"Sherlock Holmes, Esq.\\nTo be left till called for.\"\\nMy friend tore it open and we all three read it together.\\nIt was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:  \"MY DEAR MR.\\nSHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well.\\nYou took me in completely.\\nUntil after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion.\\nBut then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think.\\nI had been warned against you months ago.\\nI had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you.\\nAnd your address had been given me.\\nYet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know.\\nEven after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.\\nBut, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\\nMale costume is nothing new to me.\\nI often take advantage of the freedom which it gives.\\nI sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.\\n\"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes.\\nThen I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.\\n\"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow.\\nAs to the photograph, your client may rest in peace.\\nI love and am loved by a better man than he.\\nThe King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged.\\nI keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future.\\nI leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes,                                        \"Very truly yours,                                    \"IRENE NORTON, née ADLER.\"\\n\"What a woman--oh, what a woman.\"\\ncried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle.\\n\"Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?\\nWould she not have made an admirable queen?\\nIs it not a pity that she was not on my level?\"\\n\"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty.\"\\nsaid Holmes coldly.\\n\"I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\\'s business to a more successful conclusion.\"\\n\"On the contrary, my dear sir.\"\\ncried the King; \"nothing could be more successful.\\nI know that her word is inviolate.\\nThe photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\"\\n\"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\"\\n\"I am immensely indebted to you.\\nPray tell me in what way I can reward you.\\nThis ring-.\"\\nHe slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n\"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"You have but to name it.\"\\n\"This photograph.\"\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\n\"Irene\\'s photograph.\"\\nhe cried.\\n\"Certainly, if you wish it.\"\\n\"I thank your Majesty.\\nThen there is no more to be done in the matter.\\nI have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.\"\\nHe bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\\'s wit.\\nHe used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late.\\nAnd when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\\nADVENTURE II.\\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE  I had called upon my friend, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.\\nWith an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\n\"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson.\"\\nhe said cordially.\\n\"I was afraid that you were engaged.\"\\n\"So I am.\\nVery much so.\"\\n\"Then I can wait in the next room.\"\\n\"Not at all.\\nThis gentleman, Mr.\\nWilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\"\\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.\\n\"Try the settee.\"\\nsaid Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods.\\n\"I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life.\\nYou have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\"\\n\"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me.\"\\nI observed.\\n\"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\"\\n\"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\"\\n\"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right.\\nNow, Mr.\\nJabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time.\\nYou have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\\nAs far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\\nPerhaps, Mr.\\nWilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative.\\nI ask you not merely because my friend Dr.\\nWatson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.\\nAs a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory.\\nIn the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\"\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat.\\nAs he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection.\\nOur visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow.\\nHe wore rather baggy grey shepherd\\'s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament.\\nA frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.\\nAltogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\\nSherlock Holmes\\' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.\\n\"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\"\\nMr.\\nJabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\n\"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.\\nHolmes?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.\\nIt\\'s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\\'s carpenter.\"\\n\"Your hands, my dear sir.\\nYour right hand is quite a size larger than your left.\\nYou have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\"\\n\"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\"\\n\"I won\\'t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.\"\\n\"Ah, of course, I forgot that.\\nBut the writing?\"\\n\"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?\"\\n\"Well, but China?\"\\n\"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China.\\nI have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.\\nThat trick of staining the fishes\\' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.\\nWhen, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\"\\nMr.\\nJabez Wilson laughed heavily.\\n\"Well, I never.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all.\"\\n\"I begin to think, Watson.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"that I make a mistake in explaining.\\n\\'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\\' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid.\\nCan you not find the advertisement, Mr.\\nWilson?\"\\n\"Yes, I have got it now.\"\\nhe answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column.\\n\"Here it is.\\nThis is what began it all.\\nYou just read it for yourself, sir.\"\\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:  \"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.\\nS.\\nA., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services.\\nAll red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.\\nApply in person on Monday, at eleven o\\'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope\\'s Court, Fleet Street.\"\\n\"What on earth does this mean?\"\\nI ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.\\nHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits.\\n\"It is a little off the beaten track, isn\\'t it?\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"And now, Mr.\\nWilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes.\\nYou will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.\"\\n\"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890.\\nJust two months ago.\"\\n\"Very good.\\nNow, Mr.\\nWilson?\"\\n\"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes.\"\\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \"I have a small pawnbroker\\'s business at Coburg Square, near the City.\\nIt\\'s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living.\\nI used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.\"\\n\"What is the name of this obliging youth?\"\\nasked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\\'s not such a youth, either.\\nIt\\'s hard to say his age.\\nI should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr.\\nHolmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him.\\nBut, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\"\\n\"Why, indeed?\\nYou seem most fortunate in having an employé who comes under the full market price.\\nIt is not a common experience among employers in this age.\\nI don\\'t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.\"\\n\"Oh, he has his faults, too.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nWilson.\\n\"Never was such a fellow for photography.\\nSnapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures.\\nThat is his main fault, but on the whole he\\'s a good worker.\\nThere\\'s no vice in him.\"\\n\"He is still with you, I presume?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\\nHe and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that\\'s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family.\\nWe live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.\\n\"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.\\nSpaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:  \"\\'I wish to the Lord, Mr.\\nWilson, that I was a red-headed man.\\'\\n\"\\'Why that?\\' I asks.\\n\"\\'Why,\\' says he, \\'here\\'s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men.\\nIt\\'s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\\' end what to do with the money.\\nIf my hair would only change colour, here\\'s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\\'\\n\"\\'Why, what is it, then?\\' I asked.\\nYou see, Mr.\\nHolmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat.\\nIn that way I didn\\'t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.\\n\"\\'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\\' he asked with his eyes open.\\n\"\\'Never.\\'\\n\"\\'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.\\'\\n\"\\'And what are they worth?\\' I asked.\\n\"\\'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\\'s other occupations.\\'\\n\"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.\\n\"\\'Tell me all about it,\\' said I.\\n\"\\'Well,\\' said he, showing me the advertisement, \\'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars.\\nAs far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways.\\nHe was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour.\\nFrom all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\\'\\n\"\\'But,\\' said I, \\'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\\'\\n\"\\'Not so many as you might think,\\' he answered.\\n\\'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men.\\nThis American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red.\\nNow, if you cared to apply, Mr.\\nWilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\\'\\n\"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met.\\nVincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.\\nHe was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\\n\"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nFrom north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.\\nFleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\\'s Court looked like a coster\\'s orange barrow.\\nI should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement.\\nEvery shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint.\\nWhen I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it.\\nHow he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office.\\nThere was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\"\\n\"Your experience has been a most entertaining one.\"\\nremarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\\n\"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\"\\n\"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine.\\nHe said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them.\\nGetting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all.\\nHowever, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\n\"\\'This is Mr.\\nJabez Wilson,\\' said my assistant, \\'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.\\'\\n\"\\'And he is admirably suited for it,\\' the other answered.\\n\\'He has every requirement.\\nI cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\\' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful.\\nThen suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\n\"\\'It would be injustice to hesitate,\\' said he.\\n\\'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\\' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.\\n\\'There is water in your eyes,\\' said he as he released me.\\n\\'I perceive that all is as it should be.\\nBut we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.\\nI could tell you tales of cobbler\\'s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\\' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled.\\nA groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\n\"\\'My name,\\' said he, \\'is Mr.\\nDuncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor.\\nAre you a married man, Mr.\\nWilson?\\nHave you a family?\\'\\n\"I answered that I had not.\\n\"His face fell immediately.\\n\"\\'Dear me!\\' he said gravely, \\'that is very serious indeed!\\nI am sorry to hear you say that.\\nThe fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance.\\nIt is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\\'\\n\"My face lengthened at this, Mr.\\nHolmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.\\n\"\\'In the case of another,\\' said he, \\'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours.\\nWhen shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\\'\\n\"\\'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\\' said I.\\n\"\\'Oh, never mind about that, Mr.\\nWilson!\\' said Vincent Spaulding.\\n\\'I should be able to look after that for you.\\'\\n\"\\'What would be the hours?\\' I asked.\\n\"\\'Ten to two.\\'\\n\"Now a pawnbroker\\'s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.\\nHolmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.\\nBesides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.\\n\"\\'That would suit me very well,\\' said I.\\n\\'And the pay?\\'\\n\"\\'Is 4 pounds a week.\\'\\n\"\\'And the work?\\'\\n\"\\'Is purely nominal.\\'\\n\"\\'What do you call purely nominal?\\'\\n\"\\'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time.\\nIf you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.\\nThe will is very clear upon that point.\\nYou don\\'t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.\\'\\n\"\\'It\\'s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\\' said I.\\n\"\\'No excuse will avail,\\' said Mr.\\nDuncan Ross; \\'neither sickness nor business nor anything else.\\nThere you must stay, or you lose your billet.\\'\\n\"\\'And the work?\\'\\n\"\\'Is to copy out the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica.\"\\nThere is the first volume of it in that press.\\nYou must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair.\\nWill you be ready to-morrow?\\'\\n\"\\'Certainly,\\' I answered.\\n\"\\'Then, good-bye, Mr.\\nJabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.\\' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.\\n\"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine.\\nIt seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the \\'Encyclopaedia Britannica.\\' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing.\\nHowever, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope\\'s Court.\\n\"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr.\\nDuncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work.\\nHe started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me.\\nAt two o\\'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.\\n\"This went on day after day, Mr.\\nHolmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\\'s work.\\nIt was the same next week, and the same the week after.\\nEvery morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two.\\nBy degrees Mr.\\nDuncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all.\\nStill, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.\\n\"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B\\'s before very long.\\nIt cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.\\nAnd then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\"\\n\"To an end?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\\nAnd no later than this morning.\\nI went to my work as usual at ten o\\'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack.\\nHere it is, and you can read for yourself.\"\\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper.\\nIt read in this fashion:                    THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE                             IS                          DISSOLVED.\\nOctober 9, 1890.\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.\\n\"I cannot see that there is anything very funny.\"\\ncried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head.\\n\"If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\"\\n\"No, no.\"\\ncried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen.\\n\"I really wouldn\\'t miss your case for the world.\\nIt is most refreshingly unusual.\\nBut there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.\\nPray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?\"\\n\"I was staggered, sir.\\nI did not know what to do.\\nThen I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.\\nFinally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League.\\nHe said that he had never heard of any such body.\\nThen I asked him who Mr.\\nDuncan Ross was.\\nHe answered that the name was new to him.\\n\"\\'Well,\\' said I, \\'the gentleman at No.\\n4.\\'\\n\"\\'What, the red-headed man?\\'\\n\"\\'Yes.\\'\\n\"\\'Oh,\\' said he, \\'his name was William Morris.\\nHe was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready.\\nHe moved out yesterday.\\'\\n\"\\'Where could I find him?\\'\\n\"\\'Oh, at his new offices.\\nHe did tell me the address.\\nYes, 17 King Edward Street, near St.\\nPaul\\'s.\\'\\n\"I started off, Mr.\\nHolmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr.\\nWilliam Morris or Mr.\\nDuncan Ross.\"\\n\"And what did you do then?\"\\nasked Holmes.\\n\"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant.\\nBut he could not help me in any way.\\nHe could only say that if I waited I should hear by post.\\nBut that was not quite good enough, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nI did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.\"\\n\"And you did very wisely.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.\\nFrom what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\"\\n\"Grave enough.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nJabez Wilson.\\n\"Why, I have lost four pound a week.\"\\n\"As far as you are personally concerned.\"\\nremarked Holmes, \"I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league.\\nOn the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A.\\nYou have lost nothing by them.\"\\n\"No, sir.\\nBut I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me.\\nIt was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.\"\\n\"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you.\\nAnd, first, one or two questions, Mr.\\nWilson.\\nThis assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?\"\\n\"About a month then.\"\\n\"How did he come?\"\\n\"In answer to an advertisement.\"\\n\"Was he the only applicant?\"\\n\"No, I had a dozen.\"\\n\"Why did you pick him?\"\\n\"Because he was handy and would come cheap.\"\\n\"At half-wages, in fact.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\"\\n\"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he\\'s not short of thirty.\\nHas a white splash of acid upon his forehead.\"\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement.\\n\"I thought as much.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\\nHe told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.\"\\n\"Hum.\"\\nsaid Holmes, sinking back in deep thought.\\n\"He is still with you?\"\\n\"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\"\\n\"And has your business been attended to in your absence?\"\\n\"Nothing to complain of, sir.\\nThere\\'s never very much to do of a morning.\"\\n\"That will do, Mr.\\nWilson.\\nI shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two.\\nTo-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\"\\n\"Well, Watson.\"\\nsaid Holmes when our visitor had left us, \"what do you make of it all?\"\\n\"I make nothing of it.\"\\nI answered frankly.\\n\"It is a most mysterious business.\"\\n\"As a rule.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be.\\nIt is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify.\\nBut I must be prompt over this matter.\"\\n\"What are you going to do, then?\"\\nI asked.\\n\"To smoke.\"\\nhe answered.\\n\"It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won\\'t speak to me for fifty minutes.\"\\nHe curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.\\nI had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\\n\"Sarasate plays at the St.\\nJames\\'s Hall this afternoon.\"\\nhe remarked.\\n\"What do you think, Watson?\\nCould your patients spare you for a few hours?\"\\n\"I have nothing to do to-day.\\nMy practice is never very absorbing.\"\\n\"Then put on your hat and come.\\nI am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way.\\nI observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French.\\nIt is introspective, and I want to introspect.\\nCome along.\"\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning.\\nIt was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere.\\nThree gilt balls and a brown board with \"JABEZ WILSO.\"\\nin white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.\\nSherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids.\\nThen he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses.\\nFinally he returned to the pawnbroker\\'s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.\\nIt was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\\n\"Thank you.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.\"\\n\"Third right, fourth left.\"\\nanswered the assistant promptly, closing the door.\\n\"Smart fellow, that.\"\\nobserved Holmes as we walked away.\\n\"He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third.\\nI have known something of him before.\"\\n\"Evidently.\"\\nsaid I, \"Mr.\\nWilson\\'s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League.\\nI am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\"\\n\"Not him.\"\\n\"What then?\"\\n\"The knees of his trousers.\"\\n\"And what did you see?\"\\n\"What I expected to see.\"\\n\"Why did you beat the pavement?\"\\n\"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.\\nWe are spies in an enemy\\'s country.\\nWe know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\\nLet us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\"\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back.\\nIt was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.\\nThe roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians.\\nIt was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.\\n\"Let me see.\"\\nsaid Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \"I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\\nIt is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.\\nThere is Mortimer\\'s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\\'s carriage-building depot.\\nThat carries us right on to the other block.\\nAnd now, Doctor, we\\'ve done our work, so it\\'s time we had some play.\\nA sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\"\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit.\\nAll the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive.\\nIn his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him.\\nThe swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\\nThen it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals.\\nWhen I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.\\nJames\\'s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.\\n\"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor.\"\\nhe remarked as we emerged.\\n\"Yes, it would be as well.\"\\n\"And I have some business to do which will take some hours.\\nThis business at Coburg Square is serious.\"\\n\"Why serious?\"\\n\"A considerable crime is in contemplation.\\nI have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it.\\nBut to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters.\\nI shall want your help to-night.\"\\n\"At what time?\"\\n\"Ten will be early enough.\"\\n\"I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\"\\n\"Very well.\\nAnd, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\"\\nHe waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.\\nHere I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.\\nAs I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the \"Encyclopaedi.\"\\ndown to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.\\nWhat was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do?\\nI had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\\'s assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game.\\nI tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.\\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.\\nTwo hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above.\\nOn entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.\\n\"Ha!\\nOur party is complete.\"\\nsaid Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.\\n\"Watson, I think you know Mr.\\nJones, of Scotland Yard?\\nLet me introduce you to Mr.\\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\\'s adventure.\"\\n\"We\\'re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see.\"\\nsaid Jones in his consequential way.\\n\"Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase.\\nAll he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\"\\n\"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase.\"\\nobserved Mr.\\nMerryweather gloomily.\\n\"You may place considerable confidence in Mr.\\nHolmes, sir.\"\\nsaid the police agent loftily.\\n\"He has his own little methods, which are, if he won\\'t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him.\\nIt is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\"\\n\"Oh, if you say so, Mr.\\nJones, it is all right.\"\\nsaid the stranger with deference.\\n\"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.\\nIt is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.\"\\n\"I think you will find.\"\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes, \"that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting.\\nFor you, Mr.\\nMerryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\"\\n\"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger.\\nHe\\'s a young man, Mr.\\nMerryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.\\nHe\\'s a remarkable man, is young John Clay.\\nHis grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford.\\nHis brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself.\\nHe\\'ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\nI\\'ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\"\\n\"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.\\nI\\'ve had one or two little turns also with Mr.\\nJohn Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession.\\nIt is past ten, however, and quite time that we started.\\nIf you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\"\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon.\\nWe rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.\\n\"We are close there now.\"\\nmy friend remarked.\\n\"This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter.\\nI thought it as well to have Jones with us also.\\nHe is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.\\nHe has one positive virtue.\\nHe is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.\\nHere we are, and they are waiting for us.\"\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning.\\nOur cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr.\\nMerryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.\\nWithin there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate.\\nThis also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate.\\nMr.\\nMerryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\n\"You are not very vulnerable from above.\"\\nHolmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.\\n\"Nor from below.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nMerryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor.\\n\"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow.\"\\nhe remarked, looking up in surprise.\\n\"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet.\"\\nsaid Holmes severely.\\n\"You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition.\\nMight I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\"\\nThe solemn Mr.\\nMerryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones.\\nA few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\\n\"We have at least an hour before us.\"\\nhe remarked, \"for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.\\nThen they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape.\\nWe are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks.\\nMr.\\nMerryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.\"\\n\"It is our French gold.\"\\nwhispered the director.\\n\"We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\"\\n\"Your French gold?\"\\n\"Yes.\\nWe had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.\\nIt has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar.\\nThe crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil.\\nOur reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\"\\n\"Which were very well justified.\"\\nobserved Holmes.\\n\"And now it is time that we arranged our little plans.\\nI expect that within an hour matters will come to a head.\\nIn the meantime Mr.\\nMerryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\"\\n\"And sit in the dark?\"\\n\"I am afraid so.\\nI had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all.\\nBut I see that the enemy\\'s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light.\\nAnd, first of all, we must choose our positions.\\nThese are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\\nI shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those.\\nThen, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly.\\nIf they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\"\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched.\\nHolmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced.\\nThe smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\\'s notice.\\nTo me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\\n\"They have but one retreat.\"\\nwhispered Holmes.\\n\"That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square.\\nI hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?\"\\n\"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\"\\n\"Then we have stopped all the holes.\\nAnd now we must be silent and wait.\"\\nWhat a time it seemed!\\nFrom comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us.\\nMy limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.\\nFrom my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor.\\nSuddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement.\\nThen it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light.\\nFor a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor.\\nThen it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary.\\nWith a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern.\\nOver the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge.\\nIn another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n\"It\\'s all clear.\"\\nhe whispered.\\n\"Have you the chisel and the bags?\\nGreat Scott!\\nJump, Archie, jump, and I\\'ll swing for it.\"\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\\nThe other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts.\\nThe light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes\\' hunting crop came down on the man\\'s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\n\"It\\'s no use, John Clay.\"\\nsaid Holmes blandly.\\n\"You have no chance at all.\"\\n\"So I see.\"\\nthe other answered with the utmost coolness.\\n\"I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\"\\n\"There are three men waiting for him at the door.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Oh, indeed!\\nYou seem to have done the thing very completely.\\nI must compliment you.\"\\n\"And I you.\"\\nHolmes answered.\\n\"Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.\"\\n\"You\\'ll see your pal again presently.\"\\nsaid Jones.\\n\"He\\'s quicker at climbing down holes than I am.\\nJust hold out while I fix the derbies.\"\\n\"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands.\"\\nremarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.\\n\"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins.\\nHave the goodness, also, when you address me always to say \\'sir\\' and \\'please..\"\\n\"All right.\"\\nsaid Jones with a stare and a snigger.\\n\"Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?\"\\n\"That is better.\"\\nsaid John Clay serenely.\\nHe made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\n\"Really, Mr.\\nHolmes.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nMerryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \"I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\nThere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\"\\n\"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.\\nJohn Clay.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\"\\n\"You see, Watson.\"\\nhe explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \"it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the \\'Encyclopaedia,\\' must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day.\\nIt was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.\\nThe method was no doubt suggested to Clay\\'s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\\'s hair.\\nThe 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?\\nThey put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week.\\nFrom the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\"\\n\"But how could you guess what the motive was?\"\\n\"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue.\\nThat, however, was out of the question.\\nThe man\\'s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at.\\nIt must, then, be something out of the house.\\nWhat could it be?\\nI thought of the assistant\\'s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar.\\nThe cellar!\\nThere was the end of this tangled clue.\\nThen I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London.\\nHe was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end.\\nWhat could it be, once more?\\nI could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.\\n\"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action.\\nI surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick.\\nI was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.\\nIt was not in front.\\nThen I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it.\\nWe have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before.\\nI hardly looked at his face.\\nHis knees were what I wished to see.\\nYou must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were.\\nThey spoke of those hours of burrowing.\\nThe only remaining point was what they were burrowing for.\\nI walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend\\'s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.\\nWhen you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\"\\n\"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\"\\nI asked.\\n\"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr.\\nJabez Wilson\\'s presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel.\\nBut it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed.\\nSaturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.\\nFor all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\"\\n\"You reasoned it out beautifully.\"\\nI exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.\\n\"It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\"\\n\"It saved me from ennui.\"\\nhe answered, yawning.\\n\"Alas!\\nI already feel it closing in upon me.\\nMy life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.\\nThese little problems help me to do so.\"\\n\"And you are a benefactor of the race.\"\\nsaid I.\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use.\"\\nhe remarked.\\n\"\\'L\\'homme c\\'est rien--l\\'oeuvre c\\'est tout,\\' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\"\\nADVENTURE III.\\nA CASE OF IDENTITY  \"My dear fellow.\"\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \"life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent.\\nWe would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.\\nIf we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.\"\\n\"And yet I am not convinced of it.\"\\nI answered.\\n\"The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.\\nWe have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.\"\\n\"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect.\"\\nremarked Holmes.\\n\"This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter.\\nDepend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\"\\nI smiled and shook my head.\\n\"I can quite understand your thinking so.\"\\nI said.\\n\"Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre.\\nBut here\"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--\"let us put it to a practical test.\\nHere is the first heading upon which I come.\\n\\'A husband\\'s cruelty to his wife.\\' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me.\\nThere is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady.\\nThe crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\"\\n\"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument.\"\\nsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it.\\n\"This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it.\\nThe husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller.\\nTake a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\"\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid.\\nIts splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\\n\"Ah.\"\\nsaid he, \"I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.\\nIt is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\"\\n\"And the ring?\"\\nI asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.\\n\"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.\"\\n\"And have you any on hand just now?\"\\nI asked with interest.\\n\"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\\nThey are important, you understand, without being interesting.\\nIndeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation.\\nThe larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive.\\nIn these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest.\\nIt is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\"\\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.\\nLooking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear.\\nFrom under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons.\\nSuddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\\n\"I have seen those symptoms before.\"\\nsaid Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire.\\n\"Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur.\\nShe would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication.\\nAnd yet even here we may discriminate.\\nWhen a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire.\\nHere we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved.\\nBut here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\"\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat.\\nSherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\\n\"Do you not find.\"\\nhe said, \"that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?\"\\n\"I did at first.\"\\nshe answered, \"but now I know where the letters are without looking.\"\\nThen, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face.\\n\"You\\'ve heard about me, Mr.\\nHolmes.\"\\nshe cried, \"else how could you know all that?\"\\n\"Never mind.\"\\nsaid Holmes, laughing; \"it is my business to know things.\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook.\\nIf not, why should you come to consult me?\"\\n\"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs.\\nEtherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead.\\nOh, Mr.\\nHolmes, I wish you would do as much for me.\\nI\\'m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr.\\nHosmer Angel.\"\\n\"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\"\\nasked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\n\"Yes, I did bang out of the house.\"\\nshe said, \"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.\\nWindibank--that is, my father--took it all.\\nHe would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.\"\\n\"Your father.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"your stepfather, surely, since the name is different.\"\\n\"Yes, my stepfather.\\nI call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\"\\n\"And your mother is alive?\"\\n\"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well.\\nI wasn\\'t best pleased, Mr.\\nHolmes, when she married again so soon after father\\'s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself.\\nFather was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr.\\nHardy, the foreman; but when Mr.\\nWindibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.\\nThey got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\\'t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\"\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\\n\"Your own little income.\"\\nhe asked, \"does it come out of the business?\"\\n\"Oh, no, sir.\\nIt is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland.\\nIt is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per cent.\\nTwo thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\"\\n\"You interest me extremely.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way.\\nI believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 pounds.\"\\n\"I could do with much less than that, Mr.\\nHolmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don\\'t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them.\\nOf course, that is only just for the time.\\nMr.\\nWindibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting.\\nIt brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\"\\n\"You have made your position very clear to me.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"This is my friend, Dr.\\nWatson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.\\nKindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr.\\nHosmer Angel.\"\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\\'s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket.\\n\"I met him first at the gasfitters\\' ball.\"\\nshe said.\\n\"They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother.\\nMr.\\nWindibank did not wish us to go.\\nHe never did wish us to go anywhere.\\nHe would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat.\\nBut this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent?\\nHe said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father\\'s friends were to be there.\\nAnd he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer.\\nAt last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr.\\nHardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.\\nHosmer Angel.\"\\n\"I suppose.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"that when Mr.\\nWindibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\"\\n\"Oh, well, he was very good about it.\\nHe laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.\"\\n\"I see.\\nThen at the gasfitters\\' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr.\\nHosmer Angel.\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\\nI met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr.\\nHolmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr.\\nHosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\"\\n\"No?\"\\n\"Well, you know father didn\\'t like anything of the sort.\\nHe wouldn\\'t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle.\\nBut then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.\"\\n\"But how about Mr.\\nHosmer Angel?\\nDid he make no attempt to see you?\"\\n\"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone.\\nWe could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day.\\nI took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.\"\\n\"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\"\\n\"Oh, yes, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nWe were engaged after the first walk that we took.\\nHosmer--Mr.\\nAngel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and-.\"\\n\"What office?\"\\n\"That\\'s the worst of it, Mr.\\nHolmes, I don\\'t know.\"\\n\"Where did he live, then?\"\\n\"He slept on the premises.\"\\n\"And you don\\'t know his address?\"\\n\"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street.\"\\n\"Where did you address your letters, then?\"\\n\"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for.\\nHe said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\\'t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us.\\nThat will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr.\\nHolmes, and the little things that he would think of.\"\\n\"It was most suggestive.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.\\nCan you remember any other little things about Mr.\\nHosmer Angel?\"\\n\"He was a very shy man, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nHe would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous.\\nVery retiring and gentlemanly he was.\\nEven his voice was gentle.\\nHe\\'d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech.\\nHe was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\"\\n\"Well, and what happened when Mr.\\nWindibank, your stepfather, returned to France?\"\\n\"Mr.\\nHosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back.\\nHe was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him.\\nMother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.\\nMother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was.\\nThen, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him.\\nI didn\\'t quite like that, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nIt seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\\'t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.\"\\n\"It missed him, then?\"\\n\"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\"\\n\"Ha!\\nthat was unfortunate.\\nYour wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday.\\nWas it to be in church?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, but very quietly.\\nIt was to be at St.\\nSaviour\\'s, near King\\'s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.\\nPancras Hotel.\\nHosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street.\\nWe got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there!\\nThe cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes.\\nThat was last Friday, Mr.\\nHolmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\"\\n\"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Oh, no, sir!\\nHe was too good and kind to leave me so.\\nWhy, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later.\\nIt seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\"\\n\"Most certainly it does.\\nYour own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\\nI believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so.\\nAnd then I think that what he foresaw happened.\"\\n\"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?\"\\n\"None.\"\\n\"One more question.\\nHow did your mother take the matter?\"\\n\"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\"\\n\"And your father?\\nDid you tell him?\"\\n\"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again.\\nAs he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me?\\nNow, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine.\\nAnd yet, what could have happened?\\nAnd why could he not write?\\nOh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\\'t sleep a wink at night.\"\\nShe pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\\n\"I shall glance into the case for you.\"\\nsaid Holmes, rising, \"and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result.\\nLet the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further.\\nAbove all, try to let Mr.\\nHosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\"\\n\"Then you don\\'t think I\\'ll see him again?\"\\n\"I fear not.\"\\n\"Then what has happened to him?\"\\n\"You will leave that question in my hands.\\nI should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\"\\n\"I advertised for him in last Saturday\\'s Chronicle.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.\"\\n\"Thank you.\\nAnd your address?\"\\n\"No.\\n31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nAngel\\'s address you never had, I understand.\\nWhere is your father\\'s place of business?\"\\n\"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.\"\\n\"Thank you.\\nYou have made your statement very clearly.\\nYou will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you.\\nLet the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.\"\\n\"You are very kind, Mr.\\nHolmes, but I cannot do that.\\nI shall be true to Hosmer.\\nHe shall find me ready when he comes back.\"\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.\\nShe laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling.\\nThen he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\\n\"Quite an interesting study, that maiden.\"\\nhe observed.\\n\"I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one.\\nYou will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in \\'77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year.\\nOld as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me.\\nBut the maiden herself was most instructive.\"\\n\"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me.\"\\nI remarked.\\n\"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson.\\nYou did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important.\\nI can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.\\nNow, what did you gather from that woman\\'s appearance?\\nDescribe it.\"\\n\"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red.\\nHer jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments.\\nHer dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves.\\nHer gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger.\\nHer boots I didn\\'t observe.\\nShe had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\"\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n\"\\'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully.\\nYou have really done very well indeed.\\nIt is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour.\\nNever trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details.\\nMy first glance is always at a woman\\'s sleeve.\\nIn a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser.\\nAs you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces.\\nThe double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined.\\nThe sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was.\\nI then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\"\\n\"It surprised me.\"\\n\"But, surely, it was obvious.\\nI was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one.\\nOne was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth.\\nNow, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\"\\n\"And what else?\"\\nI asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend\\'s incisive reasoning.\\n\"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed.\\nYou observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink.\\nShe had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep.\\nIt must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.\\nAll this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson.\\nWould you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr.\\nHosmer Angel?\"\\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\\n\"Missing.\"\\nit said, \"on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel.\\nAbout five ft.\\nseven in.\\nin height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech.\\nWas dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots.\\nKnown to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street.\\nAnybody bringing-.\"\\n\"That will do.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"As to the letters.\"\\nhe continued, glancing over them, \"they are very commonplace.\\nAbsolutely no clue in them to Mr.\\nAngel, save that he quotes Balzac once.\\nThere is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\"\\n\"They are typewritten.\"\\nI remarked.\\n\"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten.\\nLook at the neat little \\'Hosmer Angel\\' at the bottom.\\nThere is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague.\\nThe point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive.\"\\n\"Of what?\"\\n\"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?\"\\n\"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\"\\n\"No, that was not the point.\\nHowever, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter.\\nOne is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady\\'s stepfather, Mr.\\nWindibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o\\'clock tomorrow evening.\\nIt is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives.\\nAnd now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\"\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\\'s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom.\\nOnce only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer.\\nIt was not until close upon six o\\'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery.\\nI found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair.\\nA formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n\"Well, have you solved it?\"\\nI asked as I entered.\\n\"Yes.\\nIt was the bisulphate of baryta.\"\\n\"No, no, the mystery.\"\\nI cried.\\n\"Oh, that!\\nI thought of the salt that I have been working upon.\\nThere was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest.\\nThe only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\"\\n\"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?\"\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\\n\"This is the girl\\'s stepfather, Mr.\\nJames Windibank.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"He has written to me to say that he would be here at six.\\nCome in.\"\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes.\\nHe shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\\n\"Good-evening, Mr.\\nJames Windibank.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o\\'clock?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\\nI am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know.\\nI am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public.\\nIt was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point.\\nOf course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad.\\nBesides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\"\\n\"On the contrary.\"\\nsaid Holmes quietly; \"I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr.\\nHosmer Angel.\"\\nMr.\\nWindibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves.\\n\"I am delighted to hear it.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"It is a curious thing.\"\\nremarked Holmes, \"that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man\\'s handwriting.\\nUnless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike.\\nSome letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side.\\nNow, you remark in this note of yours, Mr.\\nWindibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the \\'e,\\' and a slight defect in the tail of the \\'r.\\' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.\"\\n\"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn.\"\\nour visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\\n\"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\\nWindibank.\"\\nHolmes continued.\\n\"I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime.\\nIt is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.\\nI have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.\\nThey are all typewritten.\\nIn each case, not only are the \\'e\\'s\\' slurred and the \\'r\\'s\\' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\"\\nMr.\\nWindibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat.\\n\"I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr.\\nHolmes.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\nsaid Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door.\\n\"I let you know, then, that I have caught him.\"\\n\"What!\\nwhere?\"\\nshouted Mr.\\nWindibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n\"Oh, it won\\'t do--really it won\\'t.\"\\nsaid Holmes suavely.\\n\"There is no possible getting out of it, Mr.\\nWindibank.\\nIt is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question.\\nThat\\'s right!\\nSit down and let us talk it over.\"\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow.\\n\"It--it\\'s not actionable.\"\\nhe stammered.\\n\"I am very much afraid that it is not.\\nBut between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me.\\nNow, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\"\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed.\\nHolmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n\"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money.\"\\nsaid he, \"and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them.\\nIt was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.\\nIt was worth an effort to preserve it.\\nThe daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long.\\nNow her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it?\\nHe takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age.\\nBut soon he found that that would not answer forever.\\nShe became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball.\\nWhat does her clever stepfather do then?\\nHe conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart.\\nWith the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl\\'s short sight, he appears as Mr.\\nHosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.\"\\n\"It was only a joke at first.\"\\ngroaned our visitor.\\n\"We never thought that she would have been so carried away.\"\\n\"Very likely not.\\nHowever that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind.\\nShe was flattered by the gentleman\\'s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother.\\nThen Mr.\\nAngel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced.\\nThere were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl\\'s affections from turning towards anyone else.\\nBut the deception could not be kept up forever.\\nThese pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous.\\nThe thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\\'s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come.\\nHence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding.\\nJames Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.\\nAs far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other.\\nI think that was the chain of events, Mr.\\nWindibank.\"\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\\n\"It may be so, or it may not, Mr.\\nHolmes.\"\\nsaid he, \"but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me.\\nI have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\"\\n\"The law cannot, as you say, touch you.\"\\nsaid Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, \"yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more.\\nIf the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders.\\nBy Jove.\"\\nhe continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\\'s face, \"it is not part of my duties to my client, but here\\'s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to-.\"\\nHe took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.\\nJames Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.\\n\"There\\'s a cold-blooded scoundrel.\"\\nsaid Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more.\\n\"That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\"\\n\"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning.\"\\nI remarked.\\n\"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.\\nHosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather.\\nThen the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive.\\nSo were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers.\\nMy suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it.\\nYou see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\"\\n\"And how did you verify them?\"\\n\"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration.\\nI knew the firm for which this man worked.\\nHaving taken the printed description.\\nI eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers.\\nI had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here.\\nAs I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects.\\nThe same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank.\\nVoilà tout.\"\\n\"And Miss Sutherland?\"\\n\"If I tell her she will not believe me.\\nYou may remember the old Persian saying, \\'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\\' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\"\\nADVENTURE IV.\\nTHE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY  We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram.\\nIt was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:  \"Have you a couple of days to spare?\\nHave just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.\\nShall be glad if you will come with me.\\nAir and scenery perfect.\\nLeave Paddington by the 11:15.\"\\n\"What do you say, dear?\"\\nsaid my wife, looking across at me.\\n\"Will you go?\"\\n\"I really don\\'t know what to say.\\nI have a fairly long list at present.\"\\n\"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you.\\nYou have been looking a little pale lately.\\nI think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes\\' cases.\"\\n\"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them.\"\\nI answered.\\n\"But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.\"\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller.\\nMy wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station.\\nSherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\n\"It is really very good of you to come, Watson.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.\\nLocal aid is always either worthless or else biassed.\\nIf you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\"\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him.\\nAmong these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading.\\nThen he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\\n\"Have you heard anything of the case?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"Not a word.\\nI have not seen a paper for some days.\"\\n\"The London press has not had very full accounts.\\nI have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars.\\nIt seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.\"\\n\"That sounds a little paradoxical.\"\\n\"But it is profoundly true.\\nSingularity is almost invariably a clue.\\nThe more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home.\\nIn this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.\"\\n\"It is a murder, then?\"\\n\"Well, it is conjectured to be so.\\nI shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it.\\nI will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.\\n\"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire.\\nThe largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr.\\nJohn Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country.\\nOne of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr.\\nCharles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian.\\nThe men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.\\nTurner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together.\\nMcCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living.\\nThey appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood.\\nMcCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.\\nTurner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least.\\nThat is as much as I have been able to gather about the families.\\nNow for the facts.\\n\"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley.\\nHe had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive.\\n\"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground.\\nOne was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr.\\nTurner.\\nBoth these witnesses depose that Mr.\\nMcCarthy was walking alone.\\nThe game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.\\nMcCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm.\\nTo the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him.\\nHe thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\n\"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them.\\nThe Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge.\\nA girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.\\nShe states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.\\nMcCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel.\\nShe heard Mr.\\nMcCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father.\\nShe was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight.\\nShe had hardly said the words when young Mr.\\nMcCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper.\\nHe was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood.\\nOn following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool.\\nThe head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon.\\nThe injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\\'s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body.\\nUnder these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of \\'wilful murder\\' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes.\\nThose are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.\"\\n\"I could hardly imagine a more damning case.\"\\nI remarked.\\n\"If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\"\\n\"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing.\"\\nanswered Holmes thoughtfully.\\n\"It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different.\\nIt must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit.\\nThere are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest.\\nLestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.\"\\n\"I am afraid.\"\\nsaid I, \"that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\"\\n\"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.\"\\nhe answered, laughing.\\n\"Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr.\\nLestrade.\\nYou know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding.\\nTo take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr.\\nLestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.\"\\n\"How on earth-.\"\\n\"My dear fellow, I know you well.\\nI know the military neatness which characterises you.\\nYou shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other.\\nI could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result.\\nI only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference.\\nTherein lies my métier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us.\\nThere are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\"\\n\"What are they?\"\\n\"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm.\\nOn the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.\\nThis observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner\\'s jury.\"\\n\"It was a confession.\"\\nI ejaculated.\\n\"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\"\\n\"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.\"\\n\"On the contrary.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds.\\nHowever innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him.\\nHad he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man.\\nHis frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness.\\nAs to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him.\\nThe self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.\"\\nI shook my head.\\n\"Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence.\"\\nI remarked.\\n\"So they have.\\nAnd many men have been wrongfully hanged.\"\\n\"What is the young man\\'s own account of the matter?\"\\n\"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.\\nYou will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\"\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred.\\nI settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully.\\nIt ran in this way:  \"Mr.\\nJames McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: \\'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd.\\nMy father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom.\\nShortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going.\\nI then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side.\\nOn my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father.\\nI had no idea that he was in front of me.\\nWhen about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of \"Cooee.\"\\nwhich was a usual signal between my father and myself.\\nI then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool.\\nHe appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there.\\nA conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper.\\nSeeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm.\\nI had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again.\\nI found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured.\\nI dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired.\\nI knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr.\\nTurner\\'s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance.\\nI saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries.\\nHe was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies.\\nI know nothing further of the matter.\\'\\n\"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n\"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.\\n\"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\n\"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me.\\nI thought that he was delirious.\\n\"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?\\n\"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\\n\"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\n\"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you.\\nI can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\n\"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide.\\nI need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.\\n\"Witness: I must still refuse.\\n\"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of \\'Cooee\\' was a common signal between you and your father?\\n\"Witness: It was.\\n\"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\n\"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\n\"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\n\"Witness: Nothing definite.\\n\"The Coroner: What do you mean?\\n\"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father.\\nYet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me.\\nIt seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.\\nWhen I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.\\n\"\\'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\\'\\n\"\\'Yes, it was gone.\\'\\n\"\\'You cannot say what it was?\\'\\n\"\\'No, I had a feeling something was there.\\'\\n\"\\'How far from the body?\\'\\n\"\\'A dozen yards or so.\\'\\n\"\\'And how far from the edge of the wood?\\'\\n\"\\'About the same.\\'\\n\"\\'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?\\'\\n\"\\'Yes, but with my back towards it.\\'\\n\"This concluded the examination of the witness.\"\\n\"I see.\"\\nsaid I as I glanced down the column, \"that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.\\nHe calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father\\'s dying words.\\nThey are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.\"\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat.\\n\"Both you and the coroner have been at some pains.\"\\nsaid he, \"to single out the very strongest points in the young man\\'s favour.\\nDon\\'t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little?\\nToo little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth.\\nNo, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us.\\nAnd now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action.\\nWe lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.\"\\nIt was nearly four o\\'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross.\\nA lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform.\\nIn spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard.\\nWith him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\\n\"I have ordered a carriage.\"\\nsaid Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.\\n\"I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\"\\n\"It was very nice and complimentary of you.\"\\nHolmes answered.\\n\"It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\"\\nLestrade looked startled.\\n\"I do not quite follow.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"How is the glass?\\nTwenty-nine, I see.\\nNo wind, and not a cloud in the sky.\\nI have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination.\\nI do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\"\\nLestrade laughed indulgently.\\n\"You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes.\\nStill, of course, one can\\'t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.\\nShe has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done.\\nWhy, bless my soul!\\nhere is her carriage at the door.\"\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life.\\nHer violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\\n\"Oh, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes.\"\\nshe cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman\\'s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, \"I am so glad that you have come.\\nI have driven down to tell you so.\\nI know that James didn\\'t do it.\\nI know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too.\\nNever let yourself doubt upon that point.\\nWe have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly.\\nSuch a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\"\\n\"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner.\"\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes.\\n\"You may rely upon my doing all that I can.\"\\n\"But you have read the evidence.\\nYou have formed some conclusion?\\nDo you not see some loophole, some flaw?\\nDo you not yourself think that he is innocent?\"\\n\"I think that it is very probable.\"\\n\"There, now.\"\\nshe cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade.\\n\"You hear!\\nHe gives me hopes.\"\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"But he is right.\\nOh!\\nI know that he is right.\\nJames never did it.\\nAnd about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.\"\\n\"In what way?\"\\nasked Holmes.\\n\"It is no time for me to hide anything.\\nJames and his father had many disagreements about me.\\nMr.\\nMcCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us.\\nJames and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet.\\nSo there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\"\\n\"And your father?\"\\nasked Holmes.\\n\"Was he in favour of such a union?\"\\n\"No, he was averse to it also.\\nNo one but Mr.\\nMcCarthy was in favour of it.\"\\nA quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\\n\"Thank you for this information.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"May I see your father if I call to-morrow?\"\\n\"I am afraid the doctor won\\'t allow it.\"\\n\"The doctor?\"\\n\"Yes, have you not heard?\\nPoor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely.\\nHe has taken to his bed, and Dr.\\nWillows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered.\\nMr.\\nMcCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\"\\n\"Ha!\\nIn Victoria!\\nThat is important.\"\\n\"Yes, at the mines.\"\\n\"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr.\\nTurner made his money.\"\\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\\n\"Thank you, Miss Turner.\\nYou have been of material assistance to me.\"\\n\"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow.\\nNo doubt you will go to the prison to see James.\\nOh, if you do, Mr.\\nHolmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.\"\\n\"I will, Miss Turner.\"\\n\"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him.\\nGood-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\"\\nShe hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\n\"I am ashamed of you, Holmes.\"\\nsaid Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes\\' silence.\\n\"Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint?\\nI am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\"\\n\"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Have you an order to see him in prison?\"\\n\"Yes, but only for you and me.\"\\n\"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out.\\nWe have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\"\\n\"Ample.\"\\n\"Then let us do so.\\nWatson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\"\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.\\nThe puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day.\\nSupposing that this unhappy young man\\'s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade?\\nIt was something terrible and deadly.\\nWhat could it be?\\nMight not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?\\nI rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.\\nIn the surgeon\\'s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon.\\nI marked the spot upon my own head.\\nClearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.\\nThat was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father.\\nStill, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell.\\nStill, it might be worth while to call Holmes\\' attention to it.\\nThen there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat.\\nWhat could that mean?\\nIt could not be delirium.\\nA man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious.\\nNo, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate.\\nBut what could it indicate?\\nI cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.\\nAnd then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy.\\nIf that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off.\\nWhat a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was!\\nI did not wonder at Lestrade\\'s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\\' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy\\'s innocence.\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned.\\nHe came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\n\"The glass still keeps very high.\"\\nhe remarked as he sat down.\\n\"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground.\\nOn the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey.\\nI have seen young McCarthy.\"\\n\"And what did you learn from him?\"\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\"Could he throw no light?\"\\n\"None at all.\\nI was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else.\\nHe is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\"\\n\"I cannot admire his taste.\"\\nI remarked, \"if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.\"\\n\"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale.\\nThis fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office?\\nNo one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible.\\nIt was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner.\\nOn the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth.\\nIt was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was.\\nMark that point.\\nIt is of importance.\\nGood has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them.\\nI think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.\"\\n\"But if he is innocent, who has done it?\"\\n\"Ah!\\nwho?\\nI would call your attention very particularly to two points.\\nOne is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return.\\nThe second is that the murdered man was heard to cry \\'Cooee!\\' before he knew that his son had returned.\\nThose are the crucial points upon which the case depends.\\nAnd now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.\"\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless.\\nAt nine o\\'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\n\"There is serious news this morning.\"\\nLestrade observed.\\n\"It is said that Mr.\\nTurner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\"\\n\"An elderly man, I presume?\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time.\\nThis business has had a very bad effect upon him.\\nHe was an old friend of McCarthy\\'s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\"\\n\"Indeed!\\nThat is interesting.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Oh, yes!\\nIn a hundred other ways he has helped him.\\nEverybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.\"\\n\"Really!\\nDoes it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner\\'s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow?\\nIt is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea.\\nThe daughter told us as much.\\nDo you not deduce something from that?\"\\n\"We have got to the deductions and the inferences.\"\\nsaid Lestrade, winking at me.\\n\"I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\"\\n\"You are right.\"\\nsaid Holmes demurely; \"you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.\"\\n\"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of.\"\\nreplied Lestrade with some warmth.\\n\"And that is-.\"\\n\"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\"\\n\"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog.\"\\nsaid Holmes, laughing.\\n\"But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\"\\n\"Yes, that is it.\"\\nIt was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls.\\nThe drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it.\\nWe called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\\' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son\\'s, though not the pair which he had then had.\\nHaving measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this.\\nMen who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him.\\nHis face flushed and darkened.\\nHis brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.\\nHis face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck.\\nHis nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply.\\nSwiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool.\\nIt was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side.\\nSometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow.\\nLestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr.\\nTurner.\\nAbove the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\\'s dwelling.\\nOn the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake.\\nLestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man.\\nTo Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass.\\nHe ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\\n\"What did you go into the pool for?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"I fished about with a rake.\\nI thought there might be some weapon or other trace.\\nBut how on earth-.\"\\n\"Oh, tut, tut!\\nI have no time!\\nThat left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place.\\nA mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds.\\nOh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it.\\nHere is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body.\\nBut here are three separate tracks of the same feet.\"\\nHe drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us.\\n\"These are young McCarthy\\'s feet.\\nTwice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible.\\nThat bears out his story.\\nHe ran when he saw his father on the ground.\\nThen here are the father\\'s feet as he paced up and down.\\nWhat is this, then?\\nIt is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening.\\nAnd this?\\nHa, ha!\\nWhat have we here?\\nTiptoes!\\ntiptoes!\\nSquare, too, quite unusual boots!\\nThey come, they go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak.\\nNow where did they come from?\"\\nHe ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood.\\nHolmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.\\nFor a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach.\\nA jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained.\\nThen he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\\n\"It has been a case of considerable interest.\"\\nhe remarked, returning to his natural manner.\\n\"I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge.\\nI think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note.\\nHaving done that, we may drive back to our luncheon.\\nYou may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\"\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.\\n\"This may interest you, Lestrade.\"\\nhe remarked, holding it out.\\n\"The murder was done with it.\"\\n\"I see no marks.\"\\n\"There are none.\"\\n\"How do you know, then?\"\\n\"The grass was growing under it.\\nIt had only lain there a few days.\\nThere was no sign of a place whence it had been taken.\\nIt corresponds with the injuries.\\nThere is no sign of any other weapon.\"\\n\"And the murderer?\"\\n\"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket.\\nThere are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.\"\\nLestrade laughed.\\n\"I am afraid that I am still a sceptic.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.\"\\n\"Nous verrons.\"\\nanswered Holmes calmly.\\n\"You work your own method, and I shall work mine.\\nI shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.\"\\n\"And leave your case unfinished?\"\\n\"No, finished.\"\\n\"But the mystery?\"\\n\"It is solved.\"\\n\"Who was the criminal, then?\"\\n\"The gentleman I describe.\"\\n\"But who is he?\"\\n\"Surely it would not be difficult to find out.\\nThis is not such a populous neighbourhood.\"\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"I am a practical man.\"\\nhe said, \"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg.\\nI should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\"\\n\"All right.\"\\nsaid Holmes quietly.\\n\"I have given you the chance.\\nHere are your lodgings.\\nGood-bye.\\nI shall drop you a line before I leave.\"\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table.\\nHolmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.\\n\"Look here, Watson.\"\\nhe said when the cloth was cleared \"just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little.\\nI don\\'t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice.\\nLight a cigar and let me expound.\"\\n\"Pray do so.\"\\n\"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy\\'s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him.\\nOne was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry \\'Cooee!\\' before seeing him.\\nThe other was his singular dying reference to a rat.\\nHe mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\\'s ear.\\nNow from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\"\\n\"What of this \\'Cooee!\\' then?\"\\n\"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son.\\nThe son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol.\\nIt was mere chance that he was within earshot.\\nThe \\'Cooee!\\' was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with.\\nBut \\'Cooee\\' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians.\\nThere is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\"\\n\"What of the rat, then?\"\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table.\\n\"This is a map of the Colony of Victoria.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"I wired to Bristol for it last night.\"\\nHe put his hand over part of the map.\\n\"What do you read?\"\\n\"ARAT.\"\\nI read.\\n\"And now?\"\\nHe raised his hand.\\n\"BALLARAT.\"\\n\"Quite so.\\nThat was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables.\\nHe was trying to utter the name of his murderer.\\nSo and so, of Ballarat.\"\\n\"It is wonderful.\"\\nI exclaimed.\\n\"It is obvious.\\nAnd now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably.\\nThe possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son\\'s statement to be correct, was a certainty.\\nWe have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.\"\\n\"Quite so.\"\\n\"Then comes our expedition of to-day.\\nBy an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\"\\n\"But how did you gain them?\"\\n\"You know my method.\\nIt is founded upon the observation of trifles.\"\\n\"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride.\\nHis boots, too, might be told from their traces.\"\\n\"Yes, they were peculiar boots.\"\\n\"But his lameness?\"\\n\"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left.\\nHe put less weight upon it.\\nWhy?\\nBecause he limped--he was lame.\"\\n\"But his left-handedness.\"\\n\"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest.\\nThe blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side.\\nNow, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man?\\nHe had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son.\\nHe had even smoked there.\\nI found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar.\\nI have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco.\\nHaving found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it.\\nIt was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.\"\\n\"And the cigar-holder?\"\\n\"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth.\\nTherefore he used a holder.\\nThe tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\"\\n\"Holmes.\"\\nI said, \"you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him.\\nI see the direction in which all this points.\\nThe culprit is-.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nJohn Turner.\"\\ncried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure.\\nHis slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character.\\nHis tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue.\\nIt was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\\n\"Pray sit down on the sofa.\"\\nsaid Holmes gently.\\n\"You had my note?\"\\n\"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up.\\nYou said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.\"\\n\"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\"\\n\"And why did you wish to see me?\"\\nHe looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsaid Holmes, answering the look rather than the words.\\n\"It is so.\\nI know all about McCarthy.\"\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands.\\n\"God help me.\"\\nhe cried.\\n\"But I would not have let the young man come to harm.\\nI give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\"\\n\"I am glad to hear you say so.\"\\nsaid Holmes gravely.\\n\"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl.\\nIt would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.\"\\n\"It may not come to that.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"What?\"\\n\"I am no official agent.\\nI understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.\\nYoung McCarthy must be got off, however.\"\\n\"I am a dying man.\"\\nsaid old Turner.\\n\"I have had diabetes for years.\\nMy doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month.\\nYet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\"\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him.\\n\"Just tell us the truth.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"I shall jot down the facts.\\nYou will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.\\nThen I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy.\\nI promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\"\\n\"It\\'s as well.\"\\nsaid the old man; \"it\\'s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock.\\nAnd now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\n\"You didn\\'t know this dead man, McCarthy.\\nHe was a devil incarnate.\\nI tell you that.\\nGod keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.\\nHis grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life.\\nI\\'ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\\n\"It was in the early \\'60\\'s at the diggings.\\nI was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.\\nThere were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.\\nBlack Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\n\"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it.\\nThere were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley.\\nThree of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag.\\nI put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy.\\nI wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature.\\nWe got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.\\nThere I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life.\\nI bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it.\\nI married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.\\nEven when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done.\\nIn a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past.\\nAll was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\\n\"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\n\"\\'Here we are, Jack,\\' says he, touching me on the arm; \\'we\\'ll be as good as a family to you.\\nThere\\'s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us.\\nIf you don\\'t--it\\'s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there\\'s always a policeman within hail.\\'\\n\"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.\\nThere was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow.\\nIt grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police.\\nWhatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give.\\nHe asked for Alice.\\n\"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property.\\nBut there I was firm.\\nI would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough.\\nI stood firm.\\nMcCarthy threatened.\\nI braved him to do his worst.\\nWe were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\\n\"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.\\nBut as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost.\\nHe was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets.\\nIt drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this.\\nCould I not snap the bond?\\nI was already a dying and a desperate man.\\nThough clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed.\\nBut my memory and my girl!\\nBoth could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue.\\nI did it, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nI would do it again.\\nDeeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it.\\nBut that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer.\\nI struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast.\\nHis cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight.\\nThat is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\"\\n\"Well, it is not for me to judge you.\"\\nsaid Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out.\\n\"I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.\"\\n\"I pray not, sir.\\nAnd what do you intend to do?\"\\n\"In view of your health, nothing.\\nYou are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes.\\nI will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it.\\nIf not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\"\\n\"Farewell, then.\"\\nsaid the old man solemnly.\\n\"Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.\"\\nTottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\\n\"God help us.\"\\nsaid Holmes after a long silence.\\n\"Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms?\\nI never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter\\'s words, and say, \\'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes..\"\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel.\\nOld Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.\\nADVENTURE V.\\nTHE FIVE ORANGE PIPS  When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years \\'82 and \\'90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave.\\nSome, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate.\\nSome, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him.\\nThere is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.\\nThe year \\'87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records.\\nAmong my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque \"Sophy Anderson\", of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case.\\nIn the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\\'s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case.\\nAll these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence.\\nAll day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage.\\nAs evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney.\\nSherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell\\'s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves.\\nMy wife was on a visit to her mother\\'s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.\\n\"Why.\"\\nsaid I, glancing up at my companion, \"that was surely the bell.\\nWho could come to-night?\\nSome friend of yours, perhaps?\"\\n\"Except yourself I have none.\"\\nhe answered.\\n\"I do not encourage visitors.\"\\n\"A client, then?\"\\n\"If so, it is a serious case.\\nNothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour.\\nBut I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady\\'s.\"\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door.\\nHe stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\\n\"Come in.\"\\nsaid he.\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing.\\nThe streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come.\\nHe looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\\n\"I owe you an apology.\"\\nhe said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes.\\n\"I trust that I am not intruding.\\nI fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\"\\n\"Give me your coat and umbrella.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently.\\nYou have come up from the south-west, I see.\"\\n\"Yes, from Horsham.\"\\n\"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.\"\\n\"I have come for advice.\"\\n\"That is easily got.\"\\n\"And help.\"\\n\"That is not always so easy.\"\\n\"I have heard of you, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nI heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\"\\n\"Ah, of course.\\nHe was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\"\\n\"He said that you could solve anything.\"\\n\"He said too much.\"\\n\"That you are never beaten.\"\\n\"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman.\"\\n\"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\"\\n\"It is true that I have been generally successful.\"\\n\"Then you may be so with me.\"\\n\"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case.\"\\n\"It is no ordinary one.\"\\n\"None of those which come to me are.\\nI am the last court of appeal.\"\\n\"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.\"\\n\"You fill me with interest.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.\"\\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.\\n\"My name.\"\\nsaid he, \"is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business.\\nIt is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.\\n\"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph.\\nMy father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling.\\nHe was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.\\n\"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well.\\nAt the time of the war he fought in Jackson\\'s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel.\\nWhen Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years.\\nAbout 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.\\nHe had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them.\\nHe was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition.\\nDuring all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town.\\nHe had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room.\\nHe drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\\n\"He didn\\'t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so.\\nThis would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England.\\nHe begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way.\\nWhen he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house.\\nI kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy.\\nThere was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter.\\nWith a boy\\'s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.\\n\"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel\\'s plate.\\nIt was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort.\\n\\'From India!\\' said he as he took it up, \\'Pondicherry postmark!\\nWhat can this be?\\' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate.\\nI began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face.\\nHis lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, \\'K.\\nK.\\nK.!\\' he shrieked, and then, \\'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\\'\\n\"\\'What is it, uncle?\\' I cried.\\n\"\\'Death,\\' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror.\\nI took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated.\\nThere was nothing else save the five dried pips.\\nWhat could be the reason of his overpowering terror?\\nI left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\\n\"\\'They may do what they like, but I\\'ll checkmate them still,\\' said he with an oath.\\n\\'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\\'\\n\"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room.\\nThe fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it.\\nAs I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.\\n\"\\'I wish you, John,\\' said my uncle, \\'to witness my will.\\nI leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you.\\nIf you can enjoy it in peace, well and good!\\nIf you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy.\\nI am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can\\'t say what turn things are going to take.\\nKindly sign the paper where Mr.\\nFordham shows you.\\'\\n\"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.\\nThe singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it.\\nYet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives.\\nI could see a change in my uncle, however.\\nHe drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society.\\nMost of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil.\\nWhen these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul.\\nAt such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\\n\"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr.\\nHolmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back.\\nWe found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden.\\nThere was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \\'suicide.\\' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it.\\nThe matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank.\"\\n\"One moment.\"\\nHolmes interposed, \"your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened.\\nLet me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\"\\n\"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883.\\nHis death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.\"\\n\"Thank you.\\nPray proceed.\"\\n\"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up.\\nWe found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed.\\nOn the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K.\\nK.\\nK.\\nrepeated upon it, and \\'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\\' written beneath.\\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw.\\nFor the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\\'s life in America.\\nSome of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.\\nOthers were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.\\n\"Well, it was the beginning of \\'84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of \\'85.\\nOn the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table.\\nThere he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one.\\nHe had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.\\n\"\\'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\\' he stammered.\\n\"My heart had turned to lead.\\n\\'It is K.\\nK.\\nK.,\\' said I.\\n\"He looked inside the envelope.\\n\\'So it is,\\' he cried.\\n\\'Here are the very letters.\\nBut what is this written above them?\\'\\n\"\\'Put the papers on the sundial,\\' I read, peeping over his shoulder.\\n\"\\'What papers?\\nWhat sundial?\\' he asked.\\n\"\\'The sundial in the garden.\\nThere is no other,\\' said I; \\'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.\\'\\n\"\\'Pooh!\\' said he, gripping hard at his courage.\\n\\'We are in a civilised land here, and we can\\'t have tomfoolery of this kind.\\nWhere does the thing come from?\\'\\n\"\\'From Dundee,\\' I answered, glancing at the postmark.\\n\"\\'Some preposterous practical joke,\\' said he.\\n\\'What have I to do with sundials and papers?\\nI shall take no notice of such nonsense.\\'\\n\"\\'I should certainly speak to the police,\\' I said.\\n\"\\'And be laughed at for my pains.\\nNothing of the sort.\\'\\n\"\\'Then let me do so?\\'\\n\"\\'No, I forbid you.\\nI won\\'t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\\'\\n\"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man.\\nI went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\n\"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill.\\nI was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home.\\nIn that, however, I was in error.\\nUpon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once.\\nMy father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.\\nI hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness.\\nHe had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \\'death from accidental causes.\\' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder.\\nThere were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.\\nAnd yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\n\"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance.\\nYou will ask me why I did not dispose of it?\\nI answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\\'s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.\\n\"It was in January, \\'85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then.\\nDuring that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation.\\nI had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\"\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\n\"This is the envelope.\"\\nhe continued.\\n\"The postmark is London--eastern division.\\nWithin are the very words which were upon my father\\'s last message: \\'K.\\nK.\\nK.\\'; and then \\'Put the papers on the sundial..\"\\n\"What have you done?\"\\nasked Holmes.\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\"Nothing?\"\\n\"To tell the truth\"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--\"I have felt helpless.\\nI have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it.\\nI seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.\"\\n\"Tut!\\ntut.\"\\ncried Sherlock Holmes.\\n\"You must act, man, or you are lost.\\nNothing but energy can save you.\\nThis is no time for despair.\"\\n\"I have seen the police.\"\\n\"Ah.\"\\n\"But they listened to my story with a smile.\\nI am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\"\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air.\\n\"Incredible imbecility.\"\\nhe cried.\\n\"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.\"\\n\"Has he come with you to-night?\"\\n\"No.\\nHis orders were to stay in the house.\"\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\n\"Why did you come to me.\"\\nhe cried, \"and, above all, why did you not come at once?\"\\n\"I did not know.\\nIt was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\"\\n\"It is really two days since you had the letter.\\nWe should have acted before this.\\nYou have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which might help us?\"\\n\"There is one thing.\"\\nsaid John Openshaw.\\nHe rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table.\\n\"I have some remembrance.\"\\nsaid he, \"that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour.\\nI found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction.\\nBeyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much.\\nI think myself that it is a page from some private diary.\\nThe writing is undoubtedly my uncle\\'s.\"\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book.\\nIt was headed, \"March, 1869.\"\\nand beneath were the following enigmatical notices:  \"4th.\\nHudson came.\\nSame old platform.\\n\"7th.\\nSet the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and       John Swain, of St.\\nAugustine.\\n\"9th.\\nMcCauley cleared.\\n\"10th.\\nJohn Swain cleared.\\n\"12th.\\nVisited Paramore.\\nAll well.\"\\n\"Thank you.\"\\nsaid Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor.\\n\"And now you must on no account lose another instant.\\nWe cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me.\\nYou must get home instantly and act.\"\\n\"What shall I do?\"\\n\"There is but one thing to do.\\nIt must be done at once.\\nYou must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described.\\nYou must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains.\\nYou must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them.\\nHaving done this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed.\\nDo you understand?\"\\n\"Entirely.\"\\n\"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present.\\nI think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven.\\nThe first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you.\\nThe second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\"\\n\"I thank you.\"\\nsaid the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.\\n\"You have given me fresh life and hope.\\nI shall certainly do as you advise.\"\\n\"Do not lose an instant.\\nAnd, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger.\\nHow do you go back?\"\\n\"By train from Waterloo.\"\\n\"It is not yet nine.\\nThe streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety.\\nAnd yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\"\\n\"I am armed.\"\\n\"That is well.\\nTo-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\"\\n\"I shall see you at Horsham, then?\"\\n\"No, your secret lies in London.\\nIt is there that I shall seek it.\"\\n\"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers.\\nI shall take your advice in every particular.\"\\nHe shook hands with us and took his leave.\\nOutside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows.\\nThis strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire.\\nThen he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\\n\"I think, Watson.\"\\nhe remarked at last, \"that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this.\"\\n\"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\"\\n\"Well, yes.\\nSave, perhaps, that.\\nAnd yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\"\\n\"But have you.\"\\nI asked, \"formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?\"\\n\"There can be no question as to their nature.\"\\nhe answered.\\n\"Then what are they?\\nWho is this K.\\nK.\\nK., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?\"\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together.\\n\"The ideal reasoner.\"\\nhe remarked, \"would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it.\\nAs Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after.\\nWe have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to.\\nProblems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses.\\nTo carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment.\\nIt is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do.\\nIf I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nI answered, laughing.\\n\"It was a singular document.\\nPhilosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember.\\nBotany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.\\nThose, I think, were the main points of my analysis.\"\\nHolmes grinned at the last item.\\n\"Well.\"\\nhe said, \"I say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.\\nNow, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources.\\nKindly hand me down the letter K of the \\'American Encyclopaedia\\' which stands upon the shelf beside you.\\nThank you.\\nNow let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it.\\nIn the first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America.\\nMen at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town.\\nHis extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America.\\nAs to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors.\\nDid you remark the postmarks of those letters?\"\\n\"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.\"\\n\"From East London.\\nWhat do you deduce from that?\"\\n\"They are all seaports.\\nThat the writer was on board of a ship.\"\\n\"Excellent.\\nWe have already a clue.\\nThere can be no doubt that the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship.\\nAnd now let us consider another point.\\nIn the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.\\nDoes that suggest anything?\"\\n\"A greater distance to travel.\"\\n\"But the letter had also a greater distance to come.\"\\n\"Then I do not see the point.\"\\n\"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship.\\nIt looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.\\nYou see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee.\\nIf they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.\\nBut, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed.\\nI think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer.\"\\n\"It is possible.\"\\n\"More than that.\\nIt is probable.\\nAnd now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution.\\nThe blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance.\\nBut this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\"\\n\"Good God.\"\\nI cried.\\n\"What can it mean, this relentless persecution?\"\\n\"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship.\\nI think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.\\nA single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\\'s jury.\\nThere must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.\\nTheir papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.\\nIn this way you see K.\\nK.\\nK.\\nceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.\"\\n\"But of what society?\"\\n\"Have you never-.\"\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--\"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\"\\n\"I never have.\"\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee.\\n\"Here it is.\"\\nsaid he presently:  \"\\'Ku Klux Klan.\\nA name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle.\\nThis terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida.\\nIts power was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views.\\nIts outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others.\\nOn receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country.\\nIf he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner.\\nSo perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators.\\nFor some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the community in the South.\\nEventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\\'\\n\"You will observe.\"\\nsaid Holmes, laying down the volume, \"that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers.\\nIt may well have been cause and effect.\\nIt is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.\\nYou can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\"\\n\"Then the page we have seen-.\"\\n\"Is such as we might expect.\\nIt ran, if I remember right, \\'sent the pips to A, B, and C\\'--that is, sent the society\\'s warning to them.\\nThen there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.\\nWell, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him.\\nThere is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men.\"\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.\\nSherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\n\"You will excuse me for not waiting for you.\"\\nsaid he; \"I have, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw\\'s.\"\\n\"What steps will you take?\"\\nI asked.\\n\"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.\\nI may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\"\\n\"You will not go there first?\"\\n\"No, I shall commence with the City.\\nJust ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee.\"\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it.\\nIt rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\n\"Holmes.\"\\nI cried, \"you are too late.\"\\n\"Ah.\"\\nsaid he, laying down his cup, \"I feared as much.\\nHow was it done?\"\\nHe spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\n\"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading \\'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.\\' Here is the account:  \"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water.\\nThe night, however, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue.\\nThe alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered.\\nIt proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.\\nIt is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.\\nThe body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\"\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\\n\"That hurts my pride, Watson.\"\\nhe said at last.\\n\"It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride.\\nIt becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.\\nThat he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death--.\"\\nHe sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.\\n\"They must be cunning devils.\"\\nhe exclaimed at last.\\n\"How could they have decoyed him down there?\\nThe Embankment is not on the direct line to the station.\\nThe bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose.\\nWell, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run.\\nI am going out now.\"\\n\"To the police?\"\\n\"No; I shall be my own police.\\nWhen I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not before.\"\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker Street.\\nSherlock Holmes had not come back yet.\\nIt was nearly ten o\\'clock before he entered, looking pale and worn.\\nHe walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.\\n\"You are hungry.\"\\nI remarked.\\n\"Starving.\\nIt had escaped my memory.\\nI have had nothing since breakfast.\"\\n\"Nothing?\"\\n\"Not a bite.\\nI had no time to think of it.\"\\n\"And how have you succeeded?\"\\n\"Well.\"\\n\"You have a clue?\"\\n\"I have them in the hollow of my hand.\\nYoung Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged.\\nWhy, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them.\\nIt is well thought of.\"\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table.\\nOf these he took five and thrust them into an envelope.\\nOn the inside of the flap he wrote \"S.\\nH.\\nfor J.\\nO.\"\\nThen he sealed it and addressed it to \"Captain James Calhoun, Barque \\'Lone Star,\\' Savannah, Georgia.\"\\n\"That will await him when he enters port.\"\\nsaid he, chuckling.\\n\"It may give him a sleepless night.\\nHe will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\"\\n\"And who is this Captain Calhoun?\"\\n\"The leader of the gang.\\nI shall have the others, but he first.\"\\n\"How did you trace it, then?\"\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.\\n\"I have spent the whole day.\"\\nsaid he, \"over Lloyd\\'s registers and files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in \\'83.\\nThere were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months.\\nOf these, one, the \\'Lone Star,\\' instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.\"\\n\"Texas, I think.\"\\n\"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.\"\\n\"What then?\"\\n\"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque \\'Lone Star\\' was there in January, \\'85, my suspicion became a certainty.\\nI then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London.\"\\n\"Yes?\"\\n\"The \\'Lone Star\\' had arrived here last week.\\nI went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah.\\nI wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\"\\n\"What will you do, then?\"\\n\"Oh, I have my hand upon him.\\nHe and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship.\\nThe others are Finns and Germans.\\nI know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night.\\nI had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo.\\nBy the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\"\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track.\\nVery long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year.\\nWe waited long for news of the \"Lone Sta.\"\\nof Savannah, but none ever reached us.\\nWe did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters \"L.\\nS.\"\\ncarved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the \"Lone Star.\"\\nADVENTURE VI.\\nTHE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP  Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St.\\nGeorge\\'s, was much addicted to opium.\\nThe habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey\\'s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects.\\nHe found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives.\\nI can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\\nOne night--it was in June, \\'89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock.\\nI sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.\\n\"A patient.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"You\\'ll have to go out.\"\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum.\\nOur own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\n\"You will excuse my calling so late.\"\\nshe began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife\\'s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder.\\n\"Oh, I\\'m in such trouble.\"\\nshe cried; \"I do so want a little help.\"\\n\"Why.\"\\nsaid my wife, pulling up her veil, \"it is Kate Whitney.\\nHow you startled me, Kate!\\nI had not an idea who you were when you came in.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t know what to do, so I came straight to you.\"\\nThat was always the way.\\nFolk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.\\n\"It was very sweet of you to come.\\nNow, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it.\\nOr should you rather that I sent James off to bed?\"\\n\"Oh, no, no!\\nI want the doctor\\'s advice and help, too.\\nIt\\'s about Isa.\\nHe has not been home for two days.\\nI am so frightened about him.\"\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\\'s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion.\\nWe soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.\\nDid she know where her husband was?\\nWas it possible that we could bring him back to her?\\nIt seems that it was.\\nShe had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City.\\nHitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening.\\nBut now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects.\\nThere he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane.\\nBut what was she to do?\\nHow could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.\\nMight I not escort her to this place?\\nAnd then, as a second thought, why should she come at all?\\nI was Isa Whitney\\'s medical adviser, and as such I had influence over him.\\nI could manage it better if I were alone.\\nI promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me.\\nAnd so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.\\nUpper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.\\nBetween a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.\\nOrdering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer.\\nOut of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes.\\nThe most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour.\\nAt the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\n\"Thank you.\\nI have not come to stay.\"\\nsaid I.\\n\"There is a friend of mine here, Mr.\\nIsa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.\"\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.\\n\"My God!\\nIt\\'s Watson.\"\\nsaid he.\\nHe was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter.\\n\"I say, Watson, what o\\'clock is it?\"\\n\"Nearly eleven.\"\\n\"Of what day?\"\\n\"Of Friday, June 19th.\"\\n\"Good heavens!\\nI thought it was Wednesday.\\nIt is Wednesday.\\nWhat d\\'you want to frighten a chap for?\"\\nHe sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.\\n\"I tell you that it is Friday, man.\\nYour wife has been waiting this two days for you.\\nYou should be ashamed of yourself.\"\\n\"So I am.\\nBut you\\'ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many.\\nBut I\\'ll go home with you.\\nI wouldn\\'t frighten Kate--poor little Kate.\\nGive me your hand!\\nHave you a cab?\"\\n\"Yes, I have one waiting.\"\\n\"Then I shall go in it.\\nBut I must owe something.\\nFind what I owe, Watson.\\nI am all off colour.\\nI can do nothing for myself.\"\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager.\\nAs I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, \"Walk past me, and then look back at me.\"\\nThe words fell quite distinctly upon my ear.\\nI glanced down.\\nThey could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers.\\nI took two steps forward and looked back.\\nIt took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment.\\nHe had turned his back so that none could see him but I.\\nHis form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes.\\nHe made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.\\n\"Holmes.\"\\nI whispered, \"what on earth are you doing in this den?\"\\n\"As low as you can.\"\\nhe answered; \"I have excellent ears.\\nIf you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\"\\n\"I have a cab outside.\"\\n\"Then pray send him home in it.\\nYou may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief.\\nI should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me.\\nIf you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.\"\\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\\' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery.\\nI felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence.\\nIn a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\\'s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness.\\nIn a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes.\\nFor two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.\\nThen, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\\n\"I suppose, Watson.\"\\nsaid he, \"that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\"\\n\"I was certainly surprised to find you there.\"\\n\"But not more so than I to find you.\"\\n\"I came to find a friend.\"\\n\"And I to find an enemy.\"\\n\"An enemy?\"\\n\"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.\\nBriefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now.\\nHad I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour\\'s purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me.\\nThere is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul\\'s Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\"\\n\"What!\\nYou do not mean bodies?\"\\n\"Ay, bodies, Watson.\\nWe should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den.\\nIt is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St.\\nClair has entered it never to leave it more.\\nBut our trap should be here.\"\\nHe put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\\' hoofs.\\n\"Now, Watson.\"\\nsaid Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns.\\n\"You\\'ll come with me, won\\'t you?\"\\n\"If I can be of use.\"\\n\"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.\\nMy room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\"\\n\"The Cedars?\"\\n\"Yes; that is Mr.\\nSt.\\nClair\\'s house.\\nI am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.\"\\n\"Where is it, then?\"\\n\"Near Lee, in Kent.\\nWe have a seven-mile drive before us.\"\\n\"But I am all in the dark.\"\\n\"Of course you are.\\nYou\\'ll know all about it presently.\\nJump up here.\\nAll right, John; we shall not need you.\\nHere\\'s half a crown.\\nLook out for me to-morrow, about eleven.\\nGive her her head.\\nSo long, then.\"\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us.\\nBeyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers.\\nA dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds.\\nHolmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts.\\nWe had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\\n\"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.\\n\\'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant.\\nI was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\"\\n\"You forget that I know nothing about it.\"\\n\"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee.\\nIt seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon.\\nThere\\'s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\\'t get the end of it into my hand.\\nNow, I\\'ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\"\\n\"Proceed, then.\"\\n\"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St.\\nClair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money.\\nHe took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style.\\nBy degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children.\\nHe had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night.\\nMr.\\nSt.\\nClair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him.\\nI may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.\\nThere is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.\\n\"Last Monday Mr.\\nNeville St.\\nClair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks.\\nNow, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.\\nNow, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night.\\nMrs.\\nSt.\\nClair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\\'s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station.\\nHave you followed me so far?\"\\n\"It is very clear.\"\\n\"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs.\\nSt.\\nClair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.\\nWhile she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window.\\nThe window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated.\\nHe waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.\\nOne singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\\n\"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor.\\nAt the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street.\\nFilled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat.\\nThe inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr.\\nSt.\\nClair had last been seen.\\nThere was no sign of him there.\\nIn fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there.\\nBoth he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon.\\nSo determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs.\\nSt.\\nClair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it.\\nOut there fell a cascade of children\\'s bricks.\\nIt was the toy which he had promised to bring home.\\n\"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.\\nThe rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime.\\nThe front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.\\nBetween the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water.\\nThe bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below.\\nOn examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom.\\nThrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr.\\nNeville St.\\nClair, with the exception of his coat.\\nHis boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there.\\nThere were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr.\\nNeville St.\\nClair.\\nOut of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.\\n\"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter.\\nThe Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs.\\nSt.\\nClair\\'s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\\'s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime.\\nHis defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman\\'s clothes.\\n\"So much for the Lascar manager.\\nNow for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.\\nClair.\\nHis name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City.\\nHe is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas.\\nSome little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall.\\nHere it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him.\\nI have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time.\\nHis appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him.\\nA shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.\\nThis is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\"\\n\"But a cripple.\"\\nsaid I.\\n\"What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?\"\\n\"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.\\nSurely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\"\\n\"Pray continue your narrative.\"\\n\"Mrs.\\nSt.\\nClair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.\\nInspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter.\\nOne mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him.\\nThere were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source.\\nHe denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.\\nNeville St.\\nClair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police.\\nAs to Mrs.\\nSt.\\nClair\\'s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming.\\nHe was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.\\n\"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find.\\nIt was Neville St.\\nClair\\'s coat, and not Neville St.\\nClair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded.\\nAnd what do you think they found in the pockets?\"\\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\\n\"No, I don\\'t think you would guess.\\nEvery pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies.\\nIt was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide.\\nBut a human body is a different matter.\\nThere is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house.\\nIt seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\"\\n\"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.\\nWould the body be dressed in a coat alone?\"\\n\"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough.\\nSuppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St.\\nClair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.\\nWhat would he do then?\\nIt would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments.\\nHe would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink.\\nHe has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\\nThere is not an instant to be lost.\\nHe rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat\\'s sinking.\\nHe throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\"\\n\"It certainly sounds feasible.\"\\n\"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.\\nBoone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him.\\nHe had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one.\\nThere the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St.\\nClair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever.\\nI confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\"\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.\\nJust as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.\\n\"We are on the outskirts of Lee.\"\\nsaid my companion.\\n\"We have touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.\\nSee that light among the trees?\\nThat is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse\\'s feet.\"\\n\"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\"\\nI asked.\\n\"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.\\nMrs.\\nSt.\\nClair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague.\\nI hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her husband.\\nHere we are.\\nWhoa, there, whoa.\"\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds.\\nA stable-boy had run out to the horse\\'s head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house.\\nAs we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists.\\nShe stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.\\n\"Well?\"\\nshe cried, \"well?\"\\nAnd then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"No good news?\"\\n\"None.\"\\n\"No bad?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Thank God for that.\\nBut come in.\\nYou must be weary, for you have had a long day.\"\\n\"This is my friend, Dr.\\nWatson.\\nHe has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.\"\\n\"I am delighted to see you.\"\\nsaid she, pressing my hand warmly.\\n\"You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.\"\\n\"My dear madam.\"\\nsaid I, \"I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed.\\nIf I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy.\"\\n\"Now, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes.\"\\nsaid the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, \"I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer.\"\\n\"Certainly, madam.\"\\n\"Do not trouble about my feelings.\\nI am not hysterical, nor given to fainting.\\nI simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\"\\n\"Upon what point?\"\\n\"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\"\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.\\n\"Frankly, now.\"\\nshe repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\\n\"Frankly, then, madam, I do not.\"\\n\"You think that he is dead?\"\\n\"I do.\"\\n\"Murdered?\"\\n\"I don\\'t say that.\\nPerhaps.\"\\n\"And on what day did he meet his death?\"\\n\"On Monday.\"\\n\"Then perhaps, Mr.\\nHolmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from him to-day.\"\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.\\n\"What.\"\\nhe roared.\\n\"Yes, to-day.\"\\nShe stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.\\n\"May I see it?\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently.\\nI had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder.\\nThe envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.\\n\"Coarse writing.\"\\nmurmured Holmes.\\n\"Surely this is not your husband\\'s writing, madam.\"\\n\"No, but the enclosure is.\"\\n\"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.\"\\n\"How can you tell that?\"\\n\"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.\\nThe rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used.\\nIf it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade.\\nThis man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it.\\nIt is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles.\\nLet us now see the letter.\\nHa!\\nthere has been an enclosure here.\"\\n\"Yes, there was a ring.\\nHis signet-ring.\"\\n\"And you are sure that this is your husband\\'s hand?\"\\n\"One of his hands.\"\\n\"One?\"\\n\"His hand when he wrote hurriedly.\\nIt is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well.\"\\n\"\\'Dearest do not be frightened.\\nAll will come well.\\nThere is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify.\\nWait in patience.--NEVILLE.\\' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark.\\nHum!\\nPosted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb.\\nHa!\\nAnd the flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco.\\nAnd you have no doubt that it is your husband\\'s hand, madam?\"\\n\"None.\\nNeville wrote those words.\"\\n\"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend.\\nWell, Mrs.\\nSt.\\nClair, the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is over.\"\\n\"But he must be alive, Mr.\\nHolmes.\"\\n\"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.\\nThe ring, after all, proves nothing.\\nIt may have been taken from him.\"\\n\"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing.\"\\n\"Very well.\\nIt may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.\"\\n\"That is possible.\"\\n\"If so, much may have happened between.\"\\n\"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nI know that all is well with him.\\nThere is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him.\\nOn the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened.\\nDo you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\"\\n\"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.\\nAnd in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view.\\nBut if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?\"\\n\"I cannot imagine.\\nIt is unthinkable.\"\\n\"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\"\\n\"Very much so.\"\\n\"Was the window open?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Then he might have called to you?\"\\n\"He might.\"\\n\"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"A call for help, you thought?\"\\n\"Yes.\\nHe waved his hands.\"\\n\"But it might have been a cry of surprise.\\nAstonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\"\\n\"It is possible.\"\\n\"And you thought he was pulled back?\"\\n\"He disappeared so suddenly.\"\\n\"He might have leaped back.\\nYou did not see anyone else in the room?\"\\n\"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\"\\n\"Quite so.\\nYour husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?\"\\n\"But without his collar or tie.\\nI distinctly saw his bare throat.\"\\n\"Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\"\\n\"Never.\"\\n\"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\"\\n\"Never.\"\\n\"Thank you, Mrs.\\nSt.\\nClair.\\nThose are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear.\\nWe shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\"\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure.\\nSherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient.\\nIt was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting.\\nHe took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs.\\nWith these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.\\nIn the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features.\\nSo he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment.\\nThe pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\\n\"Awake, Watson?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Game for a morning drive?\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\"Then dress.\\nNo one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\"\\nHe chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch.\\nIt was no wonder that no one was stirring.\\nIt was twenty-five minutes past four.\\nI had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.\\n\"I want to test a little theory of mine.\"\\nsaid he, pulling on his boots.\\n\"I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe.\\nI deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross.\\nBut I think I have the key of the affair now.\"\\n\"And where is it?\"\\nI asked, smiling.\\n\"In the bathroom.\"\\nhe answered.\\n\"Oh, yes, I am not joking.\"\\nhe continued, seeing my look of incredulity.\\n\"I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag.\\nCome on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\"\\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine.\\nIn the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head.\\nWe both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road.\\nA few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\n\"It has been in some points a singular case.\"\\nsaid Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop.\\n\"I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\"\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.\\nPassing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street.\\nSherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him.\\nOne of them held the horse\\'s head while the other led us in.\\n\"Who is on duty?\"\\nasked Holmes.\\n\"Inspector Bradstreet, sir.\"\\n\"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?\"\\nA tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket.\\n\"I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\"\\n\"Certainly, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nStep into my room here.\"\\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall.\\nThe inspector sat down at his desk.\\n\"What can I do for you, Mr.\\nHolmes?\"\\n\"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr.\\nNeville St.\\nClair, of Lee.\"\\n\"Yes.\\nHe was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\"\\n\"So I heard.\\nYou have him here?\"\\n\"In the cells.\"\\n\"Is he quiet?\"\\n\"Oh, he gives no trouble.\\nBut he is a dirty scoundrel.\"\\n\"Dirty?\"\\n\"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker\\'s.\\nWell, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\"\\n\"I should like to see him very much.\"\\n\"Would you?\\nThat is easily done.\\nCome this way.\\nYou can leave your bag.\"\\n\"No, I think that I\\'ll take it.\"\\n\"Very good.\\nCome this way, if you please.\"\\nHe led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\n\"The third on the right is his.\"\\nsaid the inspector.\\n\"Here it is.\"\\nHe quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.\\n\"He is asleep.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"You can see him very well.\"\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating.\\nThe prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily.\\nHe was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat.\\nHe was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness.\\nA broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl.\\nA shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.\\n\"He\\'s a beauty, isn\\'t he?\"\\nsaid the inspector.\\n\"He certainly needs a wash.\"\\nremarked Holmes.\\n\"I had an idea that he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\"\\nHe opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.\\n\"He!\\nhe!\\nYou are a funny one.\"\\nchuckled the inspector.\\n\"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know why not.\"\\nsaid the inspector.\\n\"He doesn\\'t look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\"\\nHe slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell.\\nThe sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber.\\nHolmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner\\'s face.\\n\"Let me introduce you.\"\\nhe shouted, \"to Mr.\\nNeville St.\\nClair, of Lee, in the county of Kent.\"\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight.\\nThe man\\'s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree.\\nGone was the coarse brown tint!\\nGone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face!\\nA twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.\\nThen suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\\n\"Great heavens.\"\\ncried the inspector, \"it is, indeed, the missing man.\\nI know him from the photograph.\"\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny.\\n\"Be it so.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"And pray what am I charged with?\"\\n\"With making away with Mr.\\nNeville St.-- Oh, come, you can\\'t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it.\"\\nsaid the inspector with a grin.\\n\"Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\"\\n\"If I am Mr.\\nNeville St.\\nClair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\"\\n\"No crime, but a very great error has been committed.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"You would have done better to have trusted your wife.\"\\n\"It was not the wife; it was the children.\"\\ngroaned the prisoner.\\n\"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father.\\nMy God!\\nWhat an exposure!\\nWhat can I do?\"\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.\\n\"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up.\"\\nsaid he, \"of course you can hardly avoid publicity.\\nOn the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers.\\nInspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities.\\nThe case would then never go into court at all.\"\\n\"God bless you.\"\\ncried the prisoner passionately.\\n\"I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.\\n\"You are the first who have ever heard my story.\\nMy father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.\\nI travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London.\\nOne day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them.\\nThere was the point from which all my adventures started.\\nIt was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles.\\nWhen an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill.\\nI took advantage now of my attainments.\\nI painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster.\\nThen with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.\\nFor seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s.\\n4d.\\n\"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25 pounds.\\nI was at my wit\\'s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me.\\nI begged a fortnight\\'s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise.\\nIn ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.\\n\"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still.\\nIt was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers.\\nOnly one man knew my secret.\\nHe was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town.\\nThis fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\\n\"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.\\nI do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.\\nAll day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.\\n\"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation.\\nMy dear wife knew that I had business in the City.\\nShe little knew what.\\n\"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me.\\nI gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me.\\nI heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend.\\nSwiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig.\\nEven a wife\\'s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise.\\nBut then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me.\\nI threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning.\\nThen I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings.\\nI hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames.\\nThe other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.\\nNeville St.\\nClair, I was arrested as his murderer.\\n\"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain.\\nI was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face.\\nKnowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\"\\n\"That note only reached her yesterday.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Good God!\\nWhat a week she must have spent.\"\\n\"The police have watched this Lascar.\"\\nsaid Inspector Bradstreet, \"and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved.\\nProbably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\"\\n\"That was it.\"\\nsaid Holmes, nodding approvingly; \"I have no doubt of it.\\nBut have you never been prosecuted for begging?\"\\n\"Many times; but what was a fine to me?\"\\n\"It must stop here, however.\"\\nsaid Bradstreet.\\n\"If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\"\\n\"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\"\\n\"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken.\\nBut if you are found again, then all must come out.\\nI am sure, Mr.\\nHolmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up.\\nI wish I knew how you reach your results.\"\\n\"I reached this one.\"\\nsaid my friend, \"by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag.\\nI think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\"\\nVII.\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE  I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season.\\nHe was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand.\\nBeside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places.\\nA lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.\\n\"You are engaged.\"\\nsaid I; \"perhaps I interrupt you.\"\\n\"Not at all.\\nI am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results.\\nThe matter is a perfectly trivial one\"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--\"but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\"\\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals.\\n\"I suppose.\"\\nI remarked, \"that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.\"\\n\"No, no.\\nNo crime.\"\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes, laughing.\\n\"Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.\\nAmid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal.\\nWe have already had experience of such.\"\\n\"So much so.\"\\nI remarked, \"that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\"\\n\"Precisely.\\nYou allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip.\\nWell, I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.\\nYou know Peterson, the commissionaire?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"It is to him that this trophy belongs.\"\\n\"It is his hat.\"\\n\"No, no, he found it.\\nIts owner is unknown.\\nI beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.\\nAnd, first, as to how it came here.\\nIt arrived upon Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson\\'s fire.\\nThe facts are these: about four o\\'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road.\\nIn front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder.\\nAs he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs.\\nOne of the latter knocked off the man\\'s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.\\nPeterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road.\\nThe roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.\"\\n\"Which surely he restored to their owner?\"\\n\"My dear fellow, there lies the problem.\\nIt is true that \\'For Mrs.\\nHenry Baker\\' was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\\'s left leg, and it is also true that the initials \\'H.\\nB.\\' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.\"\\n\"What, then, did Peterson do?\"\\n\"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.\\nThe goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay.\\nIts finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\"\\n\"Did he not advertise?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?\"\\n\"Only as much as we can deduce.\"\\n\"From his hat?\"\\n\"Precisely.\"\\n\"But you are joking.\\nWhat can you gather from this old battered felt?\"\\n\"Here is my lens.\\nYou know my methods.\\nWhat can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\"\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully.\\nIt was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear.\\nThe lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.\\nThere was no maker\\'s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials \"H.\\nB.\"\\nwere scrawled upon one side.\\nIt was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing.\\nFor the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.\\n\"I can see nothing.\"\\nsaid I, handing it back to my friend.\\n\"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything.\\nYou fail, however, to reason from what you see.\\nYou are too timid in drawing your inferences.\"\\n\"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\"\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him.\\n\"It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been.\"\\nhe remarked, \"and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability.\\nThat the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days.\\nHe had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him.\\nThis may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.\"\\n\"My dear Holmes.\"\\n\"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect.\"\\nhe continued, disregarding my remonstrance.\\n\"He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream.\\nThese are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat.\\nAlso, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.\"\\n\"You are certainly joking, Holmes.\"\\n\"Not in the least.\\nIs it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?\"\\n\"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you.\\nFor example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?\"\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head.\\nIt came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose.\\n\"It is a question of cubic capacity.\"\\nsaid he; \"a man with so large a brain must have something in it.\"\\n\"The decline of his fortunes, then?\"\\n\"This hat is three years old.\\nThese flat brims curled at the edge came in then.\\nIt is a hat of the very best quality.\\nLook at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.\\nIf this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\"\\n\"Well, that is clear enough, certainly.\\nBut how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?\"\\nSherlock Holmes laughed.\\n\"Here is the foresight.\"\\nsaid he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.\\n\"They are never sold upon hats.\\nIf this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind.\\nBut since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature.\\nOn the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\"\\n\"Your reasoning is certainly plausible.\"\\n\"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.\\nThe lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.\\nThey all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream.\\nThis dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training.\"\\n\"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him.\"\\n\"This hat has not been brushed for weeks.\\nWhen I see you, my dear Watson, with a week\\'s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\\'s affection.\"\\n\"But he might be a bachelor.\"\\n\"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\nRemember the card upon the bird\\'s leg.\"\\n\"You have an answer to everything.\\nBut how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?\"\\n\"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.\\nAnyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet.\\nAre you satisfied?\"\\n\"Well, it is very ingenious.\"\\nsaid I, laughing; \"but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\"\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\n\"The goose, Mr.\\nHolmes!\\nThe goose, sir.\"\\nhe gasped.\\n\"Eh?\\nWhat of it, then?\\nHas it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?\"\\nHolmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man\\'s excited face.\\n\"See here, sir!\\nSee what my wife found in its crop.\"\\nHe held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle.\\n\"By Jove, Peterson.\"\\nsaid he, \"this is treasure trove indeed.\\nI suppose you know what you have got?\"\\n\"A diamond, sir?\\nA precious stone.\\nIt cuts into glass as though it were putty.\"\\n\"It\\'s more than a precious stone.\\nIt is the precious stone.\"\\n\"Not the Countess of Morcar\\'s blue carbuncle.\"\\nI ejaculated.\\n\"Precisely so.\\nI ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately.\\nIt is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.\"\\n\"A thousand pounds!\\nGreat Lord of mercy.\"\\nThe commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.\\n\"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem.\"\\n\"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.\"\\nI remarked.\\n\"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago.\\nJohn Horner, a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\\'s jewel-case.\\nThe evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes.\\nI have some account of the matter here, I believe.\"\\nHe rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:  \"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery.\\nJohn Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle.\\nJames Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose.\\nHe had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away.\\nOn returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table.\\nRyder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms.\\nCatherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\\'s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness.\\nInspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms.\\nEvidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes.\\nHorner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.\"\\n\"Hum!\\nSo much for the police-court.\"\\nsaid Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper.\\n\"The question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other.\\nYou see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect.\\nHere is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr.\\nHenry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you.\\nSo now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery.\\nTo do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers.\\nIf this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.\"\\n\"What will you say?\"\\n\"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper.\\nNow, then: \\'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat.\\nMr.\\nHenry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.\\' That is clear and concise.\"\\n\"Very.\\nBut will he see it?\"\\n\"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one.\\nHe was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird.\\nThen, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it.\\nHere you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers.\"\\n\"In which, sir?\"\\n\"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St.\\nJames\\'s, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you.\"\\n\"Very well, sir.\\nAnd this stone?\"\\n\"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone.\\nThank you.\\nAnd, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring.\"\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light.\\n\"It\\'s a bonny thing.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Just see how it glints and sparkles.\\nOf course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.\\nEvery good stone is.\\nThey are the devil\\'s pet baits.\\nIn the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.\\nThis stone is not yet twenty years old.\\nIt was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red.\\nIn spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history.\\nThere have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.\\nWho would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?\\nI\\'ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.\"\\n\"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?\"\\n\"I cannot tell.\"\\n\"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the matter?\"\\n\"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold.\\nThat, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.\"\\n\"And you can do nothing until then?\"\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\"In that case I shall continue my professional round.\\nBut I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.\"\\n\"Very glad to see you.\\nI dine at seven.\\nThere is a woodcock, I believe.\\nBy the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.\\nHudson to examine its crop.\"\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more.\\nAs I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight.\\nJust as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes\\' room.\\n\"Mr.\\nHenry Baker, I believe.\"\\nsaid he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume.\\n\"Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.\\nBaker.\\nIt is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter.\\nAh, Watson, you have just come at the right time.\\nIs that your hat, Mr.\\nBaker?\"\\n\"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\"\\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown.\\nA touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes\\' surmise as to his habits.\\nHis rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt.\\nHe spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\n\"We have retained these things for some days.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address.\\nI am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.\"\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh.\\n\"Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were.\"\\nhe remarked.\\n\"I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird.\\nI did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.\"\\n\"Very naturally.\\nBy the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.\"\\n\"To eat it.\"\\nOur visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\\n\"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.\\nBut I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?\"\\n\"Oh, certainly, certainly.\"\\nanswered Mr.\\nBaker with a sigh of relief.\\n\"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish-.\"\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh.\\n\"They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure.\"\\nsaid he, \"but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me.\\nNo, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\"\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.\\n\"There is your hat, then, and there your bird.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?\\nI am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.\"\\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\\nsaid Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm.\\n\"There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in the Museum itself during the day, you understand.\\nThis year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas.\\nMy pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you.\\nI am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\"\\nWith a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way.\\n\"So much for Mr.\\nHenry Baker.\"\\nsaid Holmes when he had closed the door behind him.\\n\"It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter.\\nAre you hungry, Watson?\"\\n\"Not particularly.\"\\n\"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot.\"\\n\"By all means.\"\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats.\\nOutside, the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots.\\nOur footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors\\' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street.\\nIn a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn.\\nHolmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\\n\"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"My geese.\"\\nThe man seemed surprised.\\n\"Yes.\\nI was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr.\\nHenry Baker, who was a member of your goose club.\"\\n\"Ah!\\nyes, I see.\\nBut you see, sir, them\\'s not our geese.\"\\n\"Indeed!\\nWhose, then?\"\\n\"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\"\\n\"Indeed?\\nI know some of them.\\nWhich was it?\"\\n\"Breckinridge is his name.\"\\n\"Ah!\\nI don\\'t know him.\\nWell, here\\'s your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house.\\nGood-night.\"\\n\"Now for Mr.\\nBreckinridge.\"\\nhe continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air.\\n\"Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years\\' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence.\\nIt is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has placed in our hands.\\nLet us follow it out to the bitter end.\\nFaces to the south, then, and quick march.\"\\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market.\\nOne of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters.\\n\"Good-evening.\\nIt\\'s a cold night.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\nThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\\n\"Sold out of geese, I see.\"\\ncontinued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble.\\n\"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\"\\n\"That\\'s no good.\"\\n\"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\"\\n\"Ah, but I was recommended to you.\"\\n\"Who by?\"\\n\"The landlord of the Alpha.\"\\n\"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\"\\n\"Fine birds they were, too.\\nNow where did you get them from?\"\\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\\n\"Now, then, mister.\"\\nsaid he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, \"what are you driving at?\\nLet\\'s have it straight, now.\"\\n\"It is straight enough.\\nI should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha.\"\\n\"Well then, I shan\\'t tell you.\\nSo now.\"\\n\"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\\'t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle.\"\\n\"Warm!\\nYou\\'d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.\\nWhen I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but it\\'s \\'Where are the geese?\\' and \\'Who did you sell the geese to?\\' and \\'What will you take for the geese?\\' One would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them.\"\\n\"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries.\"\\nsaid Holmes carelessly.\\n\"If you won\\'t tell us the bet is off, that is all.\\nBut I\\'m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.\"\\n\"Well, then, you\\'ve lost your fiver, for it\\'s town bred.\"\\nsnapped the salesman.\\n\"It\\'s nothing of the kind.\"\\n\"I say it is.\"\\n\"I don\\'t believe it.\"\\n\"D\\'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a nipper?\\nI tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.\"\\n\"You\\'ll never persuade me to believe that.\"\\n\"Will you bet, then?\"\\n\"It\\'s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right.\\nBut I\\'ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\"\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly.\\n\"Bring me the books, Bill.\"\\nsaid he.\\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\\n\"Now then, Mr.\\nCocksure.\"\\nsaid the salesman, \"I thought that I was out of geese, but before I finish you\\'ll find that there is still one left in my shop.\\nYou see this little book?\"\\n\"Well?\"\\n\"That\\'s the list of the folk from whom I buy.\\nD\\'you see?\\nWell, then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.\\nNow, then!\\nYou see this other page in red ink?\\nWell, that is a list of my town suppliers.\\nNow, look at that third name.\\nJust read it out to me.\"\\n\"Mrs.\\nOakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249.\"\\nread Holmes.\\n\"Quite so.\\nNow turn that up in the ledger.\"\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated.\\n\"Here you are, \\'Mrs.\\nOakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier..\"\\n\"Now, then, what\\'s the last entry?\"\\n\"\\'December 22nd.\\nTwenty-four geese at 7s.\\n6d..\"\\n\"Quite so.\\nThere you are.\\nAnd underneath?\"\\n\"\\'Sold to Mr.\\nWindigate of the Alpha, at 12s..\"\\n\"What have you to say now?\"\\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined.\\nHe drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words.\\nA few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.\\n\"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \\'Pink \\'un\\' protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager.\\nWell, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs.\\nOakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow.\\nIt is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should-.\"\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left.\\nTurning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.\\n\"I\\'ve had enough of you and your geese.\"\\nhe shouted.\\n\"I wish you were all at the devil together.\\nIf you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I\\'ll set the dog at you.\\nYou bring Mrs.\\nOakshott here and I\\'ll answer her, but what have you to do with it?\\nDid I buy the geese off you?\"\\n\"No; but one of them was mine all the same.\"\\nwhined the little man.\\n\"Well, then, ask Mrs.\\nOakshott for it.\"\\n\"She told me to ask you.\"\\n\"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care.\\nI\\'ve had enough of it.\\nGet out of this.\"\\nHe rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.\\n\"Ha!\\nthis may save us a visit to Brixton Road.\"\\nwhispered Holmes.\\n\"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\"\\nStriding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder.\\nHe sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.\\n\"Who are you, then?\\nWhat do you want?\"\\nhe asked in a quavering voice.\\n\"You will excuse me.\"\\nsaid Holmes blandly, \"but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.\\nI think that I could be of assistance to you.\"\\n\"You?\\nWho are you?\\nHow could you know anything of the matter?\"\\n\"My name is Sherlock Holmes.\\nIt is my business to know what other people don\\'t know.\"\\n\"But you can know nothing of this?\"\\n\"Excuse me, I know everything of it.\\nYou are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs.\\nOakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.\\nWindigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.\\nHenry Baker is a member.\"\\n\"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet.\"\\ncried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.\\n\"I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\"\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing.\\n\"In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.\"\\nThe man hesitated for an instant.\\n\"My name is John Robinson.\"\\nhe answered with a sidelong glance.\\n\"No, no; the real name.\"\\nsaid Holmes sweetly.\\n\"It is always awkward doing business with an alias.\"\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger.\\n\"Well then.\"\\nsaid he, \"my real name is James Ryder.\"\\n\"Precisely so.\\nHead attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.\\nPray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.\"\\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.\\nThen he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street.\\nNothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\\n\"Here we are.\"\\nsaid Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.\\n\"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather.\\nYou look cold, Mr.\\nRyder.\\nPray take the basket-chair.\\nI will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours.\\nNow, then!\\nYou want to know what became of those geese?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose.\\nIt was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the tail.\"\\nRyder quivered with emotion.\\n\"Oh, sir.\"\\nhe cried, \"can you tell me where it went to?\"\\n\"It came here.\"\\n\"Here?\"\\n\"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved.\\nI don\\'t wonder that you should take an interest in it.\\nIt laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.\\nI have it here in my museum.\"\\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand.\\nHolmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance.\\nRyder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.\\n\"The game\\'s up, Ryder.\"\\nsaid Holmes quietly.\\n\"Hold up, man, or you\\'ll be into the fire!\\nGive him an arm back into his chair, Watson.\\nHe\\'s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity.\\nGive him a dash of brandy.\\nSo!\\nNow he looks a little more human.\\nWhat a shrimp it is, to be sure.\"\\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.\\n\"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.\\nStill, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete.\\nYou had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\\'s?\"\\n\"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it.\"\\nsaid he in a crackling voice.\\n\"I see--her ladyship\\'s waiting-maid.\\nWell, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used.\\nIt seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you.\\nYou knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.\\nWhat did you do, then?\\nYou made some small job in my lady\\'s room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he should be the man sent for.\\nThen, when he had left, you rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested.\\nYou then-.\"\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion\\'s knees.\\n\"For God\\'s sake, have mercy.\"\\nhe shrieked.\\n\"Think of my father!\\nOf my mother!\\nIt would break their hearts.\\nI never went wrong before!\\nI never will again.\\nI swear it.\\nI\\'ll swear it on a Bible.\\nOh, don\\'t bring it into court!\\nFor Christ\\'s sake, don\\'t.\"\\n\"Get back into your chair.\"\\nsaid Holmes sternly.\\n\"It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\"\\n\"I will fly, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nI will leave the country, sir.\\nThen the charge against him will break down.\"\\n\"Hum!\\nWe will talk about that.\\nAnd now let us hear a true account of the next act.\\nHow came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market?\\nTell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of safety.\"\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips.\\n\"I will tell you it just as it happened, sir.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room.\\nThere was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.\\nI went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister\\'s house.\\nShe had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.\\nAll the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road.\\nMy sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel.\\nThen I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.\\n\"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pentonville.\\nOne day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what they stole.\\nI knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence.\\nHe would show me how to turn the stone into money.\\nBut how to get to him in safety?\\nI thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel.\\nI might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket.\\nI was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\\n\"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word.\\nI would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn.\\nThere was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail.\\nI caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach.\\nThe bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop.\\nBut the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter.\\nAs I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.\\n\"\\'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\\' says she.\\n\"\\'Well,\\' said I, \\'you said you\\'d give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the fattest.\\'\\n\"\\'Oh,\\' says she, \\'we\\'ve set yours aside for you--Jem\\'s bird, we call it.\\nIt\\'s the big white one over yonder.\\nThere\\'s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\\'\\n\"\\'Thank you, Maggie,\\' says I; \\'but if it is all the same to you, I\\'d rather have that one I was handling just now.\\'\\n\"\\'The other is a good three pound heavier,\\' said she, \\'and we fattened it expressly for you.\\'\\n\"\\'Never mind.\\nI\\'ll have the other, and I\\'ll take it now,\\' said I.\\n\"\\'Oh, just as you like,\\' said she, a little huffed.\\n\\'Which is it you want, then?\\'\\n\"\\'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.\\'\\n\"\\'Oh, very well.\\nKill it and take it with you.\\'\\n\"Well, I did what she said, Mr.\\nHolmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn.\\nI told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to.\\nHe laughed until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose.\\nMy heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred.\\nI left the bird, rushed back to my sister\\'s, and hurried into the back yard.\\nThere was not a bird to be seen there.\\n\"\\'Where are they all, Maggie?\\' I cried.\\n\"\\'Gone to the dealer\\'s, Jem.\\'\\n\"\\'Which dealer\\'s?\\'\\n\"\\'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\\'\\n\"\\'But was there another with a barred tail?\\' I asked, \\'the same as the one I chose?\\'\\n\"\\'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.\\'\\n\"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone.\\nYou heard him yourselves to-night.\\nWell, he has always answered me like that.\\nMy sister thinks that I am going mad.\\nSometimes I think that I am myself.\\nAnd now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character.\\nGod help me!\\nGod help me.\"\\nHe burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\\' finger-tips upon the edge of the table.\\nThen my friend rose and threw open the door.\\n\"Get out.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"What, sir!\\nOh, Heaven bless you.\"\\n\"No more words.\\nGet out.\"\\nAnd no more words were needed.\\nThere was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.\\n\"After all, Watson.\"\\nsaid Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, \"I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.\\nIf Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse.\\nI suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.\\nThis fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.\\nSend him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life.\\nBesides, it is the season of forgiveness.\\nChance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward.\\nIf you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief feature.\"\\nVIII.\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND  On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.\\nOf all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.\\nThe events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street.\\nIt is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given.\\nIt is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr.\\nGrimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.\\nIt was early in April in the year \\'83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed.\\nHe was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\\n\"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson.\"\\nsaid he, \"but it\\'s the common lot this morning.\\nMrs.\\nHudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.\"\\n\"What is it, then--a fire?\"\\n\"No; a client.\\nIt seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me.\\nShe is waiting now in the sitting-room.\\nNow, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate.\\nShould it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset.\\nI thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.\"\\n\"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\"\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him.\\nI rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room.\\nA lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\n\"Good-morning, madam.\"\\nsaid Holmes cheerily.\\n\"My name is Sherlock Holmes.\\nThis is my intimate friend and associate, Dr.\\nWatson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.\\nHa!\\nI am glad to see that Mrs.\\nHudson has had the good sense to light the fire.\\nPray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\"\\n\"It is not cold which makes me shiver.\"\\nsaid the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.\\n\"What, then?\"\\n\"It is fear, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nIt is terror.\"\\nShe raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal.\\nHer features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.\\nSherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\\n\"You must not fear.\"\\nsaid he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm.\\n\"We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.\\nYou have come in by train this morning, I see.\"\\n\"You know me, then?\"\\n\"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove.\\nYou must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.\"\\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.\\n\"There is no mystery, my dear madam.\"\\nsaid he, smiling.\\n\"The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places.\\nThe marks are perfectly fresh.\\nThere is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.\"\\n\"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo.\\nSir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.\\nI have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid.\\nI have heard of you, Mr.\\nHolmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.\\nFarintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need.\\nIt was from her that I had your address.\\nOh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me?\\nAt present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful.\"\\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.\\n\"Farintosh.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara.\\nI think it was before your time, Watson.\\nI can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend.\\nAs to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best.\\nAnd now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.\"\\n\"Alas.\"\\nreplied our visitor, \"the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman.\\nHe does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes.\\nBut I have heard, Mr.\\nHolmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart.\\nYou may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\"\\n\"I am all attention, madam.\"\\n\"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\"\\nHolmes nodded his head.\\n\"The name is familiar to me.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west.\\nIn the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.\\nNothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage.\\nThe last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.\\nIn a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence.\\nAs it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\\n\"When Dr.\\nRoylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs.\\nStoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.\\nMy sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother\\'s re-marriage.\\nShe had a considerable sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr.\\nRoylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage.\\nShortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe.\\nDr.\\nRoylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran.\\nThe money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\\n\"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.\\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path.\\nViolence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather\\'s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics.\\nA series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\n\"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure.\\nHe had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end.\\nHe has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.\\n\"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives.\\nNo servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house.\\nShe was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.\"\\n\"Your sister is dead, then?\"\\n\"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you.\\nYou can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position.\\nWe had, however, an aunt, my mother\\'s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady\\'s house.\\nJulia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged.\\nMy stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\"\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.\\n\"Pray be precise as to details.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory.\\nThe manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited.\\nThe bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings.\\nOf these bedrooms the first is Dr.\\nRoylott\\'s, the second my sister\\'s, and the third my own.\\nThere is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor.\\nDo I make myself plain?\"\\n\"Perfectly so.\"\\n\"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn.\\nThat fatal night Dr.\\nRoylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke.\\nShe left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding.\\nAt eleven o\\'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\\n\"\\'Tell me, Helen,\\' said she, \\'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?\\'\\n\"\\'Never,\\' said I.\\n\"\\'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?\\'\\n\"\\'Certainly not.\\nBut why?\\'\\n\"\\'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle.\\nI am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me.\\nI cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn.\\nI thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.\\'\\n\"\\'No, I have not.\\nIt must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.\\'\\n\"\\'Very likely.\\nAnd yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.\\'\\n\"\\'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\\'\\n\"\\'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\\' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.\"\\n\"Indeed.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?\"\\n\"Always.\"\\n\"And why?\"\\n\"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon.\\nWe had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\"\\n\"Quite so.\\nPray proceed with your statement.\"\\n\"I could not sleep that night.\\nA vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me.\\nMy sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied.\\nIt was a wild night.\\nThe wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows.\\nSuddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman.\\nI knew that it was my sister\\'s voice.\\nI sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor.\\nAs I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\\nAs I ran down the passage, my sister\\'s door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges.\\nI stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it.\\nBy the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.\\nI ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.\\nShe writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed.\\nAt first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, \\'Oh, my God!\\nHelen!\\nIt was the band!\\nThe speckled band!\\' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor\\'s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words.\\nI rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown.\\nWhen he reached my sister\\'s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness.\\nSuch was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\"\\n\"One moment.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound?\\nCould you swear to it?\"\\n\"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry.\\nIt is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\"\\n\"Was your sister dressed?\"\\n\"No, she was in her night-dress.\\nIn her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\"\\n\"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place.\\nThat is important.\\nAnd what conclusions did the coroner come to?\"\\n\"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr.\\nRoylott\\'s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death.\\nMy evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night.\\nThe walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result.\\nThe chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples.\\nIt is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.\\nBesides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\"\\n\"How about poison?\"\\n\"The doctors examined her for it, but without success.\"\\n\"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\"\\n\"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\"\\n\"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\"\\n\"Yes, there are nearly always some there.\"\\n\"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?\"\\n\"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation.\\nI do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used.\"\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\n\"These are very deep waters.\"\\nsaid he; \"pray go on with your narrative.\"\\n\"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever.\\nA month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage.\\nHis name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr.\\nArmitage, of Crane Water, near Reading.\\nMy stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring.\\nTwo days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.\\nImagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.\\nI sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room.\\nI was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice.\"\\n\"You have done wisely.\"\\nsaid my friend.\\n\"But have you told me all?\"\\n\"Yes, all.\"\\n\"Miss Roylott, you have not.\\nYou are screening your stepfather.\"\\n\"Why, what do you mean?\"\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor\\'s knee.\\nFive little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\n\"You have been cruelly used.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist.\\n\"He is a hard man.\"\\nshe said, \"and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\"\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\\n\"This is a very deep business.\"\\nhe said at last.\\n\"There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action.\\nYet we have not a moment to lose.\\nIf we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?\"\\n\"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business.\\nIt is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you.\\nWe have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.\"\\n\"Excellent.\\nYou are not averse to this trip, Watson?\"\\n\"By no means.\"\\n\"Then we shall both come.\\nWhat are you going to do yourself?\"\\n\"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town.\\nBut I shall return by the twelve o\\'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.\"\\n\"And you may expect us early in the afternoon.\\nI have myself some small business matters to attend to.\\nWill you not wait and breakfast?\"\\n\"No, I must go.\\nMy heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you.\\nI shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon.\"\\nShe dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.\\n\"And what do you think of it all, Watson?\"\\nasked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.\\n\"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\"\\n\"Dark enough and sinister enough.\"\\n\"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end.\"\\n\"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?\"\\n\"I cannot think.\"\\n\"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter\\'s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines.\"\\n\"But what, then, did the gipsies do?\"\\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\\n\"I see many objections to any such theory.\"\\n\"And so do I.\\nIt is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day.\\nI want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away.\\nBut what in the name of the devil.\"\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture.\\nHis costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.\\nSo tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.\\nA large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\\n\"Which of you is Holmes?\"\\nasked this apparition.\\n\"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me.\"\\nsaid my companion quietly.\\n\"I am Dr.\\nGrimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\"\\n\"Indeed, Doctor.\"\\nsaid Holmes blandly.\\n\"Pray take a seat.\"\\n\"I will do nothing of the kind.\\nMy stepdaughter has been here.\\nI have traced her.\\nWhat has she been saying to you?\"\\n\"It is a little cold for the time of the year.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"What has she been saying to you?\"\\nscreamed the old man furiously.\\n\"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well.\"\\ncontinued my companion imperturbably.\\n\"Ha!\\nYou put me off, do you?\"\\nsaid our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop.\\n\"I know you, you scoundrel!\\nI have heard of you before.\\nYou are Holmes, the meddler.\"\\nMy friend smiled.\\n\"Holmes, the busybody.\"\\nHis smile broadened.\\n\"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office.\"\\nHolmes chuckled heartily.\\n\"Your conversation is most entertaining.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\"\\n\"I will go when I have said my say.\\nDon\\'t you dare to meddle with my affairs.\\nI know that Miss Stoner has been here.\\nI traced her!\\nI am a dangerous man to fall foul of!\\nSee here.\"\\nHe stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\n\"See that you keep yourself out of my grip.\"\\nhe snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\\n\"He seems a very amiable person.\"\\nsaid Holmes, laughing.\\n\"I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\"\\nAs he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\\n\"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force!\\nThis incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her.\\nAnd now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\\' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.\"\\nIt was nearly one o\\'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion.\\nHe held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.\\n\"I have seen the will of the deceased wife.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned.\\nThe total income, which at the time of the wife\\'s death was little short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750 pounds.\\nEach daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage.\\nIt is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.\\nMy morning\\'s work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort.\\nAnd now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo.\\nI should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket.\\nAn Eley\\'s No.\\n2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots.\\nThat and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\"\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes.\\nIt was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.\\nThe trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth.\\nTo me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged.\\nMy companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.\\nSuddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\\n\"Look there.\"\\nsaid he.\\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point.\\nFrom amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\n\"Stoke Moran?\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr.\\nGrimesby Roylott.\"\\nremarked the driver.\\n\"There is some building going on there.\"\\nsaid Holmes; \"that is where we are going.\"\\n\"There\\'s the village.\"\\nsaid the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; \"but if you want to get to the house, you\\'ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields.\\nThere it is, where the lady is walking.\"\\n\"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner.\"\\nobserved Holmes, shading his eyes.\\n\"Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\"\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.\\n\"I thought it as well.\"\\nsaid Holmes as we climbed the stile, \"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business.\\nIt may stop his gossip.\\nGood-afternoon, Miss Stoner.\\nYou see that we have been as good as our word.\"\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy.\\n\"I have been waiting so eagerly for you.\"\\nshe cried, shaking hands with us warmly.\\n\"All has turned out splendidly.\\nDr.\\nRoylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.\"\\n\"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor\\'s acquaintance.\"\\nsaid Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred.\\nMiss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\n\"Good heavens.\"\\nshe cried, \"he has followed me, then.\"\\n\"So it appears.\"\\n\"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him.\\nWhat will he say when he returns?\"\\n\"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track.\\nYou must lock yourself up from him to-night.\\nIf he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\\'s at Harrow.\\nNow, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine.\"\\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side.\\nIn one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin.\\nThe central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.\\nSome scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit.\\nHolmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.\\n\"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister\\'s, and the one next to the main building to Dr.\\nRoylott\\'s chamber?\"\\n\"Exactly so.\\nBut I am now sleeping in the middle one.\"\\n\"Pending the alterations, as I understand.\\nBy the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\"\\n\"There were none.\\nI believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.\"\\n\"Ah!\\nthat is suggestive.\\nNow, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open.\\nThere are windows in it, of course?\"\\n\"Yes, but very small ones.\\nToo narrow for anyone to pass through.\"\\n\"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side.\\nNow, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?\"\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success.\\nThere was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar.\\nThen with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry.\\n\"Hum.\"\\nsaid he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, \"my theory certainly presents some difficulties.\\nNo one could pass these shutters if they were bolted.\\nWell, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.\"\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened.\\nHolmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate.\\nIt was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses.\\nA brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window.\\nThese articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre.\\nThe boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house.\\nHolmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\\n\"Where does that bell communicate with?\"\\nhe asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.\\n\"It goes to the housekeeper\\'s room.\"\\n\"It looks newer than the other things?\"\\n\"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\"\\n\"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?\"\\n\"No, I never heard of her using it.\\nWe used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.\"\\n\"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.\\nYou will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.\"\\nHe threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards.\\nThen he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled.\\nFinally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.\\nFinally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\\n\"Why, it\\'s a dummy.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Won\\'t it ring?\"\\n\"No, it is not even attached to a wire.\\nThis is very interesting.\\nYou can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.\"\\n\"How very absurd!\\nI never noticed that before.\"\\n\"Very strange.\"\\nmuttered Holmes, pulling at the rope.\\n\"There are one or two very singular points about this room.\\nFor example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air.\"\\n\"That is also quite modern.\"\\nsaid the lady.\\n\"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?\"\\nremarked Holmes.\\n\"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\"\\n\"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate.\\nWith your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.\"\\nDr.\\nGrimesby Roylott\\'s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished.\\nA camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\\nHolmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.\\n\"What\\'s in here?\"\\nhe asked, tapping the safe.\\n\"My stepfather\\'s business papers.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nyou have seen inside, then?\"\\n\"Only once, some years ago.\\nI remember that it was full of papers.\"\\n\"There isn\\'t a cat in it, for example?\"\\n\"No.\\nWhat a strange idea.\"\\n\"Well, look at this.\"\\nHe took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.\\n\"No; we don\\'t keep a cat.\\nBut there is a cheetah and a baboon.\"\\n\"Ah, yes, of course!\\nWell, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.\\nThere is one point which I should wish to determine.\"\\nHe squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.\\n\"Thank you.\\nThat is quite settled.\"\\nsaid he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket.\\n\"Hullo!\\nHere is something interesting.\"\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed.\\nThe lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\\n\"What do you make of that, Watson?\"\\n\"It\\'s a common enough lash.\\nBut I don\\'t know why it should be tied.\"\\n\"That is not quite so common, is it?\\nAh, me!\\nit\\'s a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all.\\nI think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\"\\nI had never seen my friend\\'s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation.\\nWe had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.\\n\"It is very essential, Miss Stoner.\"\\nsaid he, \"that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.\"\\n\"I shall most certainly do so.\"\\n\"The matter is too serious for any hesitation.\\nYour life may depend upon your compliance.\"\\n\"I assure you that I am in your hands.\"\\n\"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room.\"\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\n\"Yes, it must be so.\\nLet me explain.\\nI believe that that is the village inn over there?\"\\n\"Yes, that is the Crown.\"\\n\"Very good.\\nYour windows would be visible from there?\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back.\\nThen when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy.\\nI have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\"\\n\"Oh, yes, easily.\"\\n\"The rest you will leave in our hands.\"\\n\"But what will you do?\"\\n\"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\"\\n\"I believe, Mr.\\nHolmes, that you have already made up your mind.\"\\nsaid Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\\'s sleeve.\\n\"Perhaps I have.\"\\n\"Then, for pity\\'s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\\'s death.\"\\n\"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\"\\n\"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright.\"\\n\"No, I do not think so.\\nI think that there was probably some more tangible cause.\\nAnd now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.\\nRoylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.\\nGood-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\"\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn.\\nThey were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House.\\nAt dusk we saw Dr.\\nGrimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him.\\nThe boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor\\'s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.\\nThe trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\n\"Do you know, Watson.\"\\nsaid Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, \"I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night.\\nThere is a distinct element of danger.\"\\n\"Can I be of assistance?\"\\n\"Your presence might be invaluable.\"\\n\"Then I shall certainly come.\"\\n\"It is very kind of you.\"\\n\"You speak of danger.\\nYou have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.\"\\n\"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more.\\nI imagine that you saw all that I did.\"\\n\"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\"\\n\"You saw the ventilator, too?\"\\n\"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms.\\nIt was so small that a rat could hardly pass through.\"\\n\"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.\"\\n\"My dear Holmes.\"\\n\"Oh, yes, I did.\\nYou remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr.\\nRoylott\\'s cigar.\\nNow, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms.\\nIt could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\\'s inquiry.\\nI deduced a ventilator.\"\\n\"But what harm can there be in that?\"\\n\"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates.\\nA ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies.\\nDoes not that strike you?\"\\n\"I cannot as yet see any connection.\"\\n\"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"It was clamped to the floor.\\nDid you ever see a bed fastened like that before?\"\\n\"I cannot say that I have.\"\\n\"The lady could not move her bed.\\nIt must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\"\\n\"Holmes.\"\\nI cried, \"I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.\\nWe are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\"\\n\"Subtle enough and horrible enough.\\nWhen a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals.\\nHe has nerve and he has knowledge.\\nPalmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.\\nThis man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still.\\nBut we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness\\' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful.\"\\nAbout nine o\\'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House.\\nTwo hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\\n\"That is our signal.\"\\nsaid Holmes, springing to his feet; \"it comes from the middle window.\"\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there.\\nA moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.\\nMaking our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\\n\"My God.\"\\nI whispered; \"did you see it?\"\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I.\\nHis hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.\\nThen he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.\\n\"It is a nice household.\"\\nhe murmured.\\n\"That is the baboon.\"\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected.\\nThere was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment.\\nI confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes\\' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom.\\nMy companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room.\\nAll was as we had seen it in the daytime.\\nThen creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:  \"The least sound would be fatal to our plans.\"\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\n\"We must sit without light.\\nHe would see it through the ventilator.\"\\nI nodded again.\\n\"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it.\\nHave your pistol ready in case we should need it.\\nI will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.\"\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him.\\nBy it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\\nThen he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?\\nI could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.\\nThe shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty.\\nFar away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour.\\nHow long they seemed, those quarters!\\nTwelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.\\nSomeone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.\\nI heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger.\\nFor half an hour I sat with straining ears.\\nThen suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.\\nThe instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.\\n\"You see it, Watson?\"\\nhe yelled.\\n\"You see it?\"\\nBut I saw nothing.\\nAt the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely.\\nI could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing.\\nHe had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened.\\nIt swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek.\\nThey say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds.\\nIt struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\\n\"What can it mean?\"\\nI gasped.\\n\"It means that it is all over.\"\\nHolmes answered.\\n\"And perhaps, after all, it is for the best.\\nTake your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\\nRoylott\\'s room.\"\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\\nTwice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.\\nThen he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes.\\nOn the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.\\nBeside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr.\\nGrimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.\\nAcross his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.\\nHis chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.\\nRound his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head.\\nAs we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\\n\"The band!\\nthe speckled band.\"\\nwhispered Holmes.\\nI took a step forward.\\nIn an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\n\"It is a swamp adder.\"\\ncried Holmes; \"the deadliest snake in India.\\nHe has died within ten seconds of being bitten.\\nViolence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.\\nLet us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.\"\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\\'s lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile\\'s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm\\'s length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr.\\nGrimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\\nIt is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet.\\nThe little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\\n\"I had.\"\\nsaid he, \"come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data.\\nThe presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word \\'band,\\' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent.\\nI can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.\\nMy attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.\\nThe discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\\nThe idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.\\nThe idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.\\nThe rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage.\\nIt would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.\\nThen I thought of the whistle.\\nOf course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.\\nHe had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.\\nHe would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed.\\nIt might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\\n\"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.\\nAn inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator.\\nThe sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained.\\nThe metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.\\nHaving once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.\\nI heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.\"\\n\"With the result of driving it through the ventilator.\"\\n\"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side.\\nSome of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw.\\nIn this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.\\nGrimesby Roylott\\'s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience.\"\\nIX.\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER\\'S THUMB  Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice--that of Mr.\\nHatherley\\'s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\\'s madness.\\nOf these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results.\\nThe story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth.\\nAt the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.\\nIt was in the summer of \\'89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise.\\nI had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us.\\nMy practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials.\\nOne of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o\\'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room.\\nI dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs.\\nAs I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\\n\"I\\'ve got him here.\"\\nhe whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; \"he\\'s all right.\"\\n\"What is it, then?\"\\nI asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.\\n\"It\\'s a new patient.\"\\nhe whispered.\\n\"I thought I\\'d bring him round myself; then he couldn\\'t slip away.\\nThere he is, all safe and sound.\\nI must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.\"\\nAnd off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.\\nHe was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books.\\nRound one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains.\\nHe was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\\n\"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor.\"\\nsaid he, \"but I have had a very serious accident during the night.\\nI came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.\\nI gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\"\\nI took it up and glanced at it.\\n\"Mr.\\nVictor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\"\\nThat was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor.\\n\"I regret that I have kept you waiting.\"\\nsaid I, sitting down in my library-chair.\\n\"You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation.\"\\n\"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous.\"\\nsaid he, and laughed.\\nHe laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides.\\nAll my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.\\n\"Stop it.\"\\nI cried; \"pull yourself together.\"\\nand I poured out some water from a caraffe.\\nIt was useless, however.\\nHe was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone.\\nPresently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.\\n\"I have been making a fool of myself.\"\\nhe gasped.\\n\"Not at all.\\nDrink this.\"\\nI dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\\n\"That\\'s better.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\"\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand.\\nIt gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it.\\nThere were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been.\\nIt had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\\n\"Good heavens.\"\\nI cried, \"this is a terrible injury.\\nIt must have bled considerably.\"\\n\"Yes, it did.\\nI fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time.\\nWhen I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig.\"\\n\"Excellent!\\nYou should have been a surgeon.\"\\n\"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.\"\\n\"This has been done.\"\\nsaid I, examining the wound, \"by a very heavy and sharp instrument.\"\\n\"A thing like a cleaver.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"An accident, I presume?\"\\n\"By no means.\"\\n\"What!\\na murderous attack?\"\\n\"Very murderous indeed.\"\\n\"You horrify me.\"\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages.\\nHe lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\\n\"How is that?\"\\nI asked when I had finished.\\n\"Capital!\\nBetween your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.\\nI was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\"\\n\"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter.\\nIt is evidently trying to your nerves.\"\\n\"Oh, no, not now.\\nI shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done.\"\\n\"Ha.\"\\ncried I, \"if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr.\\nSherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.\"\\n\"Oh, I have heard of that fellow.\"\\nanswered my visitor, \"and I should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well.\\nWould you give me an introduction to him?\"\\n\"I\\'ll do better.\\nI\\'ll take you round to him myself.\"\\n\"I should be immensely obliged to you.\"\\n\"We\\'ll call a cab and go together.\\nWe shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him.\\nDo you feel equal to it?\"\\n\"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\"\\n\"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.\"\\nI rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street.\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece.\\nHe received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.\\nWhen it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach.\\n\"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\nHatherley.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home.\\nTell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.\"\\n\"Thank you.\"\\nsaid my patient, \"but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the cure.\\nI shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\"\\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us.\\n\"You must know.\"\\nsaid he, \"that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London.\\nBy profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich.\\nTwo years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father\\'s death, I determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.\\n\"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience.\\nTo me it has been exceptionally so.\\nDuring two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me.\\nMy gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s.\\nEvery day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.\\n\"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business.\\nHe brought up a card, too, with the name of \\'Colonel Lysander Stark\\' engraved upon it.\\nClose at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness.\\nI do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man.\\nHis whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones.\\nYet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured.\\nHe was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.\\n\"\\'Mr.\\nHatherley?\\' said he, with something of a German accent.\\n\\'You have been recommended to me, Mr.\\nHatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret.\\'\\n\"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address.\\n\\'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\\'\\n\"\\'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment.\\nI have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\\'\\n\"\\'That is quite correct,\\' I answered; \\'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications.\\nI understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?\\'\\n\"\\'Undoubtedly so.\\nBut you will find that all I say is really to the point.\\nI have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family.\\'\\n\"\\'If I promise to keep a secret,\\' said I, \\'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.\\'\\n\"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\\n\"\\'Do you promise, then?\\' said he at last.\\n\"\\'Yes, I promise.\\'\\n\"\\'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after?\\nNo reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?\\'\\n\"\\'I have already given you my word.\\'\\n\"\\'Very good.\\' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door.\\nThe passage outside was empty.\\n\"\\'That\\'s all right,\\' said he, coming back.\\n\\'I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master\\'s affairs.\\nNow we can talk in safety.\\' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\\n\"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.\\nEven my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.\\n\"\\'I beg that you will state your business, sir,\\' said I; \\'my time is of value.\\' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.\\n\"\\'How would fifty guineas for a night\\'s work suit you?\\' he asked.\\n\"\\'Most admirably.\\'\\n\"\\'I say a night\\'s work, but an hour\\'s would be nearer the mark.\\nI simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear.\\nIf you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves.\\nWhat do you think of such a commission as that?\\'\\n\"\\'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\\'\\n\"\\'Precisely so.\\nWe shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\\'\\n\"\\'Where to?\\'\\n\"\\'To Eyford, in Berkshire.\\nIt is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading.\\nThere is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.\\'\\n\"\\'Very good.\\'\\n\"\\'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\\'\\n\"\\'There is a drive, then?\\'\\n\"\\'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country.\\nIt is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.\\'\\n\"\\'Then we can hardly get there before midnight.\\nI suppose there would be no chance of a train back.\\nI should be compelled to stop the night.\\'\\n\"\\'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\\'\\n\"\\'That is very awkward.\\nCould I not come at some more convenient hour?\\'\\n\"\\'We have judged it best that you should come late.\\nIt is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession.\\nStill, of course, if you would like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do so.\\'\\n\"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me.\\n\\'Not at all,\\' said I, \\'I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes.\\nI should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\\'\\n\"\\'Quite so.\\nIt is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity.\\nI have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you.\\nI suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\\'\\n\"\\'Entirely.\\'\\n\"\\'Then the matter stands thus.\\nYou are probably aware that fuller\\'s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one or two places in England?\\'\\n\"\\'I have heard so.\\'\\n\"\\'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading.\\nI was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller\\'s-earth in one of my fields.\\nOn examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours.\\nThese good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine.\\nNaturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this.\\nI took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields.\\nThis we have now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press.\\nThis press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject.\\nWe guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans.\\nThat is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night.\\nI hope that I make it all plain?\\'\\n\"\\'I quite follow you,\\' said I.\\n\\'The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller\\'s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.\\'\\n\"\\'Ah!\\' said he carelessly, \\'we have our own process.\\nWe compress the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are.\\nBut that is a mere detail.\\nI have taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr.\\nHatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\\' He rose as he spoke.\\n\\'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.\\'\\n\"\\'I shall certainly be there.\\'\\n\"\\'And not a word to a soul.\\' He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.\\n\"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me.\\nOn the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones.\\nOn the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller\\'s-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand.\\nHowever, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\n\"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.\\nHowever, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o\\'clock.\\nI was the only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern.\\nAs I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side.\\nWithout a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing open.\\nHe drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the horse could go.\"\\n\"One horse?\"\\ninterjected Holmes.\\n\"Yes, only one.\"\\n\"Did you observe the colour?\"\\n\"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage.\\nIt was a chestnut.\"\\n\"Tired-looking or fresh?\"\\n\"Oh, fresh and glossy.\"\\n\"Thank you.\\nI am sorry to have interrupted you.\\nPray continue your most interesting statement.\"\\n\"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour.\\nColonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve.\\nHe sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great intensity.\\nThe country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly.\\nI tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light.\\nNow and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged.\\nAt last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand.\\nColonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us.\\nWe stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house.\\nThe instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away.\\n\"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.\\nSuddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction.\\nIt grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.\\nI could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material.\\nShe spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand.\\nColonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\\n\"\\'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,\\' said he, throwing open another door.\\nIt was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which several German books were scattered.\\nColonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door.\\n\\'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,\\' said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\n\"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry.\\nThen I walked across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it.\\nIt was a wonderfully silent house.\\nThere was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still.\\nA vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me.\\nWho were these German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place?\\nAnd where was the place?\\nI was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea.\\nFor that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all.\\nYet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the country.\\nI paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\\n\"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open.\\nThe woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face.\\nI could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart.\\nShe held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.\\n\"\\'I would go,\\' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; \\'I would go.\\nI should not stay here.\\nThere is no good for you to do.\\'\\n\"\\'But, madam,\\' said I, \\'I have not yet done what I came for.\\nI cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.\\'\\n\"\\'It is not worth your while to wait,\\' she went on.\\n\\'You can pass through the door; no one hinders.\\' And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together.\\n\\'For the love of Heaven!\\' she whispered, \\'get away from here before it is too late!\\'\\n\"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way.\\nI thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me.\\nWas it all to go for nothing?\\nWhy should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due?\\nThis woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac.\\nWith a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was.\\nShe was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs.\\nShe listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.\\n\"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr.\\nFerguson.\\n\"\\'This is my secretary and manager,\\' said the colonel.\\n\\'By the way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now.\\nI fear that you have felt the draught.\\'\\n\"\\'On the contrary,\\' said I, \\'I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.\\'\\n\"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me.\\n\\'Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,\\' said he.\\n\\'Mr.\\nFerguson and I will take you up to see the machine.\\'\\n\"\\'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\\'\\n\"\\'Oh, no, it is in the house.\\'\\n\"\\'What, you dig fuller\\'s-earth in the house?\\'\\n\"\\'No, no.\\nThis is only where we compress it.\\nBut never mind that.\\nAll we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.\\'\\n\"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him.\\nIt was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them.\\nThere were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches.\\nI tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two companions.\\nFerguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.\\n\"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked.\\nWithin was a small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time.\\nFerguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in.\\n\"\\'We are now,\\' said he, \\'actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on.\\nThe ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor.\\nThere are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you.\\nThe machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little of its force.\\nPerhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right.\\'\\n\"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.\\nIt was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure.\\nWhen I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders.\\nAn examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked.\\nThis was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right.\\nWhen I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.\\nIt was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\\'s-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose.\\nThe walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it.\\nI had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me.\\n\"\\'What are you doing there?\\' he asked.\\n\"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me.\\n\\'I was admiring your fuller\\'s-earth,\\' said I; \\'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\\'\\n\"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech.\\nHis face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.\\n\"\\'Very well,\\' said he, \\'you shall know all about the machine.\\' He took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the lock.\\nI rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.\\n\\'Hullo!\\' I yelled.\\n\\'Hullo!\\nColonel!\\nLet me out!\\'\\n\"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth.\\nIt was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder.\\nHe had set the engine at work.\\nThe lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough.\\nBy its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp.\\nI threw myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock.\\nI implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries.\\nThe ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\\nThen it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it.\\nIf I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap.\\nEasier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?\\nAlready I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\n\"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood.\\nAs I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward.\\nFor an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.\\nThe next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side.\\nThe panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.\\n\"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a candle in her right.\\nIt was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\\n\"\\'Come!\\ncome!\\' she cried breathlessly.\\n\\'They will be here in a moment.\\nThey will see that you are not there.\\nOh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!\\'\\n\"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice.\\nI staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair.\\nThe latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath.\\nMy guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit\\'s end.\\nThen she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.\\n\"\\'It is your only chance,\\' said she.\\n\\'It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.\\'\\n\"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\\'s cleaver in the other.\\nI rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out.\\nHow quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down.\\nI clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me.\\nIf she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.\\nThe thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.\\n\"\\'Fritz!\\nFritz!\\' she cried in English, \\'remember your promise after the last time.\\nYou said it should not be again.\\nHe will be silent!\\nOh, he will be silent!\\'\\n\"\\'You are mad, Elise!\\' he shouted, struggling to break away from her.\\n\\'You will be the ruin of us.\\nHe has seen too much.\\nLet me pass, I say!\\' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with his heavy weapon.\\nI had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell.\\nI was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.\\n\"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet.\\nSuddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.\\nI glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound.\\nI endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.\\n\"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell.\\nIt must have been a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself.\\nMy clothes were all sodden with dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.\\nThe smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night\\'s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers.\\nBut to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen.\\nI had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.\\nWere it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\\n\"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour.\\nThe same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived.\\nI inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark.\\nThe name was strange to him.\\nHad he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me?\\nNo, he had not.\\nWas there a police-station anywhere near?\\nThere was one about three miles off.\\n\"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was.\\nI determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police.\\nIt was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here.\\nI put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.\"\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative.\\nThen Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.\\n\"Here is an advertisement which will interest you.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"It appeared in all the papers about a year ago.\\nListen to this: \\'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr.\\nJeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer.\\nLeft his lodgings at ten o\\'clock at night, and has not been heard of since.\\nWas dressed in,\\' etc., etc.\\nHa!\\nThat represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy.\"\\n\"Good heavens.\"\\ncried my patient.\\n\"Then that explains what the girl said.\"\\n\"Undoubtedly.\\nIt is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship.\\nWell, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\"\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.\\nThere were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.\\nBradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\\n\"There you are.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village.\\nThe place we want must be somewhere near that line.\\nYou said ten miles, I think, sir.\"\\n\"It was an hour\\'s good drive.\"\\n\"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?\"\\n\"They must have done so.\\nI have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere.\"\\n\"What I cannot understand.\"\\nsaid I, \"is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.\\nPerhaps the villain was softened by the woman\\'s entreaties.\"\\n\"I hardly think that likely.\\nI never saw a more inexorable face in my life.\"\\n\"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that.\"\\nsaid Bradstreet.\\n\"Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found.\"\\n\"I think I could lay my finger on it.\"\\nsaid Holmes quietly.\\n\"Really, now.\"\\ncried the inspector, \"you have formed your opinion!\\nCome, now, we shall see who agrees with you.\\nI say it is south, for the country is more deserted there.\"\\n\"And I say east.\"\\nsaid my patient.\\n\"I am for west.\"\\nremarked the plain-clothes man.\\n\"There are several quiet little villages up there.\"\\n\"And I am for north.\"\\nsaid I, \"because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.\"\\n\"Come.\"\\ncried the inspector, laughing; \"it\\'s a very pretty diversity of opinion.\\nWe have boxed the compass among us.\\nWho do you give your casting vote to?\"\\n\"You are all wrong.\"\\n\"But we can\\'t all be.\"\\n\"Oh, yes, you can.\\nThis is my point.\"\\nHe placed his finger in the centre of the circle.\\n\"This is where we shall find them.\"\\n\"But the twelve-mile drive?\"\\ngasped Hatherley.\\n\"Six out and six back.\\nNothing simpler.\\nYou say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in.\\nHow could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?\"\\n\"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough.\"\\nobserved Bradstreet thoughtfully.\\n\"Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.\"\\n\"None at all.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver.\"\\n\"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work.\"\\nsaid the inspector.\\n\"They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand.\\nWe even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands.\\nBut now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough.\"\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice.\\nAs we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\\n\"A house on fire?\"\\nasked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\nsaid the station-master.\\n\"When did it break out?\"\\n\"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze.\"\\n\"Whose house is it?\"\\n\"Dr.\\nBecher\\'s.\"\\n\"Tell me.\"\\nbroke in the engineer, \"is Dr.\\nBecher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?\"\\nThe station-master laughed heartily.\\n\"No, sir, Dr.\\nBecher is an Englishman, and there isn\\'t a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat.\\nBut he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm.\"\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire.\\nThe road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\ncried Hatherley, in intense excitement.\\n\"There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.\\nThat second window is the one that I jumped from.\"\\n\"Well, at least.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"you have had your revenge upon them.\\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\\nNow keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\"\\nAnd Holmes\\' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman.\\nEarly that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\\' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.\\nAbout sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly.\\nLarge masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale.\\nHe had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones.\\nOn the whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\\n\"Well.\"\\nsaid our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, \"it has been a pretty business for me!\\nI have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\"\\n\"Experience.\"\\nsaid Holmes, laughing.\\n\"Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\"\\nX.\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR  The Lord St.\\nSimon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves.\\nFresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama.\\nAs I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode.\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him.\\nI had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.\\nWith my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\\'s noble correspondent could be.\\n\"Here is a very fashionable epistle.\"\\nI remarked as he entered.\\n\"Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.\"\\n\"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety.\"\\nhe answered, smiling, \"and the humbler are usually the more interesting.\\nThis looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.\"\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\n\"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\"\\n\"Not social, then?\"\\n\"No, distinctly professional.\"\\n\"And from a noble client?\"\\n\"One of the highest in England.\"\\n\"My dear fellow, I congratulate you.\"\\n\"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.\\nIt is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation.\\nYou have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?\"\\n\"It looks like it.\"\\nsaid I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner.\\n\"I have had nothing else to do.\"\\n\"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up.\\nI read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column.\\nThe latter is always instructive.\\nBut if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about Lord St.\\nSimon and his wedding?\"\\n\"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.\"\\n\"That is well.\\nThe letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.\\nSimon.\\nI will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.\\nThis is what he says:  \"\\'MY DEAR MR.\\nSHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion.\\nI have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding.\\nMr.\\nLestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance.\\nI will call at four o\\'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount importance.\\nYours faithfully, ST.\\nSIMON.\\'\\n\"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger.\"\\nremarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle.\\n\"He says four o\\'clock.\\nIt is three now.\\nHe will be here in an hour.\"\\n\"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject.\\nTurn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.\"\\nHe picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece.\\n\"Here he is.\"\\nsaid he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee.\\n\"\\'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St.\\nSimon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.\\' Hum!\\n\\'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable.\\nBorn in 1846.\\' He\\'s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage.\\nWas Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration.\\nThe Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.\\nThey inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side.\\nHa!\\nWell, there is nothing very instructive in all this.\\nI think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.\"\\n\"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want.\"\\nsaid I, \"for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable.\\nI feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.\"\\n\"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.\\nThat is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first.\\nPray give me the results of your newspaper selections.\"\\n\"Here is the first notice which I can find.\\nIt is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks back: \\'A marriage has been arranged,\\' it says, \\'and will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St.\\nSimon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran.\\nEsq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.\\' That is all.\"\\n\"Terse and to the point.\"\\nremarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.\\n\"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week.\\nAh, here it is: \\'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product.\\nOne by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic.\\nAn important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders.\\nLord St.\\nSimon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god\\'s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire.\\nMiss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.\\nAs it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St.\\nSimon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress..\"\\n\"Anything else?\"\\nasked Holmes, yawning.\\n\"Oh, yes; plenty.\\nThen there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St.\\nGeorge\\'s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr.\\nAloysius Doran.\\nTwo days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater\\'s place, near Petersfield.\\nThose are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.\"\\n\"Before the what?\"\\nasked Holmes with a start.\\n\"The vanishing of the lady.\"\\n\"When did she vanish, then?\"\\n\"At the wedding breakfast.\"\\n\"Indeed.\\nThis is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.\"\\n\"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.\"\\n\"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.\\nPray let me have the details.\"\\n\"I warn you that they are very incomplete.\"\\n\"Perhaps we may make them less so.\"\\n\"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you.\\nIt is headed, \\'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding\\':  \"\\'The family of Lord Robert St.\\nSimon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding.\\nThe ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about.\\nIn spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\\n\"\\'The ceremony, which was performed at St.\\nGeorge\\'s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr.\\nAloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St.\\nSimon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington.\\nThe whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr.\\nAloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared.\\nIt appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St.\\nSimon.\\nIt was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman.\\nThe bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.\\nHer prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage.\\nOne of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company.\\nOn ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr.\\nAloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.\\nUp to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady.\\nThere are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride..\"\\n\"And is that all?\"\\n\"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.\"\\n\"And it is-.\"\\n\"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested.\\nIt appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.\\nThere are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press.\"\\n\"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be.\\nI would not have missed it for worlds.\\nBut there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client.\\nDo not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.\"\\n\"Lord Robert St.\\nSimon.\"\\nannounced our page-boy, throwing open the door.\\nA gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed.\\nHis manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked.\\nHis hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top.\\nAs to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.\\nHe advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses.\\n\"Good-day, Lord St.\\nSimon.\"\\nsaid Holmes, rising and bowing.\\n\"Pray take the basket-chair.\\nThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\nWatson.\\nDraw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.\"\\n\"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nI have been cut to the quick.\\nI understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.\"\\n\"No, I am descending.\"\\n\"I beg pardon.\"\\n\"My last client of the sort was a king.\"\\n\"Oh, really!\\nI had no idea.\\nAnd which king?\"\\n\"The King of Scandinavia.\"\\n\"What!\\nHad he lost his wife?\"\\n\"You can understand.\"\\nsaid Holmes suavely, \"that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in yours.\"\\n\"Of course!\\nVery right!\\nvery right!\\nI\\'m sure I beg pardon.\\nAs to my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion.\"\\n\"Thank you.\\nI have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more.\\nI presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.\"\\nLord St.\\nSimon glanced over it.\\n\"Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.\"\\n\"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion.\\nI think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you.\"\\n\"Pray do so.\"\\n\"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?\"\\n\"In San Francisco, a year ago.\"\\n\"You were travelling in the States?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Did you become engaged then?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"But you were on a friendly footing?\"\\n\"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.\"\\n\"Her father is very rich?\"\\n\"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.\"\\n\"And how did he make his money?\"\\n\"In mining.\\nHe had nothing a few years ago.\\nThen he struck gold, invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.\"\\n\"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady\\'s--your wife\\'s character?\"\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire.\\n\"You see, Mr.\\nHolmes.\"\\nsaid he, \"my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man.\\nDuring that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster.\\nShe is what we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions.\\nShe is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say.\\nShe is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions.\\nOn the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear\"--he gave a little stately cough--\"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman.\\nI believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.\"\\n\"Have you her photograph?\"\\n\"I brought this with me.\"\\nHe opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman.\\nIt was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.\\nHolmes gazed long and earnestly at it.\\nThen he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St.\\nSimon.\\n\"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?\"\\n\"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season.\\nI met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.\"\\n\"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?\"\\n\"A fair dowry.\\nNot more than is usual in my family.\"\\n\"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?\"\\n\"I really have made no inquiries on the subject.\"\\n\"Very naturally not.\\nDid you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Was she in good spirits?\"\\n\"Never better.\\nShe kept talking of what we should do in our future lives.\"\\n\"Indeed!\\nThat is very interesting.\\nAnd on the morning of the wedding?\"\\n\"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony.\"\\n\"And did you observe any change in her then?\"\\n\"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp.\\nThe incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\"\\n\"Pray let us have it, for all that.\"\\n\"Oh, it is childish.\\nShe dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry.\\nShe was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew.\\nThere was a moment\\'s delay, but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall.\\nYet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.\"\\n\"Indeed!\\nYou say that there was a gentleman in the pew.\\nSome of the general public were present, then?\"\\n\"Oh, yes.\\nIt is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\"\\n\"This gentleman was not one of your wife\\'s friends?\"\\n\"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person.\\nI hardly noticed his appearance.\\nBut really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.\"\\n\"Lady St.\\nSimon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it.\\nWhat did she do on re-entering her father\\'s house?\"\\n\"I saw her in conversation with her maid.\"\\n\"And who is her maid?\"\\n\"Alice is her name.\\nShe is an American and came from California with her.\"\\n\"A confidential servant?\"\\n\"A little too much so.\\nIt seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties.\\nStill, of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way.\"\\n\"How long did she speak to this Alice?\"\\n\"Oh, a few minutes.\\nI had something else to think of.\"\\n\"You did not overhear what they said?\"\\n\"Lady St.\\nSimon said something about \\'jumping a claim.\\' She was accustomed to use slang of the kind.\\nI have no idea what she meant.\"\\n\"American slang is very expressive sometimes.\\nAnd what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?\"\\n\"She walked into the breakfast-room.\"\\n\"On your arm?\"\\n\"No, alone.\\nShe was very independent in little matters like that.\\nThen, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room.\\nShe never came back.\"\\n\"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride\\'s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out.\"\\n\"Quite so.\\nAnd she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr.\\nDoran\\'s house that morning.\"\\n\"Ah, yes.\\nI should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her.\"\\nLord St.\\nSimon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.\\n\"We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing.\\nShe used to be at the Allegro.\\nI have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nFlora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me.\\nShe wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church.\\nShe came to Mr.\\nDoran\\'s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.\\nShe was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row.\"\\n\"Did your wife hear all this?\"\\n\"No, thank goodness, she did not.\"\\n\"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\"\\n\"Yes.\\nThat is what Mr.\\nLestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious.\\nIt is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her.\"\\n\"Well, it is a possible supposition.\"\\n\"You think so, too?\"\\n\"I did not say a probable one.\\nBut you do not yourself look upon this as likely?\"\\n\"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\"\\n\"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters.\\nPray what is your own theory as to what took place?\"\\n\"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one.\\nI have given you all the facts.\\nSince you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\"\\n\"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\"\\n\"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\"\\n\"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis.\"\\nsaid Holmes, smiling.\\n\"And now, Lord St.\\nSimon, I think that I have nearly all my data.\\nMay I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?\"\\n\"We could see the other side of the road and the Park.\"\\n\"Quite so.\\nThen I do not think that I need to detain you longer.\\nI shall communicate with you.\"\\n\"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem.\"\\nsaid our client, rising.\\n\"I have solved it.\"\\n\"Eh?\\nWhat was that?\"\\n\"I say that I have solved it.\"\\n\"Where, then, is my wife?\"\\n\"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\"\\nLord St.\\nSimon shook his head.\\n\"I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine.\"\\nhe remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.\\n\"It is very good of Lord St.\\nSimon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own.\"\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes, laughing.\\n\"I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning.\\nI had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room.\"\\n\"My dear Holmes.\"\\n\"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as prompt.\\nMy whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty.\\nCircumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau\\'s example.\"\\n\"But I have heard all that you have heard.\"\\n\"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well.\\nThere was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War.\\nIt is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade!\\nGood-afternoon, Lestrade!\\nYou will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\"\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand.\\nWith a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.\\n\"What\\'s up, then?\"\\nasked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye.\\n\"You look dissatisfied.\"\\n\"And I feel dissatisfied.\\nIt is this infernal St.\\nSimon marriage case.\\nI can make neither head nor tail of the business.\"\\n\"Really!\\nYou surprise me.\"\\n\"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair?\\nEvery clue seems to slip through my fingers.\\nI have been at work upon it all day.\"\\n\"And very wet it seems to have made you.\"\\nsaid Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\n\"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\"\\n\"In heaven\\'s name, what for?\"\\n\"In search of the body of Lady St.\\nSimon.\"\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\n\"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"Why?\\nWhat do you mean?\"\\n\"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.\"\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion.\\n\"I suppose you know all about it.\"\\nhe snarled.\\n\"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\"\\n\"Oh, indeed!\\nThen you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?\"\\n\"I think it very unlikely.\"\\n\"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?\"\\nHe opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride\\'s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water.\\n\"There.\"\\nsaid he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile.\\n\"There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\"\\n\"Oh, indeed.\"\\nsaid my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.\\n\"You dragged them from the Serpentine?\"\\n\"No.\\nThey were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.\\nThey have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.\"\\n\"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man\\'s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe.\\nAnd pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?\"\\n\"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\"\\n\"I am afraid that you will find it difficult.\"\\n\"Are you, indeed, now?\"\\ncried Lestrade with some bitterness.\\n\"I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences.\\nYou have made two blunders in as many minutes.\\nThis dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\"\\n\"And how?\"\\n\"In the dress is a pocket.\\nIn the pocket is a card-case.\\nIn the card-case is a note.\\nAnd here is the very note.\"\\nHe slapped it down upon the table in front of him.\\n\"Listen to this: \\'You will see me when all is ready.\\nCome at once.\\nF.H.M.\\' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St.\\nSimon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.\\nHere, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach.\"\\n\"Very good, Lestrade.\"\\nsaid Holmes, laughing.\\n\"You really are very fine indeed.\\nLet me see it.\"\\nHe took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of satisfaction.\\n\"This is indeed important.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Ha!\\nyou find it so?\"\\n\"Extremely so.\\nI congratulate you warmly.\"\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look.\\n\"Why.\"\\nhe shrieked, \"you\\'re looking at the wrong side.\"\\n\"On the contrary, this is the right side.\"\\n\"The right side?\\nYou\\'re mad!\\nHere is the note written in pencil over here.\"\\n\"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.\"\\n\"There\\'s nothing in it.\\nI looked at it before.\"\\nsaid Lestrade.\\n\"\\'Oct.\\n4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s.\\n6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.\\n6d., glass sherry, 8d.\\' I see nothing in that.\"\\n\"Very likely not.\\nIt is most important, all the same.\\nAs to the note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate you again.\"\\n\"I\\'ve wasted time enough.\"\\nsaid Lestrade, rising.\\n\"I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.\\nGood-day, Mr.\\nHolmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first.\"\\nHe gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.\\n\"Just one hint to you, Lestrade.\"\\ndrawled Holmes before his rival vanished; \"I will tell you the true solution of the matter.\\nLady St.\\nSimon is a myth.\\nThere is not, and there never has been, any such person.\"\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion.\\nThen he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat.\\n\"There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work.\"\\nhe remarked, \"so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little.\"\\nIt was after five o\\'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\\'s man with a very large flat box.\\nThis he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany.\\nThere were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles.\\nHaving laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.\\nJust before nine o\\'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\n\"They have laid the supper, then.\"\\nhe said, rubbing his hands.\\n\"You seem to expect company.\\nThey have laid for five.\"\\n\"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"I am surprised that Lord St.\\nSimon has not already arrived.\\nHa!\\nI fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.\"\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.\\n\"My messenger reached you, then?\"\\nasked Holmes.\\n\"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.\\nHave you good authority for what you say?\"\\n\"The best possible.\"\\nLord St.\\nSimon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\\n\"What will the Duke say.\"\\nhe murmured, \"when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?\"\\n\"It is the purest accident.\\nI cannot allow that there is any humiliation.\"\\n\"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.\"\\n\"I fail to see that anyone is to blame.\\nI can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted.\\nHaving no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis.\"\\n\"It was a slight, sir, a public slight.\"\\nsaid Lord St.\\nSimon, tapping his fingers upon the table.\\n\"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.\"\\n\"I will make no allowance.\\nI am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.\"\\n\"I think that I heard a ring.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Yes, there are steps on the landing.\\nIf I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St.\\nSimon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful.\"\\nHe opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.\\n\"Lord St.\\nSimon.\"\\nsaid he \"allow me to introduce you to Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nFrancis Hay Moulton.\\nThe lady, I think, you have already met.\"\\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity.\\nThe lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes.\\nIt was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\\n\"You\\'re angry, Robert.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"Well, I guess you have every cause to be.\"\\n\"Pray make no apology to me.\"\\nsaid Lord St.\\nSimon bitterly.\\n\"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\\'t know what I was doing or saying.\\nI only wonder I didn\\'t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.\"\\n\"Perhaps, Mrs.\\nMoulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?\"\\n\"If I may give an opinion.\"\\nremarked the strange gentleman, \"we\\'ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already.\\nFor my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\"\\nHe was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.\\n\"Then I\\'ll tell our story right away.\"\\nsaid the lady.\\n\"Frank here and I met in \\'84, in McQuire\\'s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim.\\nWe were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing.\\nThe richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn\\'t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to \\'Frisco.\\nFrank wouldn\\'t throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it.\\nIt would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves.\\nFrank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa.\\nSo then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.\\n\\'Why shouldn\\'t we be married right away, then,\\' said he, \\'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won\\'t claim to be your husband until I come back?\\' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\\n\"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico.\\nAfter that came a long newspaper story about how a miners\\' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\\'s name among the killed.\\nI fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after.\\nPa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \\'Frisco.\\nNot a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead.\\nThen Lord St.\\nSimon came to \\'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\\n\"Still, if I had married Lord St.\\nSimon, of course I\\'d have done my duty by him.\\nWe can\\'t command our love, but we can our actions.\\nI went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be.\\nBut you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew.\\nI thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him.\\nI wonder I didn\\'t drop.\\nI know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear.\\nI didn\\'t know what to do.\\nShould I stop the service and make a scene in the church?\\nI glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still.\\nThen I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note.\\nAs I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers.\\nIt was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.\\nOf course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.\\n\"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his friend.\\nI ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready.\\nI know I ought to have spoken to Lord St.\\nSimon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people.\\nI just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards.\\nI hadn\\'t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road.\\nHe beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.\\nI slipped out, put on my things, and followed him.\\nSome woman came talking something or other about Lord St.\\nSimon to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank.\\nWe got into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting.\\nFrank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \\'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\"\\n\"I saw it in a paper.\"\\nexplained the American.\\n\"It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived.\"\\n\"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive.\\nIt was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back.\\nSo Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them.\\nIt is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr.\\nHolmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret.\\nThen he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St.\\nSimon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once.\\nNow, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me.\"\\nLord St.\\nSimon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.\\n\"Excuse me.\"\\nhe said, \"but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner.\"\\n\"Then you won\\'t forgive me?\\nYou won\\'t shake hands before I go?\"\\n\"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\"\\nHe put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\n\"I had hoped.\"\\nsuggested Holmes, \"that you would have joined us in a friendly supper.\"\\n\"I think that there you ask a little too much.\"\\nresponded his Lordship.\\n\"I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them.\\nI think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\"\\nHe included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\\n\"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company.\"\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes.\\n\"It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr.\\nMoulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.\"\\n\"The case has been an interesting one.\"\\nremarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, \"because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable.\\nNothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.\\nLestrade of Scotland Yard.\"\\n\"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?\"\\n\"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her to change her mind.\\nWhat could that something be?\\nShe could not have spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom.\\nHad she seen someone, then?\\nIf she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely.\\nYou see we have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.\\nThen who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence over her?\\nIt might be a lover; it might be a husband.\\nHer young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions.\\nSo far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.\\nSimon\\'s narrative.\\nWhen he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride\\'s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners\\' parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear.\\nShe had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter.\"\\n\"And how in the world did you find them?\"\\n\"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know.\\nThe initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.\"\\n\"How did you deduce the select?\"\\n\"By the select prices.\\nEight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels.\\nThere are not many in London which charge at that rate.\\nIn the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H.\\nMoulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill.\\nHis letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St.\\nSimon in particular.\\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment.\"\\n\"But with no very good result.\"\\nI remarked.\\n\"His conduct was certainly not very gracious.\"\\n\"Ah, Watson.\"\\nsaid Holmes, smiling, \"perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune.\\nI think that we may judge Lord St.\\nSimon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position.\\nDraw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\"\\nXI.\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET  \"Holmes.\"\\nsaid I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, \"here is a madman coming along.\\nIt seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.\"\\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder.\\nIt was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun.\\nDown the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell.\\nThe grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual.\\nIndeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure.\\nHe was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers.\\nYet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs.\\nAs he ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions.\\n\"What on earth can be the matter with him?\"\\nI asked.\\n\"He is looking up at the numbers of the houses.\"\\n\"I believe that he is coming here.\"\\nsaid Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\n\"Here?\"\\n\"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally.\\nI think that I recognise the symptoms.\\nHa!\\ndid I not tell you?\"\\nAs he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity.\\nFor a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason.\\nThen, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.\\nSherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\n\"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"You are fatigued with your haste.\\nPray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me.\"\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion.\\nThen he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.\\n\"No doubt you think me mad?\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"I see that you have had some great trouble.\"\\nresponded Holmes.\\n\"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible is it.\\nPublic disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.\\nPrivate affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul.\\nBesides, it is not I alone.\\nThe very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\"\\n\"Pray compose yourself, sir.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\"\\n\"My name.\"\\nanswered our visitor, \"is probably familiar to your ears.\\nI am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.\"\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.\\nWhat could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass?\\nWe waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\\n\"I feel that time is of value.\"\\nsaid he; \"that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation.\\nI came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow.\\nThat is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise.\\nI feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\n\"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors.\\nOne of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable.\\nWe have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\\n\"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks.\\nI started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England.\\nI was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\\n\"\\'Mr.\\nHolder,\\' said he, \\'I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.\\'\\n\"\\'The firm does so when the security is good.\\' I answered.\\n\"\\'It is absolutely essential to me,\\' said he, \\'that I should have 50,000 pounds at once.\\nI could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself.\\nIn my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one\\'s self under obligations.\\'\\n\"\\'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\\' I asked.\\n\"\\'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge.\\nBut it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once.\\'\\n\"\\'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,\\' said I, \\'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear.\\nIf, on the other hand, I am to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\\'\\n\"\\'I should much prefer to have it so,\\' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.\\n\\'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?\\'\\n\"\\'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,\\' said I.\\n\"\\'Precisely.\\' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named.\\n\\'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\\' said he, \\'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable.\\nThe lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked.\\nI am prepared to leave it with you as my security.\\'\\n\"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.\\n\"\\'You doubt its value?\\' he asked.\\n\"\\'Not at all.\\nI only doubt--\\'\\n\"\\'The propriety of my leaving it.\\nYou may set your mind at rest about that.\\nI should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it.\\nIt is a pure matter of form.\\nIs the security sufficient?\\'\\n\"\\'Ample.\\'\\n\"\\'You understand, Mr.\\nHolder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you.\\nI rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it.\\nAny injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.\\nI leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\\'\\n\"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000 pound notes.\\nWhen I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me.\\nThere could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it.\\nI already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it.\\nHowever, it was too late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.\\n\"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me.\\nBankers\\' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be?\\nIf so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself!\\nI determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach.\\nWith this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me.\\nI did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.\\n\"And now a word as to my household, Mr.\\nHolmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation.\\nMy groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether.\\nI have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion.\\nAnother, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months.\\nShe came with an excellent character, however, and has always given me satisfaction.\\nShe is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.\\nThat is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\\n\"So much for the servants.\\nMy family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it.\\nI am a widower and have an only son, Arthur.\\nHe has been a disappointment to me, Mr.\\nHolmes--a grievous disappointment.\\nI have no doubt that I am myself to blame.\\nPeople tell me that I have spoiled him.\\nVery likely I have.\\nWhen my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love.\\nI could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face.\\nI have never denied him a wish.\\nPerhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for the best.\\n\"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business turn.\\nHe was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money.\\nWhen he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits.\\nHe learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour.\\nHe tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.\\n\"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner.\\nHe is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty.\\nYet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted.\\nSo I think, and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\\'s quick insight into character.\\n\"And now there is only she to be described.\\nShe is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter.\\nShe is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.\\nShe is my right hand.\\nI do not know what I could do without her.\\nIn only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes.\\nTwice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him.\\nI think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas!\\nit is too late--forever too late!\\n\"Now, Mr.\\nHolmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable story.\\n\"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client.\\nLucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.\\nMary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.\\n\"\\'Where have you put it?\\' asked Arthur.\\n\"\\'In my own bureau.\\'\\n\"\\'Well, I hope to goodness the house won\\'t be burgled during the night.\\' said he.\\n\"\\'It is locked up,\\' I answered.\\n\"\\'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau.\\nWhen I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\\'\\n\"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said.\\nHe followed me to my room, however, that night with a very grave face.\\n\"\\'Look here, dad,\\' said he with his eyes cast down, \\'can you let me have 200 pounds?\\'\\n\"\\'No, I cannot!\\' I answered sharply.\\n\\'I have been far too generous with you in money matters.\\'\\n\"\\'You have been very kind,\\' said he, \\'but I must have this money, or else I can never show my face inside the club again.\\'\\n\"\\'And a very good thing, too!\\' I cried.\\n\"\\'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\\' said he.\\n\\'I could not bear the disgrace.\\nI must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\\'\\n\"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month.\\n\\'You shall not have a farthing from me,\\' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.\\n\"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again.\\nThen I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night.\\nAs I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.\\n\"\\'Tell me, dad,\\' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \\'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\\'\\n\"\\'Certainly not.\\'\\n\"\\'She came in just now by the back door.\\nI have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.\\'\\n\"\\'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it.\\nAre you sure that everything is fastened?\\'\\n\"\\'Quite sure, dad.\\'\\n\"\\'Then, good-night.\\' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.\\n\"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr.\\nHolmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.\"\\n\"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\"\\n\"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so.\\nI am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.\\nAbout two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house.\\nIt had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere.\\nI lay listening with all my ears.\\nSuddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room.\\nI slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.\\n\"\\'Arthur!\\' I screamed, \\'you villain!\\nyou thief!\\nHow dare you touch that coronet?\\'\\n\"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands.\\nHe appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength.\\nAt my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death.\\nI snatched it up and examined it.\\nOne of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\\n\"\\'You blackguard!\\' I shouted, beside myself with rage.\\n\\'You have destroyed it!\\nYou have dishonoured me forever!\\nWhere are the jewels which you have stolen?\\'\\n\"\\'Stolen!\\' he cried.\\n\"\\'Yes, thief!\\' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\n\"\\'There are none missing.\\nThere cannot be any missing,\\' said he.\\n\"\\'There are three missing.\\nAnd you know where they are.\\nMust I call you a liar as well as a thief?\\nDid I not see you trying to tear off another piece?\\'\\n\"\\'You have called me names enough,\\' said he, \\'I will not stand it any longer.\\nI shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me.\\nI will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world.\\'\\n\"\\'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\\' I cried half-mad with grief and rage.\\n\\'I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\\'\\n\"\\'You shall learn nothing from me,\\' said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature.\\n\\'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.\\'\\n\"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger.\\nMary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur\\'s face, she read the whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground.\\nI sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once.\\nWhen the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft.\\nI answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property.\\nI was determined that the law should have its way in everything.\\n\"\\'At least,\\' said he, \\'you will not have me arrested at once.\\nIt would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.\\'\\n\"\\'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,\\' said I.\\nAnd then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation.\\nHe might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones.\\n\"\\'You may as well face the matter,\\' said I; \\'you have been caught in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.\\nIf you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\\'\\n\"\\'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\\' he answered, turning away from me with a sneer.\\nI saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him.\\nThere was but one way for it.\\nI called in the inspector and gave him into custody.\\nA search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.\\nThis morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.\\nThe police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it.\\nYou may go to any expense which you think necessary.\\nI have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds.\\nMy God, what shall I do!\\nI have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night.\\nOh, what shall I do.\"\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\n\"Do you receive much company?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur\\'s.\\nSir George Burnwell has been several times lately.\\nNo one else, I think.\"\\n\"Do you go out much in society?\"\\n\"Arthur does.\\nMary and I stay at home.\\nWe neither of us care for it.\"\\n\"That is unusual in a young girl.\"\\n\"She is of a quiet nature.\\nBesides, she is not so very young.\\nShe is four-and-twenty.\"\\n\"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.\"\\n\"Terrible!\\nShe is even more affected than I.\"\\n\"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son\\'s guilt?\"\\n\"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.\"\\n\"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof.\\nWas the remainder of the coronet at all injured?\"\\n\"Yes, it was twisted.\"\\n\"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?\"\\n\"God bless you!\\nYou are doing what you can for him and for me.\\nBut it is too heavy a task.\\nWhat was he doing there at all?\\nIf his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?\"\\n\"Precisely.\\nAnd if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?\\nHis silence appears to me to cut both ways.\\nThere are several singular points about the case.\\nWhat did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?\"\\n\"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur\\'s closing his bedroom door.\"\\n\"A likely story!\\nAs if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household.\\nWhat did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?\"\\n\"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.\"\\n\"Have they thought of looking outside the house?\"\\n\"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy.\\nThe whole garden has already been minutely examined.\"\\n\"Now, my dear sir.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think?\\nIt appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex.\\nConsider what is involved by your theory.\\nYou suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered.\\nI ask you now, is such a theory tenable?\"\\n\"But what other is there?\"\\ncried the banker with a gesture of despair.\\n\"If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\"\\n\"It is our task to find that out.\"\\nreplied Holmes; \"so now, if you please, Mr.\\nHolder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\"\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened.\\nI confess that the guilt of the banker\\'s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\\' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.\\nHe hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\\nOur client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs.\\nA short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road.\\nA double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance.\\nOn the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\\'s entrance.\\nOn the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare.\\nHolmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen\\'s path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane.\\nSo long was he that Mr.\\nHolder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.\\nWe were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\\nShe was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin.\\nI do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\\'s face.\\nHer lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\\nAs she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for self-restraint.\\nDisregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\\n\"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?\"\\nshe asked.\\n\"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\"\\n\"But I am so sure that he is innocent.\\nYou know what woman\\'s instincts are.\\nI know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.\"\\n\"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\"\\n\"Who knows?\\nPerhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.\"\\n\"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?\"\\n\"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it.\\nOh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent.\\nLet the matter drop and say no more.\\nIt is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison.\"\\n\"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!\\nYour affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me.\\nFar from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it.\"\\n\"This gentleman?\"\\nshe asked, facing round to me.\\n\"No, his friend.\\nHe wished us to leave him alone.\\nHe is round in the stable lane now.\"\\n\"The stable lane?\"\\nShe raised her dark eyebrows.\\n\"What can he hope to find there?\\nAh!\\nthis, I suppose, is he.\\nI trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.\"\\n\"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it.\"\\nreturned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes.\\n\"I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\\nMight I ask you a question or two?\"\\n\"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\"\\n\"You heard nothing yourself last night?\"\\n\"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly.\\nI heard that, and I came down.\"\\n\"You shut up the windows and doors the night before.\\nDid you fasten all the windows?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Were they all fastened this morning?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"You have a maid who has a sweetheart?\\nI think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\"\\n\"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle\\'s remarks about the coronet.\"\\n\"I see.\\nYou infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.\"\\n\"But what is the good of all these vague theories.\"\\ncried the banker impatiently, \"when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?\"\\n\"Wait a little, Mr.\\nHolder.\\nWe must come back to that.\\nAbout this girl, Miss Holder.\\nYou saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\"\\n\"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in.\\nI saw the man, too, in the gloom.\"\\n\"Do you know him?\"\\n\"Oh, yes!\\nhe is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.\\nHis name is Francis Prosper.\"\\n\"He stood.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\"\\n\"Yes, he did.\"\\n\"And he is a man with a wooden leg?\"\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\\'s expressive black eyes.\\n\"Why, you are like a magician.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"How do you know that?\"\\nShe smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\\' thin, eager face.\\n\"I should be very glad now to go upstairs.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again.\\nPerhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.\"\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.\\nThis he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens.\\n\"Now we shall go upstairs.\"\\nsaid he at last.\\nThe banker\\'s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.\\nHolmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.\\n\"Which key was used to open it?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room.\"\\n\"Have you it here?\"\\n\"That is it on the dressing-table.\"\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\n\"It is a noiseless lock.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"It is no wonder that it did not wake you.\\nThis case, I presume, contains the coronet.\\nWe must have a look at it.\"\\nHe opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table.\\nIt was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\\'s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen.\\nAt one side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.\\n\"Now, Mr.\\nHolder.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost.\\nMight I beg that you will break it off.\"\\nThe banker recoiled in horror.\\n\"I should not dream of trying.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Then I will.\"\\nHolmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result.\\n\"I feel it give a little.\"\\nsaid he; \"but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to break it.\\nAn ordinary man could not do it.\\nNow, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr.\\nHolder?\\nThere would be a noise like a pistol shot.\\nDo you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\"\\n\"I do not know what to think.\\nIt is all dark to me.\"\\n\"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go.\\nWhat do you think, Miss Holder?\"\\n\"I confess that I still share my uncle\\'s perplexity.\"\\n\"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\"\\n\"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\"\\n\"Thank you.\\nWe have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up.\\nWith your permission, Mr.\\nHolder, I shall now continue my investigations outside.\"\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult.\\nFor an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.\\n\"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.\\nHolder.\"\\nsaid he; \"I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\"\\n\"But the gems, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nWhere are they?\"\\n\"I cannot tell.\"\\nThe banker wrung his hands.\\n\"I shall never see them again.\"\\nhe cried.\\n\"And my son?\\nYou give me hopes?\"\\n\"My opinion is in no way altered.\"\\n\"Then, for God\\'s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?\"\\n\"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer.\\nI understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.\"\\n\"I would give my fortune to have them back.\"\\n\"Very good.\\nI shall look into the matter between this and then.\\nGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again before evening.\"\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\\'s mind was now made up about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine.\\nSeveral times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair.\\nIt was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more.\\nHe hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.\\nWith his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\n\"I think that this should do.\"\\nsaid he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace.\\n\"I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won\\'t do.\\nI may be on the trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o\\'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is.\\nI hope that I may be back in a few hours.\"\\nHe cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand.\\nHe chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\n\"I only looked in as I passed.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"I am going right on.\"\\n\"Where to?\"\\n\"Oh, to the other side of the West End.\\nIt may be some time before I get back.\\nDon\\'t wait up for me in case I should be late.\"\\n\"How are you getting on?\"\\n\"Oh, so so.\\nNothing to complain of.\\nI have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house.\\nIt is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\\nHowever, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\"\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply.\\nHis eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks.\\nHe hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room.\\nIt was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise.\\nI do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.\\n\"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson.\"\\nsaid he, \"but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\"\\n\"Why, it is after nine now.\"\\nI answered.\\n\"I should not be surprised if that were he.\\nI thought I heard a ring.\"\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier.\\nI was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter.\\nHe entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.\\n\"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world.\\nNow I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age.\\nOne sorrow comes close upon the heels of another.\\nMy niece, Mary, has deserted me.\"\\n\"Deserted you?\"\\n\"Yes.\\nHer bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table.\\nI had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him.\\nPerhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so.\\nIt is to that remark that she refers in this note:  \"\\'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred.\\nI cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever.\\nDo not worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me.\\nIn life or in death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.\\'\\n\"What could she mean by that note, Mr.\\nHolmes?\\nDo you think it points to suicide?\"\\n\"No, no, nothing of the kind.\\nIt is perhaps the best possible solution.\\nI trust, Mr.\\nHolder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\"\\n\"Ha!\\nYou say so!\\nYou have heard something, Mr.\\nHolmes; you have learned something!\\nWhere are the gems?\"\\n\"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for them?\"\\n\"I would pay ten.\"\\n\"That would be unnecessary.\\nThree thousand will cover the matter.\\nAnd there is a little reward, I fancy.\\nHave you your check-book?\\nHere is a pen.\\nBetter make it out for 4000 pounds.\"\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check.\\nHolmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\n\"You have it.\"\\nhe gasped.\\n\"I am saved!\\nI am saved.\"\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\\n\"There is one other thing you owe, Mr.\\nHolder.\"\\nsaid Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.\\n\"Owe.\"\\nHe caught up a pen.\\n\"Name the sum, and I will pay it.\"\\n\"No, the debt is not to me.\\nYou owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\"\\n\"Then it was not Arthur who took them?\"\\n\"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\"\\n\"You are sure of it!\\nThen let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known.\"\\n\"He knows it already.\\nWhen I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me.\\nYour news of this morning, however, may open his lips.\"\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery.\"\\n\"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it.\\nAnd let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary.\\nThey have now fled together.\"\\n\"My Mary?\\nImpossible.\"\\n\"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain.\\nNeither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle.\\nHe is one of the most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience.\\nYour niece knew nothing of such men.\\nWhen he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart.\\nThe devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening.\"\\n\"I cannot, and I will not, believe it.\"\\ncried the banker with an ashen face.\\n\"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.\\nYour niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane.\\nHis footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there.\\nShe told him of the coronet.\\nHis wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will.\\nI have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.\\nShe had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants\\' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.\\n\"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.\\nIn the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room.\\nPetrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair.\\nPresently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands.\\nShe passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath.\\nHe saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\n\"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved.\\nBut the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right.\\nHe rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight.\\nSir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other.\\nIn the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye.\\nThen something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\"\\n\"Is it possible?\"\\ngasped the banker.\\n\"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks.\\nHe could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands.\\nHe took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret.\"\\n\"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet.\"\\ncried Mr.\\nHolder.\\n\"Oh, my God!\\nwhat a blind fool I have been!\\nAnd his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!\\nThe dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle.\\nHow cruelly I have misjudged him.\"\\n\"When I arrived at the house.\"\\ncontinued Holmes, \"I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me.\\nI knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions.\\nI passed along the tradesmen\\'s path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable.\\nJust beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.\\nI could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away.\\nI thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.\\nI passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\\n\"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet.\\nI was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son.\\nThe first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other.\\nI followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting.\\nThen I walked to the other end, which was a hundred yards or more down the lane.\\nI saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken.\\nBoots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt.\\nWhen he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.\\n\"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out.\\nI could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in.\\nI was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred.\\nA man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected.\\nHe had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent.\\nSo far I was clear.\\nThe question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?\\n\"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\\nNow, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids.\\nBut if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place?\\nThere could be no possible reason.\\nAs he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one.\\nWhen I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\\n\"And who could it be who was her confederate?\\nA lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you?\\nI knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited one.\\nBut among them was Sir George Burnwell.\\nI had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women.\\nIt must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.\\nEven though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.\\n\"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next.\\nI went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\\'s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes.\\nWith these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.\"\\n\"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nHolder.\\n\"Precisely.\\nIt was I.\\nI found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes.\\nIt was a delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter.\\nI went and saw him.\\nAt first, of course, he denied everything.\\nBut when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall.\\nI knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.\\nThen he became a little more reasonable.\\nI told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece.\\nThat brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown.\\n\\'Why, dash it all!\\' said he, \\'I\\'ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\\' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution.\\nOff I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece.\\nThen I looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\\'clock, after what I may call a really hard day\\'s work.\"\\n\"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal.\"\\nsaid the banker, rising.\\n\"Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done.\\nYour skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it.\\nAnd now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him.\\nAs to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart.\\nNot even your skill can inform me where she is now.\"\\n\"I think that we may safely say.\"\\nreturned Holmes, \"that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is.\\nIt is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.\"\\nXII.\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES  \"To the man who loves art for its own sake.\"\\nremarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, \"it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived.\\nIt is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special province.\"\\n\"And yet.\"\\nsaid I, smiling, \"I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\"\\n\"You have erred, perhaps.\"\\nhe observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--\"you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.\"\\n\"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter.\"\\nI remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\\'s singular character.\\n\"No, it is not selfishness or conceit.\"\\nsaid he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words.\\n\"If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself.\\nCrime is common.\\nLogic is rare.\\nTherefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell.\\nYou have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\"\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street.\\nA thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths.\\nOur gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.\\nSherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\n\"At the same time.\"\\nhe remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all.\\nThe small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law.\\nBut in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\"\\n\"The end may have been so.\"\\nI answered, \"but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest.\"\\n\"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!\\nBut, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past.\\nMan, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality.\\nAs to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools.\\nI think that I have touched bottom at last, however.\\nThis note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy.\\nRead it.\"\\nHe tossed a crumpled letter across to me.\\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:  \"DEAR MR.\\nHOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess.\\nI shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you.\\nYours faithfully,                                                \"VIOLET HUNTER.\"\\n\"Do you know the young lady?\"\\nI asked.\\n\"Not I.\"\\n\"It is half-past ten now.\"\\n\"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\"\\n\"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think.\\nYou remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.\\nIt may be so in this case, also.\"\\n\"Well, let us hope so.\\nBut our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\"\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.\\nShe was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover\\'s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.\\n\"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure.\"\\nsaid she, as my companion rose to greet her, \"but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.\"\\n\"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter.\\nI shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.\"\\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client.\\nHe looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.\\n\"I have been a governess for five years.\"\\nsaid she, \"in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation.\\nI advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success.\\nAt last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit\\'s end as to what I should do.\\n\"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway\\'s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.\\nWestaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper.\\nShe sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.\\n\"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone.\\nA prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.\\nAs I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.\\n\"\\'That will do,\\' said he; \\'I could not ask for anything better.\\nCapital!\\ncapital!\\' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion.\\nHe was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.\\n\"\\'You are looking for a situation, miss?\\' he asked.\\n\"\\'Yes, sir.\\'\\n\"\\'As governess?\\'\\n\"\\'Yes, sir.\\'\\n\"\\'And what salary do you ask?\\'\\n\"\\'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\\'\\n\"\\'Oh, tut, tut!\\nsweating--rank sweating!\\' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion.\\n\\'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?\\'\\n\"\\'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\\' said I.\\n\\'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--\\'\\n\"\\'Tut, tut!\\' he cried.\\n\\'This is all quite beside the question.\\nThe point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady?\\nThere it is in a nutshell.\\nIf you have not, you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country.\\nBut if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures?\\nYour salary with me, madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.\\'\\n\"You may imagine, Mr.\\nHolmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true.\\nThe gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took out a note.\\n\"\\'It is also my custom,\\' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, \\'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.\\'\\n\"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man.\\nAs I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.\\n\"\\'May I ask where you live, sir?\\' said I.\\n\"\\'Hampshire.\\nCharming rural place.\\nThe Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of Winchester.\\nIt is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.\\'\\n\"\\'And my duties, sir?\\nI should be glad to know what they would be.\\'\\n\"\\'One child--one dear little romper just six years old.\\nOh, if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper!\\nSmack!\\nsmack!\\nsmack!\\nThree gone before you could wink!\\' He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.\\n\"I was a little startled at the nature of the child\\'s amusement, but the father\\'s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\n\"\\'My sole duties, then,\\' I asked, \\'are to take charge of a single child?\\'\\n\"\\'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\\' he cried.\\n\\'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey.\\nYou see no difficulty, heh?\\'\\n\"\\'I should be happy to make myself useful.\\'\\n\"\\'Quite so.\\nIn dress now, for example.\\nWe are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted.\\nIf you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.\\nHeh?\\'\\n\"\\'No,\\' said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\n\"\\'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\\'\\n\"\\'Oh, no.\\'\\n\"\\'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\\'\\n\"I could hardly believe my ears.\\nAs you may observe, Mr.\\nHolmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.\\nIt has been considered artistic.\\nI could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.\\n\"\\'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\\' said I.\\nHe had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.\\n\"\\'I am afraid that it is quite essential,\\' said he.\\n\\'It is a little fancy of my wife\\'s, and ladies\\' fancies, you know, madam, ladies\\' fancies must be consulted.\\nAnd so you won\\'t cut your hair?\\'\\n\"\\'No, sir, I really could not,\\' I answered firmly.\\n\"\\'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter.\\nIt is a pity, because in other respects you would really have done very nicely.\\nIn that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies.\\'\\n\"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.\\n\"\\'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\\' she asked.\\n\"\\'If you please, Miss Stoper.\\'\\n\"\\'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,\\' said she sharply.\\n\\'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.\\nGood-day to you, Miss Hunter.\\' She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.\\n\"Well, Mr.\\nHolmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing.\\nAfter all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity.\\nVery few governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year.\\nBesides, what use was my hair to me?\\nMany people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number.\\nNext day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it.\\nI had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself.\\nI have it here and I will read it to you:                         \"\\'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\n\"\\'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision.\\nMy wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you.\\nWe are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you.\\nThey are not very exacting, after all.\\nMy wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning.\\nYou need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well.\\nThen, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience.\\nAs regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss.\\nYour duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light.\\nNow do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester.\\nLet me know your train.\\nYours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\\'\\n\"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr.\\nHolmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it.\\nI thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration.\"\\n\"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question.\"\\nsaid Holmes, smiling.\\n\"But you would not advise me to refuse?\"\\n\"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for.\"\\n\"What is the meaning of it all, Mr.\\nHolmes?\"\\n\"Ah, I have no data.\\nI cannot tell.\\nPerhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?\"\\n\"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution.\\nMr.\\nRucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man.\\nIs it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?\"\\n\"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one.\\nBut in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.\"\\n\"But the money, Mr.\\nHolmes, the money.\"\\n\"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good.\\nThat is what makes me uneasy.\\nWhy should they give you 120 pounds a year, when they could have their pick for 40 pounds?\\nThere must be some strong reason behind.\"\\n\"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help.\\nI should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.\"\\n\"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you.\\nI assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months.\\nThere is something distinctly novel about some of the features.\\nIf you should find yourself in doubt or in danger-.\"\\n\"Danger!\\nWhat danger do you foresee?\"\\nHolmes shook his head gravely.\\n\"It would cease to be a danger if we could define it.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.\"\\n\"That is enough.\"\\nShe rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face.\\n\"I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now.\\nI shall write to Mr.\\nRucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\"\\nWith a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.\\n\"At least.\"\\nsaid I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, \"she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.\"\\n\"And she would need to be.\"\\nsaid Holmes gravely.\\n\"I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past.\"\\nIt was not very long before my friend\\'s prediction was fulfilled.\\nA fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into.\\nThe unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine.\\nAs to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.\\n\"Data!\\ndata!\\ndata.\"\\nhe cried impatiently.\\n\"I can\\'t make bricks without clay.\"\\nAnd yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning.\\nHe opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.\\n\"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw.\"\\nsaid he, and turned back to his chemical studies.\\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\\n\"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow.\"\\nit said.\\n\"Do come!\\nI am at my wit\\'s end.\\nHUNTER.\"\\n\"Will you come with me?\"\\nasked Holmes, glancing up.\\n\"I should wish to.\"\\n\"Just look it up, then.\"\\n\"There is a train at half-past nine.\"\\nsaid I, glancing over my Bradshaw.\\n\"It is due at Winchester at 11:30.\"\\n\"That will do very nicely.\\nThen perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the morning.\"\\nBy eleven o\\'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital.\\nHolmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery.\\nIt was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east.\\nThe sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\\'s energy.\\nAll over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage.\\n\"Are they not fresh and beautiful?\"\\nI cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\n\"Do you know, Watson.\"\\nsaid he, \"that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject.\\nYou look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty.\\nI look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.\"\\n\"Good heavens.\"\\nI cried.\\n\"Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?\"\\n\"They always fill me with a certain horror.\\nIt is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.\"\\n\"You horrify me.\"\\n\"But the reason is very obvious.\\nThe pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish.\\nThere is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\\'s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock.\\nBut look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law.\\nThink of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.\\nHad this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should never have had a fear for her.\\nIt is the five miles of country which makes the danger.\\nStill, it is clear that she is not personally threatened.\"\\n\"No.\\nIf she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\"\\n\"Quite so.\\nShe has her freedom.\"\\n\"What CAN be the matter, then?\\nCan you suggest no explanation?\"\\n\"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them.\\nBut which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us.\\nWell, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\"\\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us.\\nShe had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.\\n\"I am so delighted that you have come.\"\\nshe said earnestly.\\n\"It is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do.\\nYour advice will be altogether invaluable to me.\"\\n\"Pray tell us what has happened to you.\"\\n\"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.\\nRucastle to be back before three.\\nI got his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.\"\\n\"Let us have everything in its due order.\"\\nHolmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\n\"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nRucastle.\\nIt is only fair to them to say that.\\nBut I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind about them.\"\\n\"What can you not understand?\"\\n\"Their reasons for their conduct.\\nBut you shall have it all just as it occurred.\\nWhen I came down, Mr.\\nRucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches.\\nIt is, as he said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather.\\nThere are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door.\\nThis ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton\\'s preserves.\\nA clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\\n\"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.\\nThere was no truth, Mr.\\nHolmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street.\\nMrs.\\nRucastle is not mad.\\nI found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five.\\nFrom their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.\\nMr.\\nRucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother.\\nAs the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father\\'s young wife.\\n\"Mrs.\\nRucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature.\\nShe impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.\\nShe was a nonentity.\\nIt was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son.\\nHer light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible.\\nHe was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\\nAnd yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman.\\nShe would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.\\nMore than once I have surprised her in tears.\\nI have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature.\\nHe is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.\\nHis whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking.\\nGiving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects.\\nBut I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr.\\nHolmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\"\\n\"I am glad of all details.\"\\nremarked my friend, \"whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.\"\\n\"I shall try not to miss anything of importance.\\nThe one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants.\\nThere are only two, a man and his wife.\\nToller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink.\\nTwice since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr.\\nRucastle seemed to take no notice of it.\\nHis wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs.\\nRucastle and much less amiable.\\nThey are a most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of the building.\\n\"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs.\\nRucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.\\n\"\\'Oh, yes,\\' said he, turning to me, \\'we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.\\nI assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance.\\nWe shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you.\\nYou will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\\'\\n\"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue.\\nIt was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before.\\nIt could not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it.\\nBoth Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nRucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence.\\nThey were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor.\\nA chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.\\nIn this I was asked to sit, and then Mr.\\nRucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to.\\nYou cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary.\\nMrs.\\nRucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face.\\nAfter an hour or so, Mr.\\nRucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.\\n\"Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances.\\nAgain I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire, and which he told inimitably.\\nThen he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him.\\nI read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\\n\"You can easily imagine, Mr.\\nHolmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be.\\nThey were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back.\\nAt first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means.\\nMy hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief.\\nOn the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me.\\nI confess that I was disappointed.\\nThere was nothing.\\nAt least that was my first impression.\\nAt the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction.\\nThe road is an important highway, and there are usually people there.\\nThis man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up.\\nI lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs.\\nRucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze.\\nShe said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me.\\nShe rose at once.\\n\"\\'Jephro,\\' said she, \\'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.\\'\\n\"\\'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\\' he asked.\\n\"\\'No, I know no one in these parts.\\'\\n\"\\'Dear me!\\nHow very impertinent!\\nKindly turn round and motion to him to go away.\\'\\n\"\\'Surely it would be better to take no notice.\\'\\n\"\\'No, no, we should have him loitering here always.\\nKindly turn round and wave him away like that.\\'\\n\"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs.\\nRucastle drew down the blind.\\nThat was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road.\"\\n\"Pray continue.\"\\nsaid Holmes.\\n\"Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one.\"\\n\"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.\\nOn the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr.\\nRucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door.\\nAs we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving about.\\n\"\\'Look in here!\\' said Mr.\\nRucastle, showing me a slit between two planks.\\n\\'Is he not a beauty?\\'\\n\"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness.\\n\"\\'Don\\'t be frightened,\\' said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given.\\n\\'It\\'s only Carlo, my mastiff.\\nI call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him.\\nWe feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as mustard.\\nToller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon.\\nFor goodness\\' sake don\\'t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\\'s as much as your life is worth.\\'\\n\"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o\\'clock in the morning.\\nIt was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day.\\nI was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches.\\nAs it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was.\\nIt was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones.\\nIt walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.\\nThat dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\n\"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you.\\nI had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk.\\nOne evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.\\nThere was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked.\\nI had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.\\nIt struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it.\\nThe very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open.\\nThere was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was.\\nIt was my coil of hair.\\n\"I took it up and examined it.\\nIt was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness.\\nBut then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me.\\nHow could my hair have been locked in the drawer?\\nWith trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.\\nI laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical.\\nWas it not extraordinary?\\nPuzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant.\\nI returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.\\n\"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr.\\nHolmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.\\nThere was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all.\\nA door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.\\nOne day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr.\\nRucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed.\\nHis cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion.\\nHe locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.\\n\"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house.\\nThere were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up.\\nThey were evidently all deserted.\\nAs I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr.\\nRucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\\n\"\\'Ah!\\' said he, \\'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady.\\nI was preoccupied with business matters.\\'\\n\"I assured him that I was not offended.\\n\\'By the way,\\' said I, \\'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.\\'\\n\"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.\\n\"\\'Photography is one of my hobbies,\\' said he.\\n\\'I have made my dark room up there.\\nBut, dear me!\\nwhat an observant young lady we have come upon.\\nWho would have believed it?\\nWho would have ever believed it?\\' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me.\\nI read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\n\"Well, Mr.\\nHolmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them.\\nIt was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that.\\nIt was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place.\\nThey talk of woman\\'s instinct; perhaps it was woman\\'s instinct which gave me that feeling.\\nAt any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\\n\"It was only yesterday that the chance came.\\nI may tell you that, besides Mr.\\nRucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door.\\nRecently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door.\\nI have no doubt at all that he had left it there.\\nMr.\\nand Mrs.\\nRucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity.\\nI turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\\n\"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.\\nRound this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\\nThey each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them.\\nThe centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord.\\nThe door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there.\\nThis barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness.\\nEvidently there was a skylight which let in light from above.\\nAs I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door.\\nA mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nMy overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress.\\nI rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr.\\nRucastle, who was waiting outside.\\n\"\\'So,\\' said he, smiling, \\'it was you, then.\\nI thought that it must be when I saw the door open.\\'\\n\"\\'Oh, I am so frightened!\\' I panted.\\n\"\\'My dear young lady!\\nmy dear young lady!\\'--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was--\\'and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?\\'\\n\"But his voice was just a little too coaxing.\\nHe overdid it.\\nI was keenly on my guard against him.\\n\"\\'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\\' I answered.\\n\\'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again.\\nOh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\\'\\n\"\\'Only that?\\' said he, looking at me keenly.\\n\"\\'Why, what did you think?\\' I asked.\\n\"\\'Why do you think that I lock this door?\\'\\n\"\\'I am sure that I do not know.\\'\\n\"\\'It is to keep people out who have no business there.\\nDo you see?\\' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.\\n\"\\'I am sure if I had known--\\'\\n\"\\'Well, then, you know now.\\nAnd if you ever put your foot over that threshold again\\'--here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon--\\'I\\'ll throw you to the mastiff.\\'\\n\"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did.\\nI suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room.\\nI remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over.\\nThen I thought of you, Mr.\\nHolmes.\\nI could not live there longer without some advice.\\nI was frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child.\\nThey were all horrible to me.\\nIf I could only bring you down all would be well.\\nOf course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears.\\nMy mind was soon made up.\\nI would send you a wire.\\nI put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier.\\nA horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him free.\\nI slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.\\nI had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\\'clock, for Mr.\\nand Mrs.\\nRucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the evening, so that I must look after the child.\\nNow I have told you all my adventures, Mr.\\nHolmes, and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\"\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.\\nMy friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\n\"Is Toller still drunk?\"\\nhe asked.\\n\"Yes.\\nI heard his wife tell Mrs.\\nRucastle that she could do nothing with him.\"\\n\"That is well.\\nAnd the Rucastles go out to-night?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?\"\\n\"Yes, the wine-cellar.\"\\n\"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter.\\nDo you think that you could perform one more feat?\\nI should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman.\"\\n\"I will try.\\nWhat is it?\"\\n\"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\\'clock, my friend and I.\\nThe Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable.\\nThere only remains Mrs.\\nToller, who might give the alarm.\\nIf you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\"\\n\"I will do it.\"\\n\"Excellent!\\nWe shall then look thoroughly into the affair.\\nOf course there is only one feasible explanation.\\nYou have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.\\nThat is obvious.\\nAs to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America.\\nYou were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair.\\nHers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also.\\nBy a curious chance you came upon her tresses.\\nThe man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiancé--and no doubt, as you wore the girl\\'s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.\\nThe dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her.\\nSo much is fairly clear.\\nThe most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.\"\\n\"What on earth has that to do with it?\"\\nI ejaculated.\\n\"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents.\\nDon\\'t you see that the converse is equally valid.\\nI have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.\\nThis child\\'s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\\'s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.\"\\n\"I am sure that you are right, Mr.\\nHolmes.\"\\ncried our client.\\n\"A thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it.\\nOh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature.\"\\n\"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man.\\nWe can do nothing until seven o\\'clock.\\nAt that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\"\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house.\\nThe group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\\n\"Have you managed it?\"\\nasked Holmes.\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs.\\n\"That is Mrs.\\nToller in the cellar.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug.\\nHere are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\\nRucastle\\'s.\"\\n\"You have done well indeed.\"\\ncried Holmes with enthusiasm.\\n\"Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\"\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described.\\nHolmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar.\\nThen he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success.\\nNo sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes\\' face clouded over.\\n\"I trust that we are not too late.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in without you.\\nNow, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\"\\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\\nTogether we rushed into the room.\\nIt was empty.\\nThere was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen.\\nThe skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\\n\"There has been some villainy here.\"\\nsaid Holmes; \"this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter\\'s intentions and has carried his victim off.\"\\n\"But how?\"\\n\"Through the skylight.\\nWe shall soon see how he managed it.\"\\nHe swung himself up onto the roof.\\n\"Ah, yes.\"\\nhe cried, \"here\\'s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves.\\nThat is how he did it.\"\\n\"But it is impossible.\"\\nsaid Miss Hunter; \"the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away.\"\\n\"He has come back and done it.\\nI tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man.\\nI should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair.\\nI think, Watson, that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready.\"\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand.\\nMiss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\\n\"You villain.\"\\nsaid he, \"where\\'s your daughter?\"\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\\n\"It is for me to ask you that.\"\\nhe shrieked, \"you thieves!\\nSpies and thieves!\\nI have caught you, have I?\\nYou are in my power.\\nI\\'ll serve you.\"\\nHe turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\\n\"He\\'s gone for the dog.\"\\ncried Miss Hunter.\\n\"I have my revolver.\"\\nsaid I.\\n\"Better close the front door.\"\\ncried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together.\\nWe had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to.\\nAn elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\\n\"My God.\"\\nhe cried.\\n\"Someone has loosed the dog.\\nIt\\'s not been fed for two days.\\nQuick, quick, or it\\'ll be too late.\"\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us.\\nThere was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle\\'s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground.\\nRunning up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck.\\nWith much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house.\\nWe laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain.\\nWe were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\\n\"Mrs.\\nToller.\"\\ncried Miss Hunter.\\n\"Yes, miss.\\nMr.\\nRucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you.\\nAh, miss, it is a pity you didn\\'t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\"\\n\"Ha.\"\\nsaid Holmes, looking keenly at her.\\n\"It is clear that Mrs.\\nToller knows more about this matter than anyone else.\"\\n\"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\"\\n\"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\"\\n\"I will soon make it clear to you.\"\\nsaid she; \"and I\\'d have done so before now if I could ha\\' got out from the cellar.\\nIf there\\'s police-court business over this, you\\'ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\\'s friend too.\\n\"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\\'t, from the time that her father married again.\\nShe was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr.\\nFowler at a friend\\'s house.\\nAs well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr.\\nRucastle\\'s hands.\\nHe knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it.\\nHe wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money.\\nWhen she wouldn\\'t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\\'s door.\\nThen she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn\\'t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.\"\\n\"Ah.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains.\\nMr.\\nRucastle then, I presume, took to this system of imprisonment?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr.\\nFowler.\"\\n\"That was it, sir.\"\\n\"But Mr.\\nFowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as his.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nFowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nToller serenely.\\n\"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out.\"\\n\"You have it, sir, just as it happened.\"\\n\"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs.\\nToller.\"\\nsaid Holmes, \"for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us.\\nAnd here comes the country surgeon and Mrs.\\nRucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one.\"\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door.\\nMr.\\nRucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.\\nThey still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle\\'s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them.\\nMr.\\nFowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius.\\nAs to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\\n\\nCopyright (C) 2002 David Wyllie.\\nMetamorphosis   Franz Kafka  Translated by David Wyllie    I   One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.\\nHe lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.\\nHis many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\\n\"What\\'s happened to me?\"\\nhe thought.\\nIt wasn\\'t a dream.\\nHis room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.\\nA collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.\\nIt showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.\\nDrops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\\n\"How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense\", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn\\'t get into that position.\\nHowever hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.\\nHe must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn\\'t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.\\n\"Oh, God\", he thought, \"what a strenuous career it is that I\\'ve chosen!\\nTravelling day in and day out.\\nDoing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there\\'s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them.\\nIt can all go to Hell.\"\\nHe felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn\\'t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.\\nHe slid back into his former position.\\n\"Getting up early all the time\", he thought, \"it makes you stupid.\\nYou\\'ve got to get enough sleep.\\nOther travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.\\nFor instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I\\'d get kicked out on the spot.\\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me.\\nIf I didn\\'t have my parents to think about I\\'d have given in my notice a long time ago, I\\'d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel.\\nHe\\'d fall right off his desk!\\nAnd it\\'s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing.\\nWell, there\\'s still some hope; once I\\'ve got the money together to pay off my parents\\' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that\\'s definitely what I\\'ll do.\\nThat\\'s when I\\'ll make the big change.\\nFirst of all though, I\\'ve got to get up, my train leaves at five.\"\\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\\n\"God in Heaven.\"\\nhe thought.\\nIt was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven.\\nHad the alarm clock not rung?\\nHe could see from the bed that it had been set for four o\\'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung.\\nYes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?\\nTrue, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that.\\nWhat should he do now?\\nThe next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively.\\nAnd even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss\\'s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o\\'clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor\\'s not being there a long time ago.\\nThe office assistant was the boss\\'s man, spineless, and with no understanding.\\nWhat about if he reported sick?\\nBut that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.\\nHis boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor\\'s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.\\nAnd what\\'s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case?\\nGregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.\\nThere was a cautious knock at the door near his head.\\n\"Gregor\", somebody called - it was his mother - \"it\\'s quarter to seven.\\nDidn\\'t you want to go somewhere?\"\\nThat gentle voice!\\nGregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before.\\nAs if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not.\\nGregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: \"Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I\\'m getting up now.\"\\nThe change in Gregor\\'s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away.\\nBut this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.\\n\"Gregor, Gregor\", he called, \"what\\'s wrong?\"\\nAnd after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: \"Gregor!\\nGregor.\"\\nAt the other side door his sister came plaintively: \"Gregor?\\nAren\\'t you well?\\nDo you need anything?\"\\nGregor answered to both sides: \"I\\'m ready, now\", making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word.\\nHis father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: \"Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.\"\\nGregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.\\nOnly then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed.\\nHe remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today.\\nHe did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves.\\nBut it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.\\nHe would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control.\\nIf he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully.\\n\"This is something that can\\'t be done in bed\", Gregor said to himself, \"so don\\'t keep trying to do it\".\\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.\\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side.\\nThis he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.\\nBut when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way.\\nAnd he could not knock himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.\\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos.\\nHe told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice.\\nAt the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions.\\nAt times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him.\\n\"Seven o\\'clock, already\", he said to himself when the clock struck again, \"seven o\\'clock, and there\\'s still a fog like this.\"\\nAnd he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.\\nBut then he said to himself: \"Before it strikes quarter past seven I\\'ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.\\nAnd by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what\\'s happened to me as well, as they open up at work before seven o\\'clock.\"\\nAnd so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time.\\nIf he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.\\nHis back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.\\nHis main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm.\\nBut it was something that had to be risked.\\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him.\\nTwo strong people - he had his father and the maid in mind - would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.\\nShould he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?\\nDespite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.\\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.\\nThe time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon.\\nThen there was a ring at the door of the flat.\\n\"That\\'ll be someone from work\", he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.\\nFor a moment everything remained quiet.\\n\"They\\'re not opening the door\", Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope.\\nBut then of course, the maid\\'s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor\\'s first words of greeting and he knew who it was - the chief clerk himself.\\nWhy did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming?\\nWere all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn\\'t get out of bed if he didn\\'t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business?\\nWas it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were even necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it?\\nAnd more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.\\nThere was a loud thump, but it wasn\\'t really a loud noise.\\nHis fall was softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor\\'s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable.\\nHe had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.\\n\"Something\\'s fallen down in there\", said the chief clerk in the room on the left.\\nGregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible.\\nBut as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk\\'s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.\\nFrom the room on his right, Gregor\\'s sister whispered to him to let him know: \"Gregor, the chief clerk is here.\"\\n\"Yes, I know\", said Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\\n\"Gregor\", said his father now from the room to his left, \"the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn\\'t leave on the early train.\\nWe don\\'t know what to say to him.\\nAnd anyway, he wants to speak to you personally.\\nSo please open up this door.\\nI\\'m sure he\\'ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.\"\\nThen the chief clerk called \"Good morning,  Mr.\\nSamsa\".\\n\"He isn\\'t well\", said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door.\\n\"He isn\\'t well, please believe me.\\nWhy else would Gregor have missed a train!\\nThe lad only ever thinks about the business.\\nIt nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he\\'s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening.\\nHe sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables.\\nHis idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw.\\nHe\\'s made a little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you\\'ll be amazed how nice it is; it\\'s hanging up in his room; you\\'ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door.\\nAnyway, I\\'m glad you\\'re here; we wouldn\\'t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he\\'s so stubborn; and I\\'m sure he isn\\'t well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn\\'t.\"\\n\"I\\'ll be there in a moment\", said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation.\\n\"Well I can\\'t think of any other way of explaining it,  Mrs.\\nSamsa\", said the chief clerk, \"I hope it\\'s nothing serious.\\nBut on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.\"\\n\"Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?\", asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again.\\n\"No\", said Gregor.\\nIn the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.\\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others?\\nShe had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.\\nAnd why was she crying?\\nWas it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before?\\nThere was no need to worry about things like that yet.\\nGregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family.\\nFor the time being he just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.\\nIt was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.\\nAnd it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying.\\nBut the others didn\\'t know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour.\\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, \"Mr.\\nSamsa\", he called to him, \"what is wrong?\\nYou barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mention this just by the way - you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of.\\nI\\'m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation.\\nI am astonished, quite astonished.\\nI thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.\\nThis morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it\\'s true - it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation.\\nBut now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf.\\nAnd nor is your position all that secure.\\nI had originally intended to say all this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don\\'t see why your parents should not also learn of it.\\nYour turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it\\'s not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all,  Mr.\\nSamsa, we cannot allow there to be.\"\\n\"But Sir\", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, \"I\\'ll open up immediately, just a moment.\\nI\\'m slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven\\'t been able to get up.\\nI\\'m still in bed now.\\nI\\'m quite fresh again now, though.\\nI\\'m just getting out of bed.\\nJust a moment.\\nBe patient!\\nIt\\'s not quite as easy as I\\'d thought.\\nI\\'m quite alright now, though.\\nIt\\'s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person!\\nI was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already.\\nThey must have noticed it.\\nI don\\'t know why I didn\\'t let you know at work!\\nBut you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home.\\nPlease, don\\'t make my parents suffer!\\nThere\\'s no basis for any of the accusations you\\'re making; nobody\\'s ever said a word to me about any of these things.\\nMaybe you haven\\'t read the latest contracts I sent in.\\nI\\'ll set off with the eight o\\'clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me strength.\\nYou don\\'t need to wait, sir; I\\'ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him.\"\\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this was easily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed - where he now tried to get himself upright.\\nHe really did want to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him.\\nIf they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor\\'s responsibility and he could rest.\\nIf, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o\\'clock.\\nThe first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it.\\nNow he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs.\\nBy now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\\n\"Did you understand a word of all that?\"\\nthe chief clerk asked his parents, \"surely he\\'s not trying to make fools of us\".\\n\"Oh, God.\"\\ncalled his mother, who was already in tears, \"he could be seriously ill and we\\'re making him suffer.\\nGrete!\\nGrete.\"\\nshe then cried.\\n\"Mother?\"\\nhis sister called from the other side.\\nThey communicated across Gregor\\'s room.\\n\"You\\'ll have to go for the doctor straight away.\\nGregor is ill.\\nQuick, get the doctor.\\nDid you hear the way Gregor spoke just now?\"\\n\"That was the voice of an animal\", said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother\\'s screams.\\n\"Anna!\\nAnna.\"\\nhis father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, \"get a locksmith here, now.\"\\nAnd the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went.\\nHow had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly?\\nThere was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open;  people often do in homes where something awful has happened.\\nGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.\\nSo they couldn\\'t understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.\\nThey had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help.\\nThe first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better.\\nHe felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements - although he did not really distinguish one from the other.\\nWhatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself.\\nMeanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room.\\nPerhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening.\\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.\\nOnce there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs.\\nHe rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth.\\nHe seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key?\\n- but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.\\n\"Listen\", said the chief clerk in the next room, \"he\\'s turning the key.\"\\nGregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: \"Well done, Gregor\", they should have cried, \"keep at it, keep hold of the lock.\"\\nAnd with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself.\\nAs the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed.\\nThe clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor\\'s sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself: \"So, I didn\\'t need the locksmith after all\".\\nThen he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.\\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen.\\nHe had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room.\\nHe was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud \"Oh!\", which sounded like the soughing of the wind.\\nNow he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door - his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.\\nGregor\\'s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk\\'s being there, looked at his father.\\nThen she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast.\\nHis father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.\\nThen he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.\\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place.\\nIn this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.\\nMeanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a hospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its facade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time.\\nThe washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor\\'s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers.\\nOn the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing.\\nThe door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.\\n\"Now, then\", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm, \"I\\'ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and set off.\\nWill you please just let me leave?\\nYou can see\", he said to the chief clerk, \"that I\\'m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn\\'t earn my living.\\nSo where are you going, in to the office?\\nYes?\\nWill you report everything accurately, then?\\nIt\\'s quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that\\'s just the right time to remember what\\'s been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration.\\nYou\\'re well aware that I\\'m seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister, so that I\\'m trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work my way out of it again.\\nPlease don\\'t make things any harder for me than they are already, and don\\'t take sides against me at the office.\\nI know that nobody likes the travellers.\\nThey think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.\\nThat\\'s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it.\\nBut you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss himself - it\\'s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should.\\nAnd you\\'re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it\\'s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don\\'t usually even hear about them, or if at all it\\'s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that\\'s when we feel the harmful effects of what\\'s been going on without even knowing what caused them.\\nPlease, don\\'t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I\\'m at least partly right.\"\\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left.\\nHe did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him.\\nHe moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.\\nIt was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic.\\nIn the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger.\\nThat was something his parents did not understand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future.\\nGregor, though, did think about the future.\\nThe chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it!\\nIf only his sister were here!\\nShe was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.\\nAnd the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state.\\nBut his sister was not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself.\\nAnd without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, or that his speech still might not - or probably would not - be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.\\nHardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end.\\nHe held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor.\\nHis mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: \"Help, for pity\\'s sake, Help.\"\\nThe way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\\n\"Mother, mother\", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.\\nHe had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee.\\nThat set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her.\\nGregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the last time.\\nGregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase.\\nThe flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor\\'s father into a panic as well.\\nUntil then he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him, Gregor\\'s father seized the chief clerk\\'s stick in his right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went.\\nGregor\\'s appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\\nAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor\\'s mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face.\\nA strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.\\nNothing would stop Gregor\\'s father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man.\\nGregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly.\\nIf Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father\\'s hand any moment.\\nEventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn himself round.\\nIt went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn.\\nIf only his father would stop that unbearable hissing!\\nIt was making Gregor quite confused.\\nWhen he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come.\\nHe was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty.\\nIn his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through.\\nHe was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible.\\nNor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.\\nWhat he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen.\\nOne side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground.\\nThen his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into his room.\\nThe door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet.\\nII   It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep.\\nHe would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn\\'t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested.\\nBut he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him.\\nThe light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was dark.\\nHe pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value - in order to see what had been happening there.\\nThe whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar,  and he limped badly on his two rows of legs.\\nOne of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning - it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been - and dragged along lifelessly.\\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat.\\nBy the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.\\nHe was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly covering his eyes with it.\\nBut he soon drew his head back again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food - he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the milk did not taste at all nice.\\nMilk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.\\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room.\\nHis father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor\\'s mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard.\\nGregor\\'s sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times.\\nIt was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat.\\n\"What a quiet life it is the family lead\", said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents.\\nBut what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end?\\nThat was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the room.\\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it.\\nGregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain.\\nThe previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.\\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe.\\nIt was clear that no-one would come into Gregor\\'s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\\nFor some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he had been living in it for five years.\\nHardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch.\\nIt pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\\nHe spent the whole night there.\\nSome of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in.\\nShe did not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to be somewhere, for God\\'s sake, he couldn\\'t have flown away - she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside.\\nBut she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.\\nGregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her.\\nWould she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable?\\nIf she didn\\'t do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at his sister\\'s feet and beg her for something good to eat.\\nHowever, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise.\\nShe immediately picked it up - using a rag, not her bare hands - and carried it out.\\nGregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring.\\nIn order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper.\\nThere were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt.\\nAs well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor\\'s use, and placed it beside them.\\nThen, out of consideration for Gregor\\'s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked.\\nGregor\\'s little legs whirred, at last he could eat.\\nWhat\\'s more, his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving.\\nThis amazed him, as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.\\n\"Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?\", he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper.\\nQuickly one after another, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn\\'t like at all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn\\'t stand the smell.\\nLong after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw.\\nHe was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch.\\nBut he needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space.\\nHalf suffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more.\\nShe quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.\\nShe had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.\\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor\\'s sister would send the maid away on some errand.\\nGregor\\'s father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.\\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat.\\nAs nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister\\'s sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room.\\nIt was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything - there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly.\\n\"He\\'s enjoyed his dinner today\", she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, \"now everything\\'s just been left there again\".\\nAlthough Gregor wasn\\'t able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it.\\nThere was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret.\\nFor two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.\\nAnd on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor\\'s mother to let her go without delay.\\nIt was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor\\'s mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.\\nShe even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\\nNow Gregor\\'s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking; although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.\\nGregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than \"no thanks, I\\'ve had enoug.\"\\nor something similar.\\nNo-one drank very much either.\\nHis sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself.\\nWhen his father then said nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with a big, loud \"No\", and no more would be said.\\nEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to Gregor\\'s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.\\nNow and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier.\\nGregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted.\\nWhat he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room.\\nHe had thought that nothing at all remained from his father\\'s business, at least he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.\\nTheir business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor\\'s only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible.\\nSo then he started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways.\\nGregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family.\\nThey had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them.\\nThey had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.\\nGregor only remained close to his sister now.\\nUnlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way.\\nDuring Gregor\\'s short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.\\nTheir parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.\\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.\\nThere were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent.\\n\"What\\'s that he\\'s doing now\", his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.\\nWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Gregor\\'s mother did not understand everything the first time.\\nFrom these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days.\\nIt was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.\\nBesides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating.\\nBehind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.\\nHe could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father\\'s debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things.\\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more.\\nThat\\'s to say, it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned.\\nHis father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence.\\nDuring the five years that he had not been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success - he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy.\\nWould Gregor\\'s elderly mother now have to go and earn money?\\nShe suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.\\nWould his sister have to go and earn money?\\nShe was still a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin.\\nWhenever they began to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret.\\nHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.\\nOr he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.\\nHe had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced,  as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably.\\nHis observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.\\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it; but as it was it caused him pain.\\nHis sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better.\\nIt had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room.\\nNo sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Gregor\\'s room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.\\nEven if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while.\\nShe would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed.\\nOne day, about a month after Gregor\\'s transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible.\\nIn itself, his sister\\'s not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her.\\nGregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual.\\nIt made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch.\\nOne day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.\\nIf she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely.\\nShe left the sheet where it was.\\nGregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement.\\nFor the first fourteen days, Gregor\\'s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him.\\nHe would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her.\\nBut now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor\\'s room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen.\\nHis mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it.\\nGregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully.\\nLater, though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out: \"Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!\\nCan\\'t you understand I have to see him?\", and Gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult\\'s appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\\nGregor\\'s wish to see his mother was soon realised.\\nOut of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.\\nHe was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash.\\nBut now, of course, he had far better control of his body than before and, even with a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage.\\nVery soon his sister noticed Gregor\\'s new way of entertaining himself - he had, after all, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about - and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and the desk.\\nNow, this was not something that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregor\\'s father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.\\nAs she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.\\nFirst, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her mother enter.\\nGregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance.\\nGregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come.\\n\"You can come in, he can\\'t be seen\", said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand.\\nThe old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother\\'s warnings that she would strain herself.\\nThis lasted a very long time.\\nAfter labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor\\'s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn\\'t even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him.\\nShe thought just the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn\\'t Gregor feel the same way about it, he\\'d been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.\\nThen, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her words, she added \"and by taking the furniture away, won\\'t it seem like we\\'re showing that we\\'ve given up all hope of improvement and we\\'re abandoning him to cope for himself?\\nI think it\\'d be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he\\'ll find everything unchanged and he\\'ll be able to forget the time in between all the easier\".\\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made him confused - he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out.\\nHad he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited?\\nThat would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human.\\nHe had come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it.\\nNothing should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.\\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor\\'s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him.\\nThis meant that his mother\\'s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch.\\nIt was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.\\nGirls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can.\\nPerhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor\\'s situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him.\\nGrete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself.\\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her.\\nGregor\\'s mother already looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped Gregor\\'s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had.\\nThe chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay.\\nHardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it.\\nHe meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch.\\nHis mother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch.\\nIn his startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little.\\nIt was enough to attract his mother\\'s attention.\\nShe stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete.\\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.\\nWith his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer.\\nThey were emptying his room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school--he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women\\'s intentions were good.\\nHe had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor.\\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it - of the lady dressed in copious fur.\\nHe hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly.\\nThis picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no-one.\\nHe turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back.\\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.\\n\"What shall we take now, then?\", said Grete and looked around.\\nHer eyes met those of Gregor on the wall.\\nPerhaps only because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: \"Come on, let\\'s go back in the living room for a while?\"\\nGregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall.\\nWell, she could certainly try it!\\nHe sat unyielding on his picture.\\nHe would rather jump at Grete\\'s face.\\nBut Grete\\'s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed: \"Oh God, oh God.\"\\nArms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.\\n\"Gregor.\"\\nshouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.\\nThat was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation.\\nShe ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut Gregor\\'s face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door shut with her foot.\\nSo now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.\\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybe that was a good sign.\\nThen there was someone at the door.\\nThe maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it.\\nHis father had arrived home.\\n\"What\\'s happened?\"\\nwere his first words; Grete\\'s appearance must have made everything clear to him.\\nShe answered him with subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: \"Mother\\'s fainted, but she\\'s better now.\\nGregor got out.\"\\n\"Just as I expected\", said his father, \"just as I always said, but you women wouldn\\'t listen, would you.\"\\nIt was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.\\nThat meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible.\\nSo he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear.\\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that; \"Ah!\", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time.\\nGregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father.\\nHe really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before.\\nHe really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?\\nThe same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him.\\nHe was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp.\\nHe took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Gregor.\\nHe probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.\\nGregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him.\\nAnd so he ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly.\\nIn this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly.\\nGregor remained all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling.\\nWhatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements.\\nHe became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable.\\nNow, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and rolled in front of him.\\nIt was an apple; then another one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him.\\nHe had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another.\\nThese little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors.\\nAn apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor\\'s back and slid off without doing any harm.\\nAnother one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.\\nThe last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him totally - now Gregor lost his ability to see anything - her hands behind his father\\'s head begging him to spare Gregor\\'s life.\\nIII   No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor\\'s flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury.\\nHe had suffered it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy.\\nOn the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility - probably permanently.\\nHe had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but this deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.\\nHe got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation - with everyone\\'s permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before.\\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.\\nAll of them were usually very quiet nowadays.\\nSoon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on.\\nSometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor\\'s mother \"you\\'re doing so much sewing again today!\", as if he did not know that he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.\\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor\\'s father refused to take his uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor\\'s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here.\\nThe uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor\\'s mother and sister to look after it.\\nGregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.\\nAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor\\'s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn\\'t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.\\nBut since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed.\\nThen, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.\\nGregor\\'s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor\\'s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect on him.\\nHe would just sink deeper into his chair.\\nOnly when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: \"What a life!\\nThis is what peace I get in my old age.\"\\nAnd supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor\\'s mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.\\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary?\\nThe household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor\\'s mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did.\\nGregor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations.\\nBut the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address.\\nHe could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to.\\nThey carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Gregor\\'s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more.\\nAnd the injury in Gregor\\'s back began to hurt as much as when it was new.\\nAfter they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor\\'s mother and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would point to Gregor\\'s room and say \"Close that door, Grete\", and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.\\nGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.\\nSometimes he would think of taking over the family\\'s affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow, - all of them appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared.\\nOther times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry.\\nGregor\\'s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or - more often than not - had been left totally untouched.\\nShe still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it.\\nSmears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth.\\nAt first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.\\nAt the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up Gregor\\'s room was for her and her alone.\\nGregor\\'s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.\\nBut his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in Gregor\\'s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke into convulsive tears.\\nHer father, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor\\'s father, standing to the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor\\'s room to his sister; from her left, Gregor\\'s sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor\\'s room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise.\\nGregor\\'s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.\\nGregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected.\\nNow, though, the charwoman was here.\\nThis elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn\\'t really repelled by Gregor.\\nJust by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor\\'s room and found herself face to face with him.\\nHe was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her.\\nFrom then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.\\nAt first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly, such as \"come on then, you old dung-beetle!\", or \"look at the old dung-beetle there.\"\\nGregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened.\\nIf only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it!\\nOne day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to speak to him in that way once again.\\nGregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like a kind of attack.\\nInstead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor\\'s back.\\n\"Aren\\'t you coming any closer, then?\", she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.\\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating.\\nOnly if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.\\nAt first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there.\\nThey had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen.\\nThese earnest gentlemen - all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day - were painfully insistent on things\\' being tidy.\\nThis meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen.\\nUnnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty.\\nThey had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them.\\nFor this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard.\\nAll these things found their way into Gregor\\'s room.\\nThe dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too.\\nThe charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn\\'t use for the time being she would just chuck in there.\\nHe, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it.\\nThe woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else.\\nAt first he moved it because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.\\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.\\nBut Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner.\\nOne time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.\\nThey sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks.\\nGregor\\'s mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes.\\nThe food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell.\\nThe gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen.\\nIt was to his satisfaction, and Gregor\\'s mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled.\\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen.\\nNonetheless, Gregor\\'s father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table.\\nThe gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards.\\nThen, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence.\\nIt seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be.\\n\"I\\'d like to eat something\", said Gregor anxiously, \"but not anything like they\\'re eating.\\nThey do feed themselves.\\nAnd here I am, dying.\"\\nThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen.\\nThe three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking.\\nWhen the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other.\\nSomeone must have heard them in the kitchen, as Gregor\\'s father called out: \"Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen?\\nWe can stop it straight away.\"\\n\"On the contrary\", said the middle gentleman, \"would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?\"\\n\"Oh yes, we\\'d love to\", called back Gregor\\'s father as if he had been the violin player himself.\\nThe gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.\\nGregor\\'s father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with the violin.\\nShe calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out of the way in a corner.\\nHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands.\\nDrawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room.\\nBefore, he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others.\\nWhat\\'s more, there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day.\\nAnd despite this condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room.\\nNo-one noticed him, though.\\nThe family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor\\'s sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor\\'s father observed them anxiously.\\nIt really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed.\\nIt was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.\\nYet Gregor\\'s sister was playing so beautifully.\\nHer face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression.\\nGregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.\\nWas he an animal if music could captivate him so?\\nIt seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for.\\nHe was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would.\\nHe never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already?\\n- if this misfortune hadn\\'t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it.\\nOn hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.\\n\"Mr.\\nSamsa!\", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor\\'s father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward.\\nThe violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.\\nHis father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been.\\nHe rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body.\\nNow they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father\\'s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it.\\nThey asked Gregor\\'s father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly.\\nMeanwhile Gregor\\'s sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted.\\nShe had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the instrument on her mother\\'s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\\nUnder his sister\\'s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room.\\nGregor\\'s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants.\\nHe urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor\\'s father to a halt.\\n\"I declare here and now\", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor\\'s mother and sister to gain their attention too, \"that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this famil.\"\\n- here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - \"I give immediate notice on my room.\\nFor the days that I have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.\"\\nHe was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something.\\nAnd indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: \"And we also give immediate notice.\"\\nWith that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.\\nGregor\\'s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.\\nThroughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him.\\nHis disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to move.\\nHe was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited.\\nHe was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother\\'s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.\\n\"Father, Mother\", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as introduction, \"we can\\'t carry on like this.\\nMaybe you can\\'t see it, but I can.\\nI don\\'t want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it.\\nWe\\'ve done all that\\'s humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don\\'t think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.\"\\n\"She\\'s absolutely right\", said Gregor\\'s father to himself.\\nHis mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes.\\nGregor\\'s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.\\nHer words seemed to give Gregor\\'s father some more definite ideas.\\nHe sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.\\n\"We have to try and get rid of it\", said Gregor\\'s sister, now speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, \"it\\'ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming.\\nWe can\\'t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this, we can\\'t endure it.\\nI can\\'t endure it any more.\"\\nAnd she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.\\n\"My child\", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, \"what are we to do?\"\\nHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.\\n\"If he could just understand us\", said his father almost as a question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question.\\n\"If he could just understand us\", repeated Gregor\\'s father, closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister\\'s certainty that that was quite impossible, \"then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him.\\nBut as it is ...\"\\n\"It\\'s got to go\", shouted his sister, \"that\\'s the only way, Father.\\nYou\\'ve got to get rid of the idea that that\\'s Gregor.\\nWe\\'ve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long.\\nHow can that be Gregor?\\nIf it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it\\'s not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will.\\nWe wouldn\\'t have a brother any more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect.\\nAs it is this animal is persecuting us, it\\'s driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets.\\nFather, look, just look\", she suddenly screamed, \"he\\'s starting again.\"\\nIn her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor\\'s comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor.\\nShe rushed over to behind her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Gregor\\'s sister as if to protect her.\\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister.\\nAll he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor.\\nHe stopped and looked round.\\nThey seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.\\nNow they all looked at him in unhappy silence.\\nHis mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck.\\n\"Maybe now they\\'ll let me turn round\", thought Gregor and went back to work.\\nHe could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest.\\nNo-one was making him rush any more, everything was left up to him.\\nAs soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead.\\nHe was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it.\\nHe concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.\\nHe did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.\\nHe did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up.\\nWith his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.\\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked.\\nThe sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him.\\nIt was his sister who had been in so much of a rush.\\nShe had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents \"At last!\".\\n\"What now, then?\", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness.\\nHe soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all.\\nThis was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural.\\nHe also felt relatively comfortable.\\nIt is true that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.\\nHe could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust.\\nHe thought back of his family with emotion and love.\\nIf it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister.\\nHe remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.\\nHe watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too.\\nThen, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.\\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning - they\\'d often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she\\'d arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special.\\nShe thought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to him.\\nShe happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.\\nWhen she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.\\nShe soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: \"Come and \\'ave a look at this, it\\'s dead, just lying there, stone dead.\"\\nMr.\\nand  Mrs.\\nSamsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying.\\nBut then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed.\\nMr.\\nSamsa threw the blanket over his shoulders,  Mrs.\\nSamsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went into Gregor\\'s room.\\nOn the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.\\n\"Dead?\", asked  Mrs.\\nSamsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking.\\n\"That\\'s what I said\",  replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor\\'s body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.\\nMrs.\\nSamsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it.\\n\"Now then\", said  Mr.\\nSamsa, \"let\\'s give thanks to God for that\".\\nHe crossed himself, and the three women followed his example.\\nGrete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: \"Just look how thin he was.\\nHe didn\\'t eat anything for so long.\\nThe food came out again just the same as when it went in\".\\nGregor\\'s body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away.\\n\"Grete, come with us in here for a little while\", said  Mrs.\\nSamsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body.\\nThe cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide.\\nAlthough it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.\\nIt was already the end of March, after all.\\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts;  they had been forgotten about.\\n\"Where is our breakfast?\", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.\\nShe just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor\\'s room.\\nThey did so, and stood around Gregor\\'s corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats.\\nIt was now quite light in the room.\\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr.\\nSamsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.\\nAll of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face against her father\\'s arm.\\n\"Leave my home.\\nNow!\", said  Mr.\\nSamsa, indicating the door and without letting the women from him.\\n\"What do you mean?\", asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly.\\nThe other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour.\\n\"I mean just what I said\", answered  Mr.\\nSamsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man.\\nAt first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions.\\n\"Alright, we\\'ll go then\", he said, and looked up at  Mr.\\nSamsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr.\\nSamsa for his decision.\\nMr.\\nSamsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times.\\nAt that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said.\\nNow they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.\\nSamsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader.\\nOnce there, all three took their hats from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the premises.\\nMr.\\nSamsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men\\'s intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps.\\nAs they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher\\'s boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were,  Mr.\\nSamsa and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.\\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it.\\nSo they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal,  Mr.\\nSamsa to his employers,  Mrs.\\nSamsa to her contractor and Grete to her principal.\\nThe cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she\\'d finished her work for that morning.\\nThe three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation.\\n\"Well?\", asked  Mr.\\nSamsa.\\nThe charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to.\\nThe almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to  Mr.\\nSamsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions.\\n\"What is it you want then?\", asked  Mrs.\\nSamsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for.\\n\"Yes\", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, \"well then, that thing in there, you needn\\'t worry about how you\\'re going to get rid of it.\\nThat\\'s all been sorted out.\"\\nMrs.\\nSamsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing;  Mr.\\nSamsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to.\\nSo, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out \"Cheerio then, everyone\", turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\\n\"Tonight she gets sacked\", said  Mr.\\nSamsa, but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained.\\nThey got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other.\\nMr.\\nSamsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while.\\nThen he called out: \"Come here, then.\\nLet\\'s forget about all that old stuff, shall we.\\nCome and give me a bit of attention\".\\nThe two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters.\\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town.\\nThey had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves.\\nLeant back comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad - until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future.\\nThe greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical.\\nAll the time, Grete was becoming livelier.\\nWith all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking,  Mr.\\nand  Mrs.\\nSamsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.\\nThey became quieter.\\nJust from each other\\'s glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her.\\nAnd, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.\\n\\nProduced by Judith Boss, Christy Phillips, Lynn Hanninen, and David Meltzer.\\nHTML version by Al Haines.\\nFrankenstein,  or the Modern Prometheus   by  Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley     Letter 1   St.\\nPetersburgh, Dec.\\n11th, 17--  TO Mrs.\\nSaville, England  You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.\\nI arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.\\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.\\nDo you understand this feeling?\\nThis breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid.\\nI try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.\\nThere, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.\\nThere--for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators--there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.\\nIts productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.\\nWhat may not be expected in a country of eternal light?\\nI may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever.\\nI shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.\\nThese are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river.\\nBut supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose--a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.\\nThis expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.\\nI have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole.\\nYou may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas\\' library.\\nMy education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading.\\nThese volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father\\'s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.\\nI also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.\\nYou are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.\\nI can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.\\nI commenced by inuring my body to hardship.\\nI accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.\\nTwice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.\\nI must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path.\\nOh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative!\\nMy courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.\\nI am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude:  I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.\\nThey fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.\\nThe cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs--a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.\\nI have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St.\\nPetersburgh and Archangel.\\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing.\\nI do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return?\\nAh, dear sister, how can I answer this question?\\nIf I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet.\\nIf I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.\\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret.\\nHeaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.\\nYour affectionate brother,   R.\\nWalton    Letter 2   Archangel, 28th March, 17--  To Mrs.\\nSaville, England  How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.\\nI have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.\\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret:  when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.\\nI shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.\\nI desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine.\\nYou may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend.\\nI have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans.\\nHow would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother!\\nI am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.\\nBut it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated:  for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas\\' books of voyages.\\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country.\\nNow I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.\\nIt is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) KEEPING; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.\\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.\\nYet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms.\\nMy lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession.\\nHe is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity.\\nI first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.\\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.\\nThis circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him.\\nA youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship:  I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.\\nI heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.\\nThis, briefly, is his story.\\nSome years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.\\nHe saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union.\\nMy generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit.\\nHe had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman\\'s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.\\nBut the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.\\n\"What a noble fellow.\"\\nyou will exclaim.\\nHe is so; but then he is wholly uneducated:  he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.\\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions.\\nThose are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.\\nThe winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected.\\nI shall do nothing rashly:  you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.\\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.\\nIt is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart.\\nI am going to unexplored regions, to \"the land of mist and snow.\"\\nbut I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the \"Ancient Mariner.\"\\nYou will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret.\\nI have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets.\\nThere is something at work in my soul which I do not understand.\\nI am practically industrious--painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour--but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore.\\nBut to return to dearer considerations.\\nShall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?\\nI dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture.\\nContinue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits.\\nI love you very tenderly.\\nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\\nYour affectionate brother,   Robert Walton    Letter 3    July 7th, 17--  To Mrs.\\nSaville, England  My dear Sister,  I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe--and well advanced on my voyage.\\nThis letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years.\\nI am, however, in good spirits:  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them.\\nWe have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.\\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.\\nOne or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\\nAdieu, my dear Margaret.\\nBe assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger.\\nI will be cool, persevering, and prudent.\\nBut success SHALL crown my endeavours.\\nWherefore not?\\nThus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.\\nWhy not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?\\nWhat can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?\\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.\\nBut I must finish.\\nHeaven bless my beloved sister!\\nR.W.\\nLetter 4    August 5th, 17--  To Mrs.\\nSaville, England  So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.\\nLast Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated.\\nOur situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog.\\nWe accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.\\nAbout two o\\'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end.\\nSome of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation.\\nWe perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.\\nWe watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.\\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder.\\nWe were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed.\\nShut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.\\nAbout two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.\\nWe, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice.\\nI profited of this time to rest for a few hours.\\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea.\\nIt was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice.\\nOnly one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\\nHe was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European.\\nWhen I appeared on deck the master said, \"Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.\"\\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.\\n\"Before I come on board your vessel.\"\\nsaid he, \"will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?\"\\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.\\nI replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.\\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\\nGood God!\\nMargaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.\\nHis limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.\\nI never saw a man in so wretched a condition.\\nWe attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted.\\nWe accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.\\nAs soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove.\\nBy slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.\\nTwo days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.\\nWhen he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit.\\nI never saw a more interesting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.\\nBut he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\\nOnce, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.\\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, \"To seek one who fled from me.\"\\n\"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.\"\\nThis aroused the stranger\\'s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had pursued.\\nSoon after, when he was alone with me, he said, \"I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.\"\\n\"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.\"\\n\"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.\"\\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.\\nI replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.\\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.\\nHe manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\\nI have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.\\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day.\\nThe stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.\\nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him.\\nFor my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.\\nHe must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.\\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.\\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.\\nAugust 13th, 17--  My affection for my guest increases every day.\\nHe excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.\\nHow can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?\\nHe is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.\\nHe is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.\\nYet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others.\\nHe has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise.\\nHe entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it.\\nI was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise.\\nOne man\\'s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.\\nAs I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener\\'s countenance.\\nAt first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast.\\nI paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents:  \"Unhappy man!\\nDo you share my madness?\\nHave you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?\\nHear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips.\"\\nSuch words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.\\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.\\nHe asked me the history of my earlier years.\\nThe tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection.\\nI spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\\n\"I agree with you.\"\\nreplied the stranger; \"we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves--such a friend ought to be--do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.\\nI once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship.\\nYou have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair.\\nBut I--I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.\"\\nAs he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart.\\nBut he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.\\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature.\\nThe starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.\\nSuch a man has a double existence:  he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.\\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?\\nYou would not if you saw him.\\nYou have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.\\nSometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.\\nI believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.\\nAugust 19, 17--  Yesterday the stranger said to me, \"You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.\\nI had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination.\\nYou seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.\\nI do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.\\nPrepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.\\nWere we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.\"\\nYou may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes.\\nI felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.\\nI expressed these feelings in my answer.\\n\"I thank you.\"\\nhe replied, \"for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.\\nI wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace.\\nI understand your feeling.\"\\ncontinued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; \"but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.\"\\nHe then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure.\\nThis promise drew from me the warmest thanks.\\nI have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day.\\nIf I should be engaged, I will at least make notes.\\nThis manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips--with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day!\\nEven now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.\\nStrange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it--thus!\\nMy ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.\\nHe was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.\\nHe passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.\\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them.\\nOne of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.\\nThis man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.\\nHaving paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.\\nMy father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them.\\nHe lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.\\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode.\\nOverjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss.\\nBut when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.\\nBeaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant\\'s house.\\nThe interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support.\\nBut Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity.\\nShe procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.\\nSeveral months passed in this manner.\\nHer father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar.\\nThis last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort\\'s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber.\\nHe came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation.\\nTwo years after this event Caroline became his wife.\\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.\\nThere was a sense of justice in my father\\'s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly.\\nPerhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth.\\nThere was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.\\nEverything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.\\nHe strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind.\\nHer health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.\\nDuring the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.\\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France.\\nI, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.\\nI remained for several years their only child.\\nMuch as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me.\\nMy mother\\'s tender caresses and my father\\'s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.\\nI was their plaything and their idol, and something better--their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.\\nWith this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.\\nFor a long time I was their only care.\\nMy mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring.\\nWhen I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como.\\nTheir benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.\\nThis, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion--remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved--for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted.\\nDuring one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape.\\nOne day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode.\\nShe found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes.\\nAmong these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest.\\nShe appeared of a different stock.\\nThe four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair.\\nHer hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head.\\nHer brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\\nThe peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.\\nShe was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman.\\nHer mother was a German and had died on giving her birth.\\nThe infant had been placed with these good people to nurse:  they were better off then.\\nThey had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born.\\nThe father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy--one among the schiavi ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country.\\nHe became the victim of its weakness.\\nWhether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known.\\nHis property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar.\\nShe continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub--a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills.\\nThe apparition was soon explained.\\nWith his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.\\nThey were fond of the sweet orphan.\\nHer presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection.\\nThey consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents\\' house--my more than sister--the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.\\nEveryone loved Elizabeth.\\nThe passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight.\\nOn the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, \"I have a pretty present for my Victor--tomorrow he shall have it.\"\\nAnd when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine--mine to protect, love, and cherish.\\nAll praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own.\\nWe called each other familiarly by the name of cousin.\\nNo word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me--my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.\\nI need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.\\nHarmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together.\\nElizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home --the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers--she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes.\\nThe world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.\\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country.\\nWe possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city.\\nWe resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.\\nIt was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.\\nI was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.\\nHenry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.\\nHe was a boy of singular talent and fancy.\\nHe loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake.\\nHe was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.\\nHe composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure.\\nHe tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.\\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.\\nMy parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed.\\nWhen I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.\\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately.\\nI confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me.\\nIt was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.\\nThe busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.\\nThe saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.\\nShe was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.\\nAnd Clerval--could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?\\nYet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.\\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.\\nBesides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science.\\nWhen I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.\\nIn this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.\\nI opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.\\nA new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father.\\nMy father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, \"Ah!\\nCornelius Agrippa!\\nMy dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.\"\\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.\\nIt is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.\\nBut the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.\\nWhen I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.\\nI read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself.\\nI have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature.\\nIn spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.\\nSir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.\\nThose of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy\\'s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.\\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses.\\nThe most learned philosopher knew little more.\\nHe had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.\\nHe might dissect, anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.\\nI had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.\\nBut here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.\\nI took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.\\nIt may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies.\\nMy father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child\\'s blindness, added to a student\\'s thirst for knowledge.\\nUnder the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher\\'s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.\\nWealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!\\nNor were these my only visions.\\nThe raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.\\nAnd thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.\\nWhen I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.\\nIt advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.\\nI remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.\\nAs I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump.\\nWhen we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.\\nIt was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.\\nI never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.\\nBefore this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.\\nOn this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.\\nAll that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies.\\nIt seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known.\\nAll that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.\\nBy one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge.\\nIn this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.\\nThus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin.\\nWhen I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life--the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.\\nHer victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.\\nIt was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.\\nIt was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.\\nDestiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.\\nI had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.\\nMy departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred--an omen, as it were, of my future misery.\\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger.\\nDuring her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.\\nShe had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety.\\nShe attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper--Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.\\nOn the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event.\\nOn her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her.\\nShe joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself.\\n\"My children.\"\\nshe said, \"my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union.\\nThis expectation will now be the consolation of your father.\\nElizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children.\\nAlas!\\nI regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?\\nBut these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.\"\\nShe died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.\\nIt is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed forever--that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard.\\nThese are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.\\nYet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?\\nAnd why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?\\nThe time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished.\\nMy mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.\\nMy departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon.\\nI obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.\\nIt appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life.\\nI was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.\\nI was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.\\nShe indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.\\nShe looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.\\nShe devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins.\\nNever was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.\\nShe forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.\\nThe day of my departure at length arrived.\\nClerval spent the last evening with us.\\nHe had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.\\nHis father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.\\nHenry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.\\nHe said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.\\nWe sat late.\\nWe could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word \"Farewell.\"\\nIt was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morning\\'s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there--my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\\nI threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections.\\nI, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure--I was now alone.\\nIn the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector.\\nMy life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.\\nI loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were \"old familiar faces.\"\\nbut I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.\\nSuch were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.\\nI ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.\\nI had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.\\nNow my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.\\nI had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.\\nAt length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes.\\nI alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.\\nThe next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.\\nChance--or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father\\'s door--led me first to M.\\nKrempe, professor of natural philosophy.\\nHe was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.\\nHe asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.\\nI replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied.\\nThe professor stared.\\n\"Have you.\"\\nhe said, \"really spent your time in studying such nonsense?\"\\nI replied in the affirmative.\\n\"Every minute.\"\\ncontinued M.\\nKrempe with warmth, \"every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.\\nYou have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names.\\nGood God!\\nIn what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient?\\nI little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.\\nMy dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.\"\\nSo saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M.\\nWaldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.\\nI returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.\\nM.\\nKrempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits.\\nIn rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years.\\nAs a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.\\nWith a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\\nBesides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\\nIt was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed.\\nThe ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded.\\nI was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.\\nSuch were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode.\\nBut as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M.\\nKrempe had given me concerning the lectures.\\nAnd although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\\nPartly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M.\\nWaldman entered shortly after.\\nThis professor was very unlike his colleague.\\nHe appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black.\\nHis person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\\nHe began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.\\nHe then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms.\\nAfter having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget:  \"The ancient teachers of this science.\"\\nsaid he, \"promised impossibilities and performed nothing.\\nThe modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.\\nThey penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places.\\nThey ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.\\nThey have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.\"\\nSuch were the professor\\'s words--rather let me say such the words of the fate--enounced to destroy me.\\nAs he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose.\\nSo much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein--more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\\nI closed not my eyes that night.\\nMy internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it.\\nBy degrees, after the morning\\'s dawn, sleep came.\\nI awoke, and my yesternight\\'s thoughts were as a dream.\\nThere only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent.\\nOn the same day I paid M.\\nWaldman a visit.\\nHis manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.\\nI gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor.\\nHe heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M.\\nKrempe had exhibited.\\nHe said that \"These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge.\\nThey had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.\\nThe labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.\"\\nI listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours.\\nI requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.\\n\"I am happy.\"\\nsaid M.\\nWaldman, \"to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.\\nChemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science.\\nA man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.\\nIf your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.\"\\nHe then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.\\nHe also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave.\\nThus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.\\nI attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M.\\nKrempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.\\nIn M.\\nWaldman I found a true friend.\\nHis gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.\\nIn a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.\\nMy application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.\\nMy ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters.\\nProfessor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M.\\nWaldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.\\nTwo years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make.\\nNone but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.\\nIn other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university.\\nWhen I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.\\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life.\\nWhence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.\\nI revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology.\\nUnless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.\\nTo examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.\\nI became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.\\nI do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.\\nDarkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.\\nNow I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses.\\nMy attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.\\nI saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.\\nI paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me--a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.\\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.\\nThe sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true.\\nSome miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable.\\nAfter days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.\\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture.\\nAfter so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.\\nBut this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp.\\nNot that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once:  the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.\\nI was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.\\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject.\\nI will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery.\\nLearn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.\\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\\nAlthough I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.\\nI doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.\\nThe materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed.\\nI prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.\\nNor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.\\nIt was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being.\\nAs the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.\\nAfter having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.\\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.\\nLife and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.\\nA new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.\\nNo father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.\\nPursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour.\\nMy cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement.\\nSometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize.\\nOne secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.\\nWho shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?\\nMy limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.\\nIt was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits.\\nI collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame.\\nIn a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.\\nThe dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.\\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit.\\nIt was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.\\nAnd the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time.\\nI knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father:  \"I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you.\\nYou must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.\"\\nI knew well therefore what would be my father\\'s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.\\nI wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.\\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame.\\nA human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.\\nI do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.\\nIf the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind.\\nIf this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.\\nMy father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves--sights which before always yielded me supreme delight--so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.\\nThe leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded.\\nBut my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.\\nEvery night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.\\nSometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me:  my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.\\nWith an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.\\nIt was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?\\nHis limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful.\\nBeautiful!\\nGreat God!\\nHis yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.\\nI had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.\\nFor this I had deprived myself of rest and health.\\nI had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.\\nUnable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.\\nAt length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\\nBut it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams.\\nI thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt.\\nDelighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\\nI started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch--the miserable monster whom I had created.\\nHe held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.\\nHis jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.\\nHe might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.\\nI took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.\\nOh!\\nNo mortal could support the horror of that countenance.\\nA mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.\\nI had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.\\nI passed the night wretchedly.\\nSometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.\\nMingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!\\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.\\nThe porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view.\\nI did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.\\nI continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.\\nI traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.\\nMy heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:     Like one who, on a lonely road,   Doth walk in fear and dread,   And, having once turned round, walks on,   And turns no more his head;   Because he knows a frightful fiend   Doth close behind him tread.\\n[Coleridge\\'s \"Ancient Mariner.\"]   Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped.\\nHere I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.\\nAs it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out.\\n\"My dear Frankenstein.\"\\nexclaimed he, \"how glad I am to see you!\\nHow fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting.\"\\nNothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.\\nI grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy.\\nI welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college.\\nClerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt.\\n\"You may easily believe.\"\\nsaid he, \"how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield:  \\'I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.\\'\\nBut his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.\"\\n\"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.\"\\n\"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom.\\nBy the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.\\nBut, my dear Frankenstein.\"\\ncontinued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, \"I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights.\"\\n\"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free.\"\\nI trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.\\nI walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.\\nI then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.\\nI dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\\nEntreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room.\\nMy hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.\\nI then paused, and a cold shivering came over me.\\nI threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.\\nI stepped fearfully in:  the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.\\nI could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.\\nWe ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself.\\nIt was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly.\\nI was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\\nClerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.\\n\"My dear Victor.\"\\ncried he, \"what, for God\\'s sake, is the matter?\\nDo not laugh in that manner.\\nHow ill you are!\\nWhat is the cause of all this?\"\\n\"Do not ask me.\"\\ncried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; \"HE can tell.\\nOh, save me!\\nSave me.\"\\nI imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.\\nPoor Clerval!\\nWhat must have been his feelings?\\nA meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.\\nBut I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.\\nThis was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months.\\nDuring all that time Henry was my only nurse.\\nI afterwards learned that, knowing my father\\'s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder.\\nHe knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.\\nBut I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\\nThe form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was forever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.\\nDoubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\\nBy very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered.\\nI remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.\\nIt was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence.\\nI felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\\n\"Dearest Clerval.\"\\nexclaimed I, \"how kind, how very good you are to me.\\nThis whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.\\nHow shall I ever repay you?\\nI feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.\"\\n\"You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?\"\\nI trembled.\\nOne subject!\\nWhat could it be?\\nCould he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?\\n\"Compose yourself.\"\\nsaid Clerval, who observed my change of colour, \"I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.\\nThey hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.\"\\n\"Is that all, my dear Henry?\\nHow could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?\"\\n\"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe.\"\\nIt was from my own Elizabeth:  \"My dearest Cousin,  \"You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.\\nYou are forbidden to write--to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions.\\nFor a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.\\nI have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself!\\nI figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin.\\nYet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better.\\nI eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.\\n\"Get well--and return to us.\\nYou will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly.\\nYour father\\'s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.\\nHow pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest!\\nHe is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit.\\nHe is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us.\\nMy uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application.\\nHe looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake.\\nI fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\\n\"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us.\\nThe blue lake and snow-clad mountains--they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws.\\nMy trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me.\\nSince you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household.\\nDo you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?\\nProbably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.\\nMadame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third.\\nThis girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M.\\nMoritz, treated her very ill.\\nMy aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.\\nThe republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.\\nHence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral.\\nA servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England.\\nJustine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\\n\"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica--she looked so frank-hearted and happy.\\nMy aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.\\nThis benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\\nAlthough her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.\\nShe thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\\n\"When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection.\\nPoor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.\\n\"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.\\nThe conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality.\\nShe was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived.\\nAccordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother.\\nPoor girl!\\nShe wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity.\\nNor was her residence at her mother\\'s house of a nature to restore her gaiety.\\nThe poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.\\nShe sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.\\nPerpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever.\\nShe died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter.\\nJustine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly.\\nShe is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.\\n\"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William.\\nI wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.\\nWhen he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health.\\nHe has already had one or two little WIVES, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.\\n\"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.\\nThe pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.\\nHer ugly sister, Manon, married M.\\nDuvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.\\nYour favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.\\nBut he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.\\nShe is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody.\\n\"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude.\\nWrite, dearest Victor,--one line--one word will be a blessing to us.\\nTen thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful.\\nAdieu!\\nmy cousin; take care of your self; and, I entreat you, write!\\n\"Elizabeth Lavenza.\\n\"Geneva, March 18, 17--.\"\\n\"Dear, dear Elizabeth.\"\\nI exclaimed, when I had read her letter:  \"I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.\"\\nI wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.\\nIn another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.\\nOne of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university.\\nIn doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.\\nEver since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.\\nWhen I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.\\nHenry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.\\nHe had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.\\nBut these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.\\nM.\\nWaldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences.\\nHe soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.\\nWhat could I do?\\nHe meant to please, and he tormented me.\\nI felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.\\nI writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\\nClerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.\\nI thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.\\nI saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.\\nM.\\nKrempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M.\\nWaldman.\\n\"D--n the fellow.\"\\ncried he; \"why, M.\\nClerval, I assure you he has outstript us all.\\nAy, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.\\nA youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.--Ay, ay.\"\\ncontinued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, \"M.\\nFrankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\\nYoung men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M.\\nClerval:  I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.\"\\nM.\\nKrempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.\\nClerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.\\nHe came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself.\\nResolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.\\nThe Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies.\\nIdleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.\\nI did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement.\\nI read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours.\\nTheir melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.\\nWhen you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,--in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.\\nHow different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.\\nI felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends.\\nMy return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.\\nThe winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.\\nThe month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.\\nI acceded with pleasure to this proposition:  I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\\nWe passed a fortnight in these perambulations:  my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend.\\nStudy had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\\nExcellent friend!\\nhow sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.\\nA selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.\\nWhen happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.\\nA serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.\\nThe present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.\\nI was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.\\nHenry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul.\\nThe resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing:  his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.\\nAt other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.\\nWe returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon:  the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.\\nMy own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.\\nBut that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.\\nWhat would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?\\nAnd how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?\\nAbsence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son?\\nI wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\\n\"William is dead!--that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!\\nVictor, he is murdered!\\n\"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.\\n\"Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais.\\nThe evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual.\\nIt was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found.\\nWe accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.\\nPresently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\\n\"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house.\\nHe was not there.\\nWe returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.\\nAbout five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder\\'s finger was on his neck.\\n\"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.\\nShe was very earnest to see the corpse.\\nAt first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, \\'O God!\\nI have murdered my darling child!\\'\\n\"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.\\nWhen she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh.\\nShe told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother.\\nThis picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.\\nWe have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\\n\"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.\\nShe weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart.\\nWe are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?\\nYour dear mother!\\nAlas, Victor!\\nI now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!\\n\"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds.\\nEnter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.\\n\"Your affectionate and afflicted father,                               \"Alphonse Frankenstein.\\n\"Geneva, May 12th, 17--.\"\\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving new from my friends.\\nI threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.\\n\"My dear Frankenstein.\"\\nexclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, \"are you always to be unhappy?\\nMy dear friend, what has happened?\"\\nI motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation.\\nTears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.\\n\"I can offer you no consolation, my friend.\"\\nsaid he; \"your disaster is irreparable.\\nWhat do you intend to do?\"\\n\"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.\"\\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.\\n\"Poor William.\"\\nsaid he, \"dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!\\nWho that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss!\\nTo die so miserably; to feel the murderer\\'s grasp!\\nHow much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!\\nPoor little fellow!\\none only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest.\\nThe pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.\\nA sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.\\nHe can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.\"\\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude.\\nBut now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.\\nMy journey was very melancholy.\\nAt first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.\\nI could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.\\nI passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.\\nHow altered every thing might be during that time!\\nOne sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.\\nFear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.\\nI remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.\\nI contemplated the lake:  the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, \\'the palaces of nature,\\' were not changed.\\nBy degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.\\nThe road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town.\\nI discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.\\nI wept like a child.\\n\"Dear mountains!\\nmy own beautiful lake!\\nhow do you welcome your wanderer?\\nYour summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.\\nIs this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?\"\\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure.\\nMy country, my beloved country!\\nwho but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!\\nYet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.\\nNight also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily.\\nThe picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.\\nAlas!\\nI prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\\nIt was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.\\nThe sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered.\\nAs I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\\nDuring this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures.\\nThe storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress.\\nIt advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\\nI quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.\\nIt was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash.\\nThe storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.\\nThe most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copet.\\nAnother storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.\\nWhile I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step.\\nThis noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, \"William, dear angel!\\nthis is thy funeral, this thy dirge.\"\\nAs I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently:  I could not be mistaken.\\nA flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy daemon, to whom I had given life.\\nWhat did he there?\\nCould he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?\\nNo sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.\\nThe figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.\\nNothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.\\nHE was the murderer!\\nI could not doubt it.\\nThe mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.\\nI thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Saleve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south.\\nHe soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\\nI remained motionless.\\nThe thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.\\nI revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.\\nTwo years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?\\nAlas!\\nI had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?\\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.\\nBut I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.\\nI considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.\\nDay dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.\\nThe gates were open, and I hastened to my father\\'s house.\\nMy first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made.\\nBut I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.\\nA being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.\\nI remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.\\nI well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.\\nBesides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it.\\nAnd then of what use would be pursuit?\\nWho could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Saleve?\\nThese reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.\\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father\\'s house.\\nI told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.\\nSix years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.\\nBeloved and venerable parent!\\nHe still remained to me.\\nI gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece.\\nIt was an historical subject, painted at my father\\'s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.\\nHer garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.\\nBelow this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.\\nWhile I was thus engaged, Ernest entered:  he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:  \"Welcome, my dearest Victor.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Ah!\\nI wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.\\nYou come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.--Poor William!\\nhe was our darling and our pride.\"\\nTears, unrestrained, fell from my brother\\'s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame.\\nBefore, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster.\\nI tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\\n\"She most of all.\"\\nsaid Ernest, \"requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched.\\nBut since the murderer has been discovered-.\"\\n\"The murderer discovered!\\nGood God!\\nhow can that be?\\nwho could attempt to pursue him?\\nIt is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.\\nI saw him too; he was free last night.\"\\n\"I do not know what you mean.\"\\nreplied my brother, in accents of wonder, \"but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.\\nNo one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.\\nIndeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?\"\\n\"Justine Moritz!\\nPoor, poor girl, is she the accused?\\nBut it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?\"\\n\"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt.\\nBut she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.\"\\nHe then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days.\\nDuring this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.\\nThe servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.\\nOn being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.\\nThis was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, \"You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.\\nJustine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.\"\\nAt that instant my father entered.\\nI saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, \"Good God, papa!\\nVictor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.\"\\n\"We do also, unfortunately.\"\\nreplied my father, \"for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.\"\\n\"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.\"\\n\"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.\\nShe is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.\"\\nThis speech calmed me.\\nI was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.\\nI had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her.\\nMy tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar.\\nDid any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?\\nWe were soon joined by Elizabeth.\\nTime had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years.\\nThere was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\\nShe welcomed me with the greatest affection.\\n\"Your arrival, my dear cousin.\"\\nsaid she, \"fills me with hope.\\nYou perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.\\nAlas!\\nwho is safe, if she be convicted of crime?\\nI rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own.\\nOur misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.\\nIf she is condemned, I never shall know joy more.\\nBut she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.\"\\n\"She is innocent, my Elizabeth.\"\\nsaid I, \"and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.\"\\n\"How kind and generous you are!\\nevery one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible:  and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.\"\\nShe wept.\\n\"Dearest niece.\"\\nsaid my father, \"dry your tears.\\nIf she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.\"\\nMy father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.\\nDuring the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.\\nIt was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings:  one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause!\\nA thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.\\nThe appearance of Justine was calm.\\nShe was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.\\nYet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.\\nShe was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.\\nWhen she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.\\nA tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.\\nThe trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called.\\nSeveral strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had.\\nShe had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.\\nThe woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer.\\nShe returned to the house about eight o\\'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him.\\nWhen shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.\\nThe picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\\nJustine was called on for her defence.\\nAs the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered.\\nSurprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed.\\nSometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.\\n\"God knows.\"\\nshe said, \"how entirely I am innocent.\\nBut I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.\"\\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chene, a village situated at about a league from Geneva.\\nOn her return, at about nine o\\'clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.\\nShe was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.\\nMost of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\\nIt was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother.\\nIf she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.\\nThat she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\\nConcerning the picture she could give no account.\\n\"I know.\"\\ncontinued the unhappy victim, \"how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket.\\nBut here also I am checked.\\nI believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.\\nDid the murderer place it there?\\nI know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?\\n\"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope.\\nI beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.\"\\nSeveral witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.\\nElizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court.\\n\"I am.\"\\nsaid she, \"the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth.\\nIt may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character.\\nI am well acquainted with the accused.\\nI have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years.\\nDuring all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.\\nShe nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle\\'s house, where she was beloved by all the family.\\nShe was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.\\nFor my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence.\\nShe had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.\"\\nA murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth\\'s simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.\\nShe herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.\\nMy own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.\\nI believed in her innocence; I knew it.\\nCould the demon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?\\nI could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony.\\nThe tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\\nI passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.\\nIn the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched.\\nI dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit.\\nThe ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.\\nI cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.\\nI had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured.\\nThe person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\\n\"That evidence.\"\\nhe observed, \"was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.\"\\nThis was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?\\nHad my eyes deceived me?\\nAnd was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?\\nI hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\\n\"My cousin.\"\\nreplied I, \"it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape.\\nBut she has confessed.\"\\nThis was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine\\'s innocence.\\n\"Alas.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"How shall I ever again believe in human goodness?\\nJustine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?\\nHer mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.\"\\nSoon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin.\\nMy father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth, \"I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone.\"\\nThe idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.\\nWe entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees.\\nShe rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.\\nMy cousin wept also.\\n\"Oh, Justine.\"\\nsaid she.\\n\"Why did you rob me of my last consolation?\\nI relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now.\"\\n\"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?\\nDo you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?\"\\nHer voice was suffocated with sobs.\\n\"Rise, my poor girl.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"why do you kneel, if you are innocent?\\nI am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.\\nThat report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.\"\\n\"I did confess, but I confessed a lie.\\nI confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins.\\nThe God of heaven forgive me!\\nEver since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was.\\nHe threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate.\\nDear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.\\nWhat could I do?\\nIn an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.\"\\nShe paused, weeping, and then continued, \"I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.\\nDear William!\\ndearest blessed child!\\nI soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.\"\\n\"Oh, Justine!\\nForgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.\\nWhy did you confess?\\nBut do not mourn, dear girl.\\nDo not fear.\\nI will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.\\nI will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.\\nYou shall not die!\\nYou, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!\\nNo!\\nNo!\\nI never could survive so horrible a misfortune.\"\\nJustine shook her head mournfully.\\n\"I do not fear to die.\"\\nshe said; \"that pang is past.\\nGod raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst.\\nI leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me.\\nLearn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven.\"\\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.\\nDespair!\\nWho dared talk of that?\\nThe poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony.\\nI gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.\\nJustine started.\\nWhen she saw who it was, she approached me and said, \"Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?\"\\nI could not answer.\\n\"No, Justine.\"\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"he is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.\"\\n\"I truly thank him.\\nIn these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.\\nHow sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!\\nIt removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.\"\\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.\\nShe indeed gained the resignation she desired.\\nBut I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation.\\nElizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.\\nAnguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish.\\nWe stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away.\\n\"I wish.\"\\ncried she, \"that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.\"\\nJustine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.\\nShe embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, \"Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer!\\nLive, and be happy, and make others so.\"\\nAnd on the morrow Justine died.\\nElizabeth\\'s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.\\nMy passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them.\\nAnd when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips.\\nThus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.\\nShe perished on the scaffold as a murderess!\\nFrom the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.\\nThis also was my doing!\\nAnd my father\\'s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands!\\nYe weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears!\\nAgain shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!\\nFrankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you--he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!\\nThus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\\nJustine died, she rested, and I was alive.\\nThe blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.\\nSleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind.\\nYet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.\\nI had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.\\nNow all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.\\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.\\nI shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation--deep, dark, deathlike solitude.\\nMy father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.\\n\"Do you think, Victor.\"\\nsaid he, \"that I do not suffer also?\\nNo one could love a child more than I loved your brother\"--tears came into his eyes as he spoke--\"but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?\\nIt is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.\"\\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations.\\nNow I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.\\nAbout this time we retired to our house at Belrive.\\nThis change was particularly agreeable to me.\\nThe shutting of the gates regularly at ten o\\'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me.\\nI was now free.\\nOften, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water.\\nSometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.\\nI was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly--if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore--often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities forever.\\nBut I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.\\nI thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?\\nAt these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.\\nBut that could not be.\\nRemorse extinguished every hope.\\nI had been the author of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.\\nI had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.\\nThere was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind.\\nMy abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.\\nWhen I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed.\\nWhen I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.\\nI would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I when there have precipitated him to their base.\\nI wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.\\nOur house was the house of mourning.\\nMy father\\'s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events.\\nElizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.\\nShe was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.\\nThe first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.\\n\"When I reflect, my dear cousin.\"\\nsaid she, \"on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.\\nBefore, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other\\'s blood.\\nYet I am certainly unjust.\\nEverybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.\\nFor the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own!\\nI could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men.\\nBut she was innocent.\\nI know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.\\nAlas!\\nVictor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?\\nI feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.\\nWilliam and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected.\\nBut even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.\"\\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.\\nI, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer.\\nElizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, \"My dearest friend, you must calm yourself.\\nThese events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.\\nThere is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble.\\nDear Victor, banish these dark passions.\\nRemember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.\\nHave we lost the power of rendering you happy?\\nAh!\\nWhile we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing--what can disturb our peace?\"\\nAnd could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart?\\nEven as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.\\nThus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual.\\nI was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.\\nThe wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.\\nSometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations.\\nIt was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows.\\nMy wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix.\\nI had visited it frequently during my boyhood.\\nSix years had passed since then:  _I_ was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.\\nI performed the first part of my journey on horseback.\\nI afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads.\\nThe weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.\\nThe weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve.\\nThe immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence--and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise.\\nStill, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\\nRuined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.\\nBut it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings.\\nI passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it.\\nSoon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.\\nThis valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.\\nThe high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields.\\nImmense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage.\\nMont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley.\\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey.\\nSome turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.\\nThe very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.\\nThen again the kindly influence ceased to act--I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection.\\nThen I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself--or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\\nAt length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.\\nExhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.\\nFor a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.\\nThe same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.\\nI stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.\\nThe abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands.\\nThese sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.\\nThey elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it.\\nIn some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month.\\nI retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day.\\nThey congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds--they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.\\nWhere had they fled when the next morning I awoke?\\nAll of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought.\\nThe rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends.\\nStill I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats.\\nWhat were rain and storm to me?\\nMy mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert.\\nI remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\\nIt had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\\nThe sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life.\\nI determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.\\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain.\\nIt is a scene terrifically desolate.\\nIn a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees.\\nThe path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.\\nThe pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\\nI looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me.\\nAlas!\\nWhy does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings.\\nIf our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.\\nWe rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\\nWe rise; one wand\\'ring thought pollutes the day.\\nWe feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,    Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;   It is the same:  for, be it joy or sorrow,    The path of its departure still is free.\\nMan\\'s yesterday may ne\\'er be like his morrow;    Nought may endure but mutability!\\nIt was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.\\nFor some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.\\nA mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains.\\nPresently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.\\nThe surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.\\nThe field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.\\nThe opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.\\nFrom the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.\\nI remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.\\nThe sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.\\nTheir icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.\\nMy heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, \"Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.\"\\nAs I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed.\\nHe bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.\\nI was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.\\nI perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created.\\nI trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat.\\nHe approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.\\nBut I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.\\n\"Devil.\"\\nI exclaimed, \"do you dare approach me?\\nAnd do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?\\nBegone, vile insect!\\nOr rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!\\nAnd, oh!\\nThat I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered.\"\\n\"I expected this reception.\"\\nsaid the daemon.\\n\"All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!\\nYet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us.\\nYou purpose to kill me.\\nHow dare you sport thus with life?\\nDo your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.\\nIf you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.\"\\n\"Abhorred monster!\\nFiend that thou art!\\nThe tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes.\\nWretched devil!\\nYou reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed.\"\\nMy rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.\\nHe easily eluded me and said,  \"Be calm!\\nI entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head.\\nHave I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery?\\nLife, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.\\nRemember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple.\\nBut I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee.\\nI am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me.\\nOh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due.\\nRemember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.\\nEverywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded.\\nI was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend.\\nMake me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\"\\n\"Begone!\\nI will not hear you.\\nThere can be no community between you and me; we are enemies.\\nBegone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall.\"\\n\"How can I move thee?\\nWill no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?\\nBelieve me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?\\nYou, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?\\nThey spurn and hate me.\\nThe desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge.\\nI have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge.\\nThese bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings.\\nIf the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction.\\nShall I not then hate them who abhor me?\\nI will keep no terms with my enemies.\\nI am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness.\\nYet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.\\nLet your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me.\\nListen to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.\\nBut hear me.\\nThe guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.\\nListen to me, Frankenstein.\\nYou accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.\\nOh, praise the eternal justice of man!\\nYet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.\"\\n\"Why do you call to my remembrance.\"\\nI rejoined, \"circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author?\\nCursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light!\\nCursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!\\nYou have made me wretched beyond expression.\\nYou have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not.\\nBegone!\\nRelieve me from the sight of your detested form.\"\\n\"Thus I relieve thee, my creator.\"\\nhe said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; \"thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor.\\nStill thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion.\\nBy the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you.\\nHear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain.\\nThe sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide.\\nOn you it rests, whether I quit forever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.\"\\nAs he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.\\nMy heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale.\\nI was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution.\\nI had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.\\nFor the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness.\\nThese motives urged me to comply with his demand.\\nWe crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock.\\nThe air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits.\\nBut I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.\\nA strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.\\nBy degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.\\nDarkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again.\\nI walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.\\nThe light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.\\nThis was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.\\nThis roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.\\nI slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.\\n\"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.\\nBefore I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night.\\nI was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.\\n\"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure.\\nI started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.\\n[The moon]  I gazed with a kind of wonder.\\nIt moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.\\nI was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.\\nNo distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.\\nI felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.\\n\"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other.\\nI gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.\\nI was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes.\\nI began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.\\nSometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.\\nSometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.\\n\"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.\\nMy sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas.\\nMy eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.\\nI found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.\\n\"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it.\\nIn my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.\\nHow strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!\\nI examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood.\\nI quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn.\\nI was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire.\\nThe wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed.\\nI reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire.\\nWhen night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.\\nI covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.\\n\"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.\\nI uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.\\nI observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished.\\nWhen night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.\\nI tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers.\\nI found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\\n\"Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.\\nWhen I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied.\\nIn this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it.\\nI gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun.\\nI passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country.\\nA great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.\\n\"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.\\nThis was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity.\\nFinding the door open, I entered.\\nAn old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.\\nHe turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable.\\nHis appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.\\nBut I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire.\\nI greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd\\'s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.\\nThen, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\\n\"It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant\\'s breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village.\\nHow miraculous did this appear!\\nThe huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns.\\nThe vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite.\\nOne of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\\nThe whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village.\\nThis hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it.\\nMy place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.\\nNo wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\\n\"Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man.\\nAs soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found.\\nIt was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.\\nOne part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me.\\n\"Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.\\nI had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.\\nThe floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.\\n\"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination.\\nIt was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.\\nI ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel.\\nThe girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.\\nYet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned:  she looked patient yet sad.\\nI lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.\\nAs she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.\\nUttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself.\\nShe followed, and they disappeared.\\nPresently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.\\n\"On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood.\\nIn one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\\nThrough this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture.\\nIn one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.\\nThe young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.\\nIt was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before.\\nThe silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love.\\nHe played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet.\\nHe raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.\\n\"Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood.\\nThe girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.\\nShe seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire.\\nShe afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.\\nAfter he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.\\n\"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat.\\nThe meal was quickly dispatched.\\nThe young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\\nNothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.\\nOne was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.\\nThe old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.\\n\"Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.\\nIn the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning.\\nSo soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man\\'s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.\\n\"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.\"\\nI thought of the occurrences of the day.\\nWhat chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.\\nI remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.\\n\"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.\\nThe young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.\\n\"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\\nThe young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within.\\nThe old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation.\\nNothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.\\nThey performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.\\n\"They were not entirely happy.\\nThe young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.\\nI saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it.\\nIf such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched.\\nYet why were these gentle beings unhappy?\\nThey possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another\\'s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness.\\nWhat did their tears imply?\\nDid they really express pain?\\nI was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.\\n\"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family:  it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.\\nTheir nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it.\\nThey often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.\\n\"This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.\\nI had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\\n\"I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours.\\nI found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.\\n\"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside.\\nShe uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.\\nI observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.\\n\"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.\\nI found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds.\\nI perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers.\\nThis was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.\\nBut I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.\\nTheir pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.\\nBy great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, \\'fire,\\' \\'milk,\\' \\'bread,\\' and \\'wood.\\'\\nI learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.\\nThe youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was \\'father.\\' The girl was called \\'sister\\' or \\'Agatha,\\' and the youth \\'Felix,\\' \\'brother,\\' or \\'son.\\'\\nI cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them.\\nI distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as \\'good,\\' \\'dearest,\\' \\'unhappy.\\'\\n\"I spent the winter in this manner.\\nThe gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys.\\nI saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends.\\nThe old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy.\\nHe would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me.\\nAgatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father.\\nIt was not thus with Felix.\\nHe was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends.\\nBut if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.\\n\"I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.\\nIn the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.\\nEarly in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand.\\nIn the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him.\\nAt other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.\\n\"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked.\\nI conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs?\\nI improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\\n\"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers--their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool!\\nAt first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.\\nAlas!\\nI did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.\\n\"As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.\\nFrom this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared.\\nTheir food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.\\nSeveral new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.\\n\"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.\\nThis frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.\\n\"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.\\nDuring the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends.\\nWhen they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage.\\nWhen I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix.\\nI afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words \\'good spirit,\\' \\'wonderful\\'; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.\\n\"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.\\nI thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people.\\nWhen I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me.\\nI looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny.\\nI formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me.\\nI imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.\\n\"These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language.\\nMy organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\\nIt was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.\\n\"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth.\\nMen who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation.\\nThe birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees.\\nHappy, happy earth!\\nFit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome.\\nMy spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.\"\\nI shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.\\n\"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless.\\nIt surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.\\nMy senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.\\n\"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour--the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him--that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son\\'s sorrow.\\nFelix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.\\n\"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.\\nThe lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil.\\nAgatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.\\nHer voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends.\\nOn hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.\\nHer hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.\\n\"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger.\\nShe appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.\\nShe did not appear to understand him, but smiled.\\nHe assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.\\nSome conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man\\'s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.\\n\"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers.\\nThey made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.\\nFelix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian.\\nAgatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came.\\nSome hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.\\nPresently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end.\\nThe stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.\\n\"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.\\nWhen they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, \\'Good night sweet Safie.\\'\\nHe sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation.\\nI ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.\\n\"The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes.\\nShe sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.\\n\"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it.\\nShe played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.\\nThe old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.\\n\"The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\\nSafie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.\\n\"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.\\n\"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.\\n\"While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.\\n\"The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney\\'s Ruins of Empires.\\nI should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.\\nHe had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors.\\nThrough this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth.\\nI heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans--of their subsequent degenerating--of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.\\nI heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.\\n\"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.\\nWas man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?\\nHe appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike.\\nTo be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.\\nFor a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.\\n\"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.\\nWhile I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.\\nI heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.\\n\"The words induced me to turn towards myself.\\nI learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches.\\nA man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!\\nAnd what was I?\\nOf my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.\\nI was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man.\\nI was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.\\nWhen I looked around I saw and heard of none like me.\\nWas I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?\\n\"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge.\\nOh, that I had forever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!\\n\"Of what a strange nature is knowledge!\\nIt clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.\\nI wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death--a state which I feared yet did not understand.\\nI admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows.\\nThe gentle words of Agatha and  the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.\\nThe mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me.\\nMiserable, unhappy wretch!\\n\"Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.\\nI heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.\\n\"But where were my friends and relations?\\nNo father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing.\\nFrom my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion.\\nI had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.\\nWhat was I?\\nThe question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.\\n\"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).\"\\nIt was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.\\n\"The name of the old man was De Lacey.\\nHe was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.\\nHis son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction.\\nA few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.\\n\"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.\\nHe was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.\\nHe was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him.\\nHe was tried and condemned to death.\\nThe injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.\\n\"Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court.\\nHe made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means.\\nAfter many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.\\nFelix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.\\nThe Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth.\\nFelix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.\\n\"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.\\nFelix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness.\\n\"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French.\\nShe thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.\\n\"I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.\\nBefore I depart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.\\n\"Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her.\\nThe young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced.\\nShe instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.\\nThis lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue.\\nThe prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.\\n\"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris.\\nFelix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself.\\nHe had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.\\n\"Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.\\n\"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection.\\nThey conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.\\n\"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans.\\nHe loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited.\\nHe revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.\\nHis plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.\\n\"The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.\\nThe plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison.\\nThe news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure.\\nHis blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved.\\nThis idea was torture to him.\\nHe quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.\\n\"He did not succeed.\\nThey remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.\\n\"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them.\\nFelix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.\\n\"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.\\nHe could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.\\nThe arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.\\n\"When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country.\\nThe generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.\\n\"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter\\'s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.\\nHe intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.\\n\"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency.\\nA residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it.\\nBy some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided.\\nShe hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination.\\nTaking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.\\n\"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.\\nSafie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.\\nShe fell, however, into good hands.\\nThe Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.\"\\nIt impressed me deeply.\\nI learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\\n\"As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed.\\nBut in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.\\n\"One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books.\\nI eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.\\nFortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of Plutarch\\'s Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter.\\nThe possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.\\n\"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.\\nThey produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.\\nIn the Sorrows of Werter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment.\\nThe gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were forever alive in my own bosom.\\nBut I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep.\\nThe disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill  me with wonder.\\nI did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.\\n\"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition.\\nI found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener.\\nI sympathized with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\\n\\'The path of my departure was free,\\' and there was none to lament my annihilation.\\nMy person was hideous and my stature gigantic.\\nWhat did this mean?\\nWho was I?\\nWhat was I?\\nWhence did I come?\\nWhat was my destination?\\nThese questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.\\n\"The volume of Plutarch\\'s Lives which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics.\\nThis book had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter.\\nI learned from Werter\\'s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.\\nMany things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.\\nI had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas.\\nBut I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men.\\nThe cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action.\\nI read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species.\\nI felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.\\nInduced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.\\nThe patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.\\n\"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions.\\nI read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history.\\nIt moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting.\\nI often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own.\\nLike Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect.\\nHe had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\\nMany times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.\\n\"Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.\\nSoon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory.\\nAt first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.\\nIt was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.\\nYou minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences.\\nYou doubtless recollect these papers.\\nHere they are.\\nEverything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible.\\nI sickened as I read.\\n\\'Hateful day when I received life!\\' I exclaimed in agony.\\n\\'Accursed creator!\\nWhy did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?\\nGod, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance.\\nSatan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.\\'\\n\"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they  would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.\\nCould they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship?\\nI resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.\\nI postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\\nBesides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day\\'s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.\\n\"Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.\\nThe presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.\\nFelix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants.\\nThey did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous.\\nIncrease of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.\\nI cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.\\n\"I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation.\\nBut it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.\\nI remembered Adam\\'s supplication to his Creator.\\nBut where was mine?\\nHe had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.\\n\"Autumn passed thus.\\nI saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.\\nYet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat.\\nBut my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers.\\nTheir happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer.\\nThey loved and sympathized with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them.\\nThe more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition.\\nI dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror.\\nThe poor that stopped at their door were never driven away.\\nI asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest:  I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.\\n\"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life.\\nMy attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors.\\nI revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.\\nI had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me.\\nMy voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors.\\n\"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage.\\nWhen his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.\\nAt first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.\\n\"My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realize my fears.\\nThe servants were gone to a neighbouring fair.\\nAll was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground.\\nAgain I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.\\nThe fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage.\\n\"I knocked.\\n\\'Who is there?\\' said the old man.\\n\\'Come in.\\'\\n\"I entered.\\n\\'Pardon this intrusion,\\' said I; \\'I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.\\'\\n\"\\'Enter,\\' said De Lacey, \\'and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.\\'\\n\"\\'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.\\'\\n\"I sat down, and a silence ensued.\\nI knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me.\\n\\'By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?\\'\\n\"\\'No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only.\\nI am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.\\'\\n\"\\'Are they Germans?\\'\\n\"\\'No, they are French.\\nBut let us change the subject.\\nI am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth.\\nThese amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me.\\nI am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world forever.\\'\\n\"\\'Do not despair.\\nTo be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity.\\nRely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.\\'\\n\"\\'They are kind--they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.\\nI have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.\\'\\n\"\\'That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?\\'\\n\"\\'I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors.\\nI tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.\\'\\n\"\\'Where do these friends reside?\\'\\n\"\\'Near this spot.\\'\\n\"The old man paused and then continued, \\'If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them.\\nI am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere.\\nI am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.\\'\\n\"\\'Excellent man!\\nI thank you and accept your generous offer.\\nYou raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.\\'\\n\"\\'Heaven forbid!\\nEven if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.\\nI also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.\\'\\n\"\\'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?\\nFrom your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.\\'\\n\"\\'May I know the names and residence of those friends?\\'\\n\"I paused.\\nThis, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever.\\nI struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.\\nAt that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.\\nI had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, \\'Now is the time!\\nSave and protect me!\\nYou and your family are the friends whom I seek.\\nDo not you desert me in the hour of trial!\\'\\n\"\\'Great God!\\' exclaimed the old man.\\n\\'Who are you?\\'\\n\"At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered.\\nWho can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?\\nAgatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage.\\nFelix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick.\\nI could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope.\\nBut my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained.\\nI saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.\"\\nWhy did I live?\\nWhy, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?\\nI know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge.\\nI could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.\\n\"When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings.\\nI was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness.\\nOh!\\nWhat a miserable night I passed!\\nThe cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness.\\nAll, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathized with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.\\n\"But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair.\\nThere was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies?\\nNo; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.\\n\"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day.\\nAccordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.\\n\"The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions.\\nI had certainly acted imprudently.\\nIt was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and  I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.\\nI ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been  prepared for my approach.\\nBut I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party.\\n\"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.\\nThe horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father\\'s feet.\\nI awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.\\n\"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage.\\nAll there was at peace.\\nI crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose.\\nThat hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.\\nI trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.\\nThe inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense.\\n\"Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors.\\nSoon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.\\n\"\\'Do you consider,\\' said his companion to him, \\'that you will be obliged to pay three months\\' rent and to lose the produce of your garden?\\nI do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination.\\'\\n\"\\'It is utterly useless,\\' replied Felix; \\'we can never again inhabit your cottage.\\nThe life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related.\\nMy wife and my sister will never recover from their horror.\\nI entreat you not to reason with me any more.\\nTake possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.\\'\\n\"Felix trembled violently as he said this.\\nHe and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed.\\nI never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\\n\"I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair.\\nMy protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world.\\nFor the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death.\\nWhen I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me.\\nBut again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.\\nAs night advanced I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.\\n\"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.\\nI lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched.\\nA part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected.\\nThe wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\\n\"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.\\n\"And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?\\nI resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible.\\nAt length the thought of you crossed my mind.\\nI learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life?\\nAmong the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\\nYou had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed.\\n\"But how was I to direct myself?\\nI knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide.\\nI did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair.\\nFrom you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.\\nUnfeeling, heartless creator!\\nYou had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\\nBut on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.\\n\"My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.\\nIt was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\\nI travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being.\\nNature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.\\nOh, earth!\\nHow often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!\\nThe mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness.\\nThe nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.\\nSnow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.\\nA few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path.\\nThe agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\\n\"I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man.\\nOne morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air.\\nI felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me.\\nHalf surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.\\nSoft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\\n\"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\\nHere I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress.\\nI was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport.\\nShe continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream.\\nI rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.\\nShe was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.\\nOn seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.\\nI followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired.\\nI sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\\n\"This was then the reward of my benevolence!\\nI had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.\\nThe feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.\\nInflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.\\nBut the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\\n\"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received.\\nThe ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it.\\nMy sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction.\\nMy daily vows rose for revenge--a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.\\n\"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.\\nThe labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.\\n\"But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva.\\n\"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you.\\nI was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\\n\"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy.\\nSuddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity.\\nIf, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.\\n\"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me.\\nAs soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, \\'Child, what is the meaning of this?\\nI do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.\\'\\n\"He struggled violently.\\n\\'Let me go,\\' he cried; \\'monster!\\nUgly wretch!\\nYou wish to eat me and tear me to pieces.\\nYou are an ogre.\\nLet me go, or I will tell my papa.\\'\\n\"\\'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.\\'\\n\"\\'Hideous monster!\\nLet me go.\\nMy papa is a syndic--he is M.\\nFrankenstein--he will punish you.\\nYou dare not keep me.\\'\\n\"\\'Frankenstein!\\nyou belong then to my enemy--to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.\\'\\n\"The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.\\n\"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, \\'I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.\\'\\n\"As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast.\\nI took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.\\nIn spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me.\\nFor a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.\\n\"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?\\nI only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them.\\n\"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.\\nA woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health.\\nHere, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.\\nAnd then I bent over her and whispered, \\'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near--he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!\\'\\n\"The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.\\nShould she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?\\nThus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\\nThe thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me--not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am forever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.\\nThe crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment!\\nThanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief.\\nI bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.\\nShe moved again, and I fled.\\n\"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever.\\nAt length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify.\\nWe may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition.\\nI am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me.\\nMy companion must be of the same species and have the same defects.\\nThis being you must create.\"\\nBut I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition.\\nHe continued,  \"You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.\\nThis you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.\"\\nThe latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.\\n\"I do refuse it.\"\\nI replied; \"and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me.\\nYou may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes.\\nShall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.\\nBegone!\\nI have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.\"\\n\"You are in the wrong.\"\\nreplied the fiend; \"and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you.\\nI am malicious because I am miserable.\\nAm I not shunned and hated by all mankind?\\nYou, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me?\\nYou would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.\\nShall I respect man when he condemns me?\\nLet him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.\\nBut that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union.\\nYet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery.\\nI will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred.\\nHave a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.\"\\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded--  \"I intended to reason.\\nThis passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess.\\nIf any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature\\'s sake I would make peace with the whole kind!\\nBut I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized.\\nWhat I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me.\\nIt is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.\\nOur lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel.\\nOh!\\nMy creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!\\nLet me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request.\"\\nI was moved.\\nI shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\\nHis tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?\\nHe saw my change of feeling and continued,  \"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.\\nMy food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.\\nMy companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.\\nWe shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food.\\nThe picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty.\\nPitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.\"\\n\"You propose.\"\\nreplied I, \"to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions.\\nHow can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?\\nYou will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.\\nThis may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.\"\\n\"How inconstant are your feelings!\\nBut a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?\\nI swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places.\\nMy evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy!\\nMy life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.\"\\nHis words had a strange effect upon me.\\nI compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.\\nI tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathize with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.\\n\"You swear.\"\\nI said, \"to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?\\nMay not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?\"\\n\"How is this?\\nI must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.\\nIf I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.\\nMy vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.\\nI shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.\"\\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed.\\nI thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him.\\nHis power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with.\\nAfter a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.\\nTurning to him, therefore, I said,  \"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.\"\\n\"I swear.\"\\nhe cried, \"by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again.\\nDepart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.\"\\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments.\\nI saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice.\\nHis tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed.\\nI knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow.\\nThe labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced.\\nNight was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.\\nThe stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me.\\nI wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, \"Oh!\\nStars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.\"\\nThese were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.\\nMorning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva.\\nEven in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations--they weighed on me with a mountain\\'s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.\\nThus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family.\\nMy haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak.\\nI felt as if I were placed under a ban--as if I had no right to claim their sympathies--as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them.\\nYet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task.\\nThe prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.\\nI feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me.\\nI found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition.\\nI had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father\\'s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me.\\nA change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.\\nMy father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine.\\nAt these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude.\\nI passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.\\nBut the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.\\nIt was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me,  \"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.\\nAnd yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society.\\nFor some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.\\nReserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.\"\\nI trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued--\"I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years.\\nYou were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another.\\nBut so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it.\\nYou, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife.\\nNay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.\"\\n\"My dear father, reassure yourself.\\nI love my cousin tenderly and sincerely.\\nI never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection.\\nMy future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.\"\\n\"The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.\\nIf you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us.\\nBut it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.\\nTell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage.\\nWe have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities.\\nYou are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed.\\nDo not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness.\\nInterpret my words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.\"\\nI listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply.\\nI revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.\\nAlas!\\nTo me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay.\\nI was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family!\\nCould I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground?\\nI must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace.\\nI remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking.\\nThe latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father\\'s house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved.\\nI knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror.\\nI was aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation.\\nI must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed.\\nOnce commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness.\\nMy promise fulfilled, the monster would depart forever.\\nOr (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever.\\nThese feelings dictated my answer to my father.\\nI expressed a wish to visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply.\\nAfter so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself.\\nThe duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated.\\nOne paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.\\nWithout previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasbourg.\\nThis interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection.\\nNay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe.\\nIf I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?\\nTo England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.\\nMy father\\'s age rendered him extremely averse to delay.\\nFor myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils--one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her.\\nI now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation.\\nDuring my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure.\\nBut he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England?\\nThis imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\\nI was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen.\\nBut through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.\\nIt was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country.\\nMy journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.\\nIt had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval--and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman\\'s sedulous attention.\\nShe longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell.\\nI threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\\nI remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me.\\nFilled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.\\nI could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.\\nAfter some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasbourg, where I waited two days for Clerval.\\nHe came.\\nAlas, how great was the contrast between us!\\nHe was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day.\\nHe pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky.\\n\"This is what it is to live.\"\\nhe cried; \"how I enjoy existence!\\nBut you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful.\"\\nIn truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine.\\nAnd you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.\\nI, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.\\nWe had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.\\nDuring this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.\\nWe stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasbourg, arrived at Mainz.\\nThe course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque.\\nThe river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.\\nWe saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible.\\nThis part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape.\\nIn one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene.\\nWe travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream.\\nEven I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.\\nI lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger.\\nAnd if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?\\nHe felt as if he had been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.\\n\"I have seen.\"\\nhe said, \"the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that believe the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.\\nThe mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\\nLook at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain.\\nOh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.\"\\nClerval!\\nBeloved friend!\\nEven now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving.\\nHe was a being formed in the \"very poetry of nature.\"\\nHis wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.\\nHis soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination.\\nBut even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind.\\nThe scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:--        ----The sounding cataract      Haunted him like a passion:  the tall rock,      The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,      Their colours and their forms, were then to him      An appetite; a feeling, and a love,      That had no need of a remoter charm,      By thought supplied, or any interest      Unborrow\\'d from the eye.\\n[Wordsworth\\'s \"Tintern Abbey\".]   And where does he now exist?\\nIs this gentle and lovely being lost forever?\\nHas this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;--has this mind perished?\\nDoes it now only exist in my memory?\\nNo, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.\\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.\\nI will proceed with my tale.\\nBeyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us.\\nOur journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.\\nIt was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain.\\nThe banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story.\\nWe saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich--places which I had heard of even in my country.\\nAt length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St.\\nPaul\\'s towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.\\nClerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.\\nIf this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.\\nBut a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound.\\nCompany was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace.\\nBut busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart.\\nI saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.\\nBut in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction.\\nThe difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement.\\nHe was also pursuing an object he had long had in view.\\nHis design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade.\\nIn Britain only could he further the execution of his plan.\\nHe was forever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.\\nI tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection.\\nI often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.\\nI now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head.\\nEvery thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.\\nAfter passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.\\nHe mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided.\\nClerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.\\nWe had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February.\\nWe accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month.\\nIn this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July.\\nI packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.\\nThis was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us.\\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford.\\nAs we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before.\\nIt was here that Charles I.\\nhad collected his forces.\\nThis city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty.\\nThe memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited.\\nThe spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.\\nIf these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\\nThe colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.\\nI enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.\\nI was formed for peaceful happiness.\\nDuring my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits.\\nBut I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be--a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\\nWe passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history.\\nOur little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves.\\nWe visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell.\\nFor a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers.\\nFor an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.\\nWe left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest.\\nThe country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country.\\nWe visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.\\nThe latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\\nFrom Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland.\\nI could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains.\\nThe little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.\\nHere also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness.\\nThe delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.\\n\"I could pass my life here.\"\\nsaid he to me; \"and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.\"\\nBut he found that a traveller\\'s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments.\\nHis feelings are forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\\nWe had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on.\\nFor my own part I was not sorry.\\nI had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the daemon\\'s disappointment.\\nHe might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.\\nThis idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.\\nI waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate.\\nSometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\\nWhen these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.\\nI felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me.\\nI was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\\nI visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being.\\nClerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\\nBut the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur\\'s Seat, St.\\nBernard\\'s Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration.\\nBut I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\\nWe left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St.\\nAndrew\\'s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\\nBut I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone.\\n\"Do you.\"\\nsaid I, \"enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous.\\nI may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.\"\\nHenry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate.\\nHe entreated me to write often.\\n\"I had rather be with you.\"\\nhe said, \"in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear  friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.\"\\nHaving parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude.\\nI did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion.\\nWith this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.\\nIt was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves.\\nThe soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.\\nVegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.\\nOn the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived.\\nThis I hired.\\nIt contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury.\\nThe thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges.\\nI ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty.\\nAs it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.\\nIn this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.\\nIt was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene.\\nI thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape.\\nIts hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains.\\nIts fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.\\nIn this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me.\\nSometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work.\\nIt was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged.\\nDuring my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings.\\nBut now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.\\nThus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous.\\nEvery moment I feared to meet my persecutor.\\nSometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold.\\nI feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.\\nIn the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.\\nI looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.\\nAs I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.\\nThree years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it forever with the bitterest remorse.\\nI was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness.\\nHe had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation.\\nThey might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?\\nShe also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.\\nEven if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror.\\nHad I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?\\nI had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.\\nI trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the daemon at the casement.\\nA ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.\\nYes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.\\nAs I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery.\\nI thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.\\nThe wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.\\nI left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment.\\nI was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.\\nSeveral hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon.\\nA few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another.\\nI felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.\\nIn a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly.\\nI trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.\\nPresently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.\\nShutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, \"You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?\\nDo you dare to break your promise?\\nI have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.\\nI have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland.\\nI have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?\"\\n\"Begone!\\nI do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.\"\\n\"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension.\\nRemember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you.\\nYou are my creator, but I am your master; obey.\"\\n\"The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived.\\nYour threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice.\\nShall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?\\nBegone!\\nI am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.\"\\nThe monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger.\\n\"Shall each man.\"\\ncried he, \"find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?\\nI had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\\nMan!\\nYou may hate, but beware!\\nYour hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt  will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever.\\nAre you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?\\nYou can blast my other passions, but revenge remains--revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food!\\nI may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery.\\nBeware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.\\nI will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.\\nMan, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.\"\\n\"Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.\\nI have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words.\\nLeave me; I am inexorable.\"\\n\"It is well.\\nI go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.\"\\nI started forward and exclaimed, \"Villain!\\nBefore you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.\"\\nI would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation.\\nIn a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.\\nAll was again silent, but his words rang in my ears.\\nI burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean.\\nI walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.\\nWhy had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?\\nBut I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland.\\nI shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\\nAnd then I thought again of his words--\"I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT.\"\\nThat, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny.\\nIn that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice.\\nThe prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle.\\nThe night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair.\\nI left the house, the horrid scene of the last night\\'s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.\\nI desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.\\nIf I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a daemon whom I had myself created.\\nI walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation.\\nWhen it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep.\\nI had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.\\nThe sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\\nThe sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him.\\nHe said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise.\\nHe could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare.\\nHe besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together.\\nThis letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\\nYet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me.\\nThe next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory.\\nThe remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.\\nI paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber.\\nWith trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.\\nNothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the daemon.\\nI had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly.\\nThe idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.\\nI had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.\\nBetween two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\\nThe scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them.\\nI felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures.\\nAt one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.\\nThe sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising.\\nBut it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.\\nClouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.\\nI do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably.\\nThe wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.\\nI found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked.\\nI endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.\\nThus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.\\nI confess that I felt a few sensations of terror.\\nI had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.\\nI might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.\\nI had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings.\\nI looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave.\\n\"Fiend.\"\\nI exclaimed, \"your task is already fulfilled.\"\\nI thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval--all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.\\nThis idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me forever, I shudder to reflect on it.\\nSome hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers.\\nBut these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.\\nAlmost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\\nHow mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery!\\nI constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.\\nIt had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation.\\nI saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man.\\nI carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.\\nAs I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment.\\nFortunately I had money with me.\\nAs I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.\\nAs I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot.\\nThey seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm.\\nAs it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.\\n\"My good friends.\"\\nsaid I, \"will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?\"\\n\"You will know that soon enough.\"\\nreplied a man with a hoarse voice.\\n\"Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.\"\\nI was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.\\n\"Why do you answer me so roughly?\"\\nI replied.\\n\"Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.\"\\n\"I do not know.\"\\nsaid the man, \"what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.\"\\nWhile this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.\\nTheir faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed  and in some degree alarmed me.\\nI inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied.\\nI then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr.\\nKirwin\\'s to give an account of yourself.\"\\n\"Who is Mr.\\nKirwin?\\nWhy am I to give an account of myself?\\nIs not this a free country?\"\\n\"Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.\\nMr.\\nKirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.\"\\nThis answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.\\nI was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town.\\nI was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.\\nLittle did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.\\nI must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.\\nHe looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\\nAbout half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o\\'clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port.\\nIt was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below.\\nHe walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance.\\nAs he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground.\\nHis companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.\\nTheir first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold.\\nThey instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life.\\nIt appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age.\\nHe had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\\nThe first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support.\\nThe magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.\\nThe son confirmed his father\\'s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed.\\nA woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.\\nAnother woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.\\nThey put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.\\nSeveral other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\\nBesides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of ---- from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\\nMr.\\nKirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me.\\nThis idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described.\\nI was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn.\\nI could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\\nI entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.\\nHow can I describe my sensations on beholding it?\\nI feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony.\\nThe examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me.\\nI gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, \"Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life?\\nTwo I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor-.\"\\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\\nA fever succeeded to this.\\nI lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval.\\nSometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.\\nFortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr.\\nKirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\\nWhy did I not die?\\nMore miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?\\nDeath snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!\\nOf what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?\\nBut I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\\nIt was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\\nThis sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me.\\nShe was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize that class.\\nThe lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery.\\nHer tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\\n\"Are you better now, sir?\"\\nsaid she.\\nI replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, \"I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.\"\\n\"For that matter.\"\\nreplied the old woman, \"if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!\\nHowever, that\\'s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.\"\\nI turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.\\nThe whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.\\nAs the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.\\nThe physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second.\\nWho could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?\\nThese were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr.\\nKirwin had shown me extreme kindness.\\nHe had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse.\\nIt is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer.\\nHe came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals.\\nOne day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death.\\nI was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.\\nAt one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.\\nSuch were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr.\\nKirwin entered.\\nHis countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French, \"I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?\"\\n\"I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.\"\\n\"I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.\\nBut you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.\"\\n\"That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals.\\nPersecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?\"\\n\"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred.\\nYou were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder.\\nThe first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.\"\\nAs Mr.\\nKirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.\\nI suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr.\\nKirwin hastened to say, \"Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness.\\nI found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father.\\nI instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\\nBut you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind.\"\\n\"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?\"\\n\"Your family is perfectly well.\"\\nsaid Mr.\\nKirwin with gentleness; \"and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.\"\\nI know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires.\\nI put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony, \"Oh!\\nTake him away!\\nI cannot see him; for God\\'s sake, do not let him enter.\"\\nMr.\\nKirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.\\nHe could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone, \"I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.\"\\n\"My father.\"\\ncried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure.\\n\"Is my father indeed come?\\nHow kind, how very kind!\\nBut where is he, why does he not hasten to me?\"\\nMy change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.\\nHe rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\\nNothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father.\\nI stretched out my hand to him and cried, \"Are you, then, safe--and Elizabeth--and Ernest?\"\\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.\\n\"What a place is this that you inhabit, my son.\"\\nsaid he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room.\\n\"You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you.\\nAnd poor Clerval-.\"\\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\\n\"Alas!\\nYes, my father.\"\\nreplied I; \"some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry.\"\\nWe were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity.\\nMr.\\nKirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.\\nBut the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.\\nAs my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate.\\nThe image of Clerval was forever before me, ghastly and murdered.\\nMore than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse.\\nAlas!\\nWhy did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?\\nIt was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close.\\nSoon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest.\\nThen the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\\nThe season of the assizes approached.\\nI had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held.\\nMr.\\nKirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.\\nI was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death.\\nThe grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.\\nMy father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.\\nI did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful.\\nThe cup of life was poisoned forever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.\\nSometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\\nMy father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.\\nHe talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me.\\nSometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair.\\nAt these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\\nYet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair.\\nIt was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which  I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous.\\nMy father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck--the shadow of a human being.\\nMy strength was gone.\\nI was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame.\\nStill, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield.\\nWe took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\\nIt was midnight.\\nI lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves.\\nI hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva.\\nThe past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation.\\nI repassed, in my memory, my whole life--my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt.\\nI remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived.\\nI was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\\nEver since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life.\\nOppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly.\\nBut sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me.\\nTowards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend\\'s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears.\\nMy father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.\\nWe landed, and proceeded to Paris.\\nI soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey.\\nMy father\\'s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.\\nHe wished me to seek amusement in society.\\nI abhorred the face of man.\\nOh, not abhorred!\\nThey were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism.\\nBut I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse.\\nI had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.\\nHow they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!\\nMy father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair.\\nSometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.\\n\"Alas!\\nMy father.\"\\nsaid I, \"how little do you know me.\\nHuman beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride.\\nJustine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this--I murdered her.\\nWilliam, Justine, and Henry--they all died by my hands.\"\\nMy father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence.\\nI avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created.\\nI had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue.\\nBut, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast.\\nI checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.\\nYet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me.\\nI could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.\\nUpon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, \"My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?\\nMy dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.\"\\n\"I am not mad.\"\\nI cried energetically; \"the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.\\nI am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.\\nA thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.\"\\nThe conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.\\nHe wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.\\nAs time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.\\nBy the utmost self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice.\\nA few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:   \"My dear Friend,  \"It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight.\\nMy poor cousin, how much you must have suffered!\\nI expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva.\\nThis winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.\\n\"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.\\nI would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet.\\nExplanation!\\nYou may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?\\nIf you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.\\nBut you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.\\n\"You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy.\\nWe were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place.\\nWe were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older.\\nBut as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case?\\nTell me, dearest Victor.\\nAnswer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth--Do you not love another?\\n\"You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.\\nBut this is false reasoning.\\nI confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion.\\nBut it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.\\nEven now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word \\'honour,\\' all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.\\nI, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.\\nAh!\\nVictor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition.\\nBe happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.\\n\"Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.\\nMy uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.\\n\"Elizabeth Lavenza       \"Geneva, May 18th, 17-.\"\\nThis letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend--\"I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT.\"\\nSuch was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.\\nOn that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death.\\nWell, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end.\\nIf he were vanquished, I should be a free man.\\nAlas!\\nWhat freedom?\\nSuch as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free.\\nSuch would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.\\nSweet and beloved Elizabeth!\\nI read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel\\'s arm bared to drive me from all hope.\\nYet I would die to make her happy.\\nIf the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.\\nMy destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.\\nHe had vowed TO BE WITH ME ON MY WEDDING-NIGHT, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats.\\nI resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father\\'s happiness, my adversary\\'s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour.\\nIn this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.\\nMy letter was calm and affectionate.\\n\"I fear, my beloved girl.\"\\nI said, \"little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you.\\nChase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment.\\nI have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured.\\nI will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.\\nBut until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.\\nThis I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.\"\\nIn about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth\\'s letter we returned to Geneva.\\nThe sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish  cheeks.\\nI saw a change in her also.\\nShe was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.\\nThe tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.\\nMemory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent.\\nI neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.\\nElizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.\\nShe wept with me and for me.\\nWhen reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation.\\nAh!\\nIt is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace.\\nThe agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.\\nSoon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth.\\nI remained silent.\\n\"Have you, then, some other attachment?\"\\n\"None on earth.\\nI love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight.\\nLet the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.\"\\n\"My dear Victor, do not speak thus.\\nHeavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.\\nOur circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.\\nAnd when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.\"\\nSuch were the lessons of my father.\\nBut to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words \"I SHALL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT.\"\\nI should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable.\\nBut death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.\\nGreat God!\\nIf for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.\\nBut, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.\\nAs the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.\\nBut I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.\\nShe looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\\nPreparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance.\\nI shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy.\\nThrough my father\\'s exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.\\nA small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her.\\nIt was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood.\\nIn the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me.\\nI carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.\\nIndeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnization drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.\\nElizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind.\\nBut on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day.\\nMy father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.\\nAfter the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father\\'s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day.\\nThe day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\\nThose were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.\\nWe passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\\nI took the hand of Elizabeth.\\n\"You are sorrowful, my love.\\nAh!\\nIf you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.\"\\n\"Be happy, my dear Victor.\"\\nreplied Elizabeth; \"there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented.\\nSomething whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice.\\nObserve how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting.\\nLook also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom.\\nWhat a divine day!\\nHow happy and serene all nature appears.\"\\nThus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects.\\nBut her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.\\nThe sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills.\\nThe Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.\\nThe spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.\\nThe wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay.\\nThe sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me forever.\\nThe wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west.\\nThe moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise.\\nSuddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.\\nI had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.\\nI was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished.\\nElizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, \"What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?\\nWhat is it you fear?\"\\n\"Oh!\\nPeace, peace, my love.\"\\nreplied I; \"this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.\"\\nI passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.\\nShe left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary.\\nBut I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream.\\nIt came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.\\nAs I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs.\\nThis state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.\\nGreat God!\\nWhy did I not then expire!\\nWhy am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?\\nShe was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.\\nEverywhere I turn I see the same figure--her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier.\\nCould I behold this and live?\\nAlas!\\nLife is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated.\\nFor a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.\\nWhen I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me.\\nI escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.\\nShe had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep.\\nI rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\\nThe murderous mark of the fiend\\'s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.\\nWhile I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\\nThe windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\\nThe shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\\nA grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife.\\nI rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.\\nThe report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.\\nI pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain.\\nAfter passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy.\\nAfter having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.\\nI attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.\\nIn this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost.\\nAfter an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay.\\nThere were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause.\\nI was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.\\nThe death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet.\\nThis idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.\\nI started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\\nThere were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.\\nHowever, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.\\nI hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise.\\nBut the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion.\\nI threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose.\\nIf I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\\nTears streamed from my eyes.\\nThe rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth.\\nNothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.\\nThe sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before.\\nA fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.\\nBut why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event?\\nMine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their acme, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you.\\nKnow that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate.\\nMy own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.\\nI arrived at Geneva.\\nMy father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore.\\nI see him now, excellent and venerable old man!\\nHis eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight--his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.\\nCursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness!\\nHe could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.\\nWhat then became of me?\\nI know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.\\nSometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon.\\nMelancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison.\\nFor they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\\nLiberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.\\nAs the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause--the monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction.\\nI was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.\\nNor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.\\nThe magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.\\n\"Be assured, sir.\"\\nsaid he, \"no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.\"\\n\"I thank you.\"\\nreplied I; \"listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make.\\nIt is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction.\\nThe story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.\"\\nMy manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life.\\nI now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\\nThe magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.\\nWhen I had concluded my narration I said, \"This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power.\\nIt is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.\"\\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor.\\nHe had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned.\\nHe, however, answered mildly, \"I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance.\\nWho can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude?\\nBesides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.\"\\n\"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey.\\nBut I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.\"\\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\\n\"You are mistaken.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes.\\nBut I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.\"\\n\"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.\\nMy revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.\\nMy rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists.\\nYou refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.\"\\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.\\nBut to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness.\\nHe endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\\n\"Man.\"\\nI cried, \"how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!\\nCease; you know not what it is you say.\"\\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.\\nI was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.\\nMy first resolution was to quit Geneva forever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful.\\nI provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.\\nAnd now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life.\\nI have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.\\nHow I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death.\\nBut revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.\\nWhen I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.\\nBut my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue.\\nAs night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed.\\nI entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves.\\nEverything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer.\\nThe spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.\\nThe deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair.\\nThey were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.\\nI knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, \"By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the daemon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.\\nFor this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever.\\nAnd I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work.\\nLet the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.\"\\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.\\nI was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh.\\nIt rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\\nSurely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance.\\nThe laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, \"I am satisfied, miserable wretch!\\nYou have determined to live, and I am satisfied.\"\\nI darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp.\\nSuddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.\\nI pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.\\nGuided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.\\nThe blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.\\nI took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\\nAmidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track.\\nSometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me.\\nThe snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain.\\nTo you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel?\\nCold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.\\nSometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.\\nThe fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me.\\nOften, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.\\nI followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected.\\nIn other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path.\\nI had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\\nMy life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy.\\nO blessed sleep!\\nOften, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.\\nThe spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.\\nDeprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships.\\nDuring the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth\\'s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth.\\nOften, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.\\nWhat agonizing fondness did I feel for them!\\nHow did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived!\\nAt such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the daemon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.\\nWhat his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.\\nSometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury.\\n\"My reign is not yet over\"--these words were legible in one of these inscriptions--\"you live, and my power is complete.\\nFollow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive.\\nYou will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.\\nCome on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.\"\\nScoffing devil!\\nAgain do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death.\\nNever will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!\\nAs I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.\\nThe peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey.\\nThe rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\\nThe triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.\\nOne inscription that he left was in these words:  \"Prepare!\\nYour toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.\"\\nMy courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon.\\nOh!\\nHow unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south!\\nCovered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness.\\nThe Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils.\\nI did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary\\'s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.\\nSome weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.\\nI know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day\\'s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.\\nWith new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore.\\nI inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information.\\nA gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance.\\nHe had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal  frosts.\\nOn hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\\nHe had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.\\nYet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\\nAfter a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\\nI exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.\\nI cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support.\\nImmense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.\\nBut again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.\\nBy the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes.\\nDespair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.\\nOnce, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.\\nI strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within.\\nOh!\\nWith what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\\nWarm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.\\nBut this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour\\'s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route.\\nThe sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.\\nI indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days\\' journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.\\nBut now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before.\\nA ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific.\\nI pressed on, but in vain.\\nThe wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.\\nThe work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death.\\nIn this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.\\nI had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight.\\nI quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship.\\nI had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose.\\nI hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy.\\nBut your direction was northwards.\\nYou took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.\\nOh!\\nWhen will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?\\nIf I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death.\\nAnd do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?\\nNo; I am not so selfish.\\nYet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live--swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.\\nHe is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not.\\nHis soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice.\\nHear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart.\\nI will hover near and direct the steel aright.\\nWalton, in continuation.\\nAugust 26th, 17--   You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?\\nSometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish.\\nHis fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness.\\nSometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\\nHis tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected.\\nSuch a monster has, then, really existence!\\nI cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration.\\nSometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature\\'s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.\\n\"Are you mad, my friend?\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you?\\nWould you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?\\nPeace, peace!\\nLearn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.\"\\nFrankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy.\\n\"Since you have preserved my narration.\"\\nsaid he, \"I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.\"\\nThus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed.\\nMy thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.\\nI wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?\\nOh, no!\\nThe only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death.\\nYet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world.\\nThis faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.\\nOur conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes.\\nOn every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.\\nHis eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears.\\nWhat a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!\\nHe seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.\\n\"When younger.\"\\nsaid he, \"I believed myself destined for some great enterprise.\\nMy feelings are profound, but I possessed a  coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.\\nThis sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures.\\nWhen I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors.\\nBut this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust.\\nAll my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell.\\nMy imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man.\\nEven now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete.\\nI trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects.\\nFrom my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk!\\nOh!\\nMy friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation.\\nDespondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.\"\\nMust I then lose this admirable being?\\nI have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathize with and love me.\\nBehold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him.\\nI would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.\\n\"I thank you, Walton.\"\\nhe said, \"for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?\\nCan any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?\\nEven where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.\\nThey know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.\\nA sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion.\\nBut I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear.\\nThey are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.\\nIf I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.\\nBut such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.\"\\nSeptember 2nd  My beloved Sister,  I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it.\\nI am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel.\\nThe brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have none to bestow.\\nThere is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.\\nYet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me.\\nIf we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.\\nAnd what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind?\\nYou will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.\\nYears will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope.\\nOh!\\nMy beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death.\\nBut you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.\\nHeaven bless you and make you so!\\nMy unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.\\nHe endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued.\\nHe reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.\\nEven the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man.\\nThese feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair.\\nSeptember 5th   A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.\\nWe are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict.\\nThe cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation.\\nFrankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.\\nI mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.\\nThis morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend--his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly--I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin.\\nThey entered, and their leader addressed me.\\nHe told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.\\nWe were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this.\\nThey insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards.\\nThis speech troubled me.\\nI had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free.\\nYet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?\\nI hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.\\nTurning towards the men, he said, \"What do you mean?\\nWhat do you demand of your captain?\\nAre you, then, so easily turned from your design?\\nDid you not call this a glorious expedition?\\n\"And wherefore was it glorious?\\nNot because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome.\\nFor this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking.\\nYou were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind.\\nAnd now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides.\\nWhy, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards.\\nOh!\\nBe men, or be more than men.\\nBe steady to your purposes and firm as a rock.\\nThis ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not.\\nDo not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows.\\nReturn as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.\"\\nHe spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?\\nThey looked at one another and were unable to reply.\\nI spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return.\\nThey retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life.\\nHow all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.\\nYet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships.\\nSeptember 7th   The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.\\nThus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed.\\nIt requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience.\\nSeptember 12th   It is past; I am returning to England.\\nI have lost my hopes of utility and glory; I have lost my friend.\\nBut I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not despond.\\nSeptember 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction.\\nWe were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed.\\nThe ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free.\\nWhen the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued.\\nFrankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult.\\n\"They shout.\"\\nI said, \"because they will soon return to England.\"\\n\"Do you, then, really return?\"\\n\"Alas!\\nYes; I cannot withstand their demands.\\nI cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return.\"\\n\"Do so, if you will; but I will not.\\nYou may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not.\\nI am weak, but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength.\"\\nSaying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.\\nIt was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct.\\nAt length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak.\\nThe surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed.\\nIn the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.\\nHis sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient.\\nI sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, \"Alas!\\nThe strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being.\\nThink not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary.\\nDuring these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\\nIn a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being.\\n\"This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that.\\nMy duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery.\\nUrged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature.\\nHe showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end.\\nMiserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die.\\nThe task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed.\\nWhen actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.\\n\"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him.\\nBut the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death.\\nI dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion.\\n\"That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.\\nThe forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.\\nFarewell, Walton!\\nSeek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries.\\nYet why do I say this?\\nI have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.\"\\nHis voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence.\\nAbout half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed forever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.\\nMargaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?\\nWhat can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?\\nAll that I should express would be inadequate and feeble.\\nMy tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment.\\nBut I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation.\\nI am interrupted.\\nWhat do these sounds portend?\\nIt is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.\\nAgain there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie.\\nI must arise and examine.\\nGood night, my sister.\\nGreat God!\\nwhat a scene has just taken place!\\nI am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it.\\nI hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.\\nI entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.\\nOver him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe--gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions.\\nAs he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy.\\nWhen he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window.\\nNever did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness.\\nI shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\\nI called on him to stay.\\nHe paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.\\n\"That is also my victim.\"\\nhe exclaimed.\\n\"In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close!\\nOh, Frankenstein!\\nGenerous and self-devoted being!\\nWhat does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me?\\nI, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst.\\nAlas!\\nHe is cold, he cannot answer me.\"\\nHis voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion.\\nI approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness.\\nI attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips.\\nThe monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches.\\nAt length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.\\n\"Your repentance.\"\\nI said, \"is now superfluous.\\nIf you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.\"\\n\"And do you dream?\"\\nsaid the daemon.\\n\"Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?\\nHe.\"\\nhe continued, pointing to the corpse, \"he suffered not in the consummation of the deed.\\nOh!\\nNot the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution.\\nA frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.\\nThink you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears?\\nMy heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine.\\n\"After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome.\\nI pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself.\\nBut when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was forever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.\\nI recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.\\nI knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey.\\nYet when she died!\\nNay, then I was not miserable.\\nI had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair.\\nEvil thenceforth became my good.\\nUrged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen.\\nThe completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion.\\nAnd now it is ended; there is my last victim.\"\\nI was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.\\n\"Wretch.\"\\nI said.\\n\"It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made.\\nYou throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.\\nHypocritical fiend!\\nIf he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.\\nIt is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.\"\\n\"Oh, it is not thus--not thus.\"\\ninterrupted the being.\\n\"Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions.\\nYet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\\nNo sympathy may I ever find.\\nWhen I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated.\\nBut now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?\\nI am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.\\nOnce my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment.\\nOnce I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.\\nI was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion.\\nBut now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal.\\nNo guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.\\nWhen I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness.\\nBut it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil.\\nYet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\\n\"You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes.\\nBut in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions.\\nFor while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires.\\nThey were forever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.\\nWas there no injustice in this?\\nAm I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me?\\nWhy do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely?\\nWhy do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child?\\nNay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings!\\nI, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.\\nEven now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\\n\"But it is true that I am a wretch.\\nI have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.\\nI have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin.\\n\"There he lies, white and cold in death.\\nYou hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.\\nI look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\\n\"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.\\nMy work is nearly complete.\\nNeither yours nor any man\\'s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own.\\nDo not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice.\\nI shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been.\\nI shall die.\\nI shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched.\\nHe is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish.\\nI shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.\\n\"Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness.\\nSome years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation.\\nPolluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?\\n\"Farewell!\\nI leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold.\\nFarewell, Frankenstein!\\nIf thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction.\\nBut it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel.\\nBlasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever.\\n\"But soon.\"\\nhe cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, \"I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt.\\nSoon these burning miseries will be extinct.\\nI shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames.\\nThe light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds.\\nMy spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.\\nFarewell.\"\\nHe sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel.\\nHe was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.\\n\\nThe Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse.\\nThroughout their lives they

courts.\\nImprisoned in Florence, 1512; later exiled and returned to San Casciano.\\nDied at Florence on 22nd June 1527.\\nINTRODUCTION  Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469.\\nHe was the second son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute, and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife.\\nBoth parents were members of the old Florentine nobility.\\nHis life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of Florence.\\nHis youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de\\' Medici, Il Magnifico.\\nThe downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year Machiavelli entered the public service.\\nDuring his official career Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his office.\\nThe Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they were once more driven out.\\nThis was the period of Machiavelli\\'s literary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth year, without having regained office.\\nYOUTH -- Aet.\\n1-25--1469-94  Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of this representative citizen may be easily imagined.\\nFlorence has been described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving Lorenzo.\\nSavonarola\\'s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a gibe in \"The Prince.\"\\nwhere he is cited as an example of an unarmed prophet who came to a bad end.\\nWhereas the magnificence of the Medicean rule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli strongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to Lorenzo\\'s grandson that he dedicates \"The Prince.\"\\nMachiavelli, in his \"History of Florence.\"\\ngives us a picture of the young men among whom his youth was passed.\\nHe writes: \"They were freer than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming, and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly was thought the wisest.\"\\nIn a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied.\\nHe writes: \"I have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure, especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your share.\"\\nThen, writing of a new patron, he continues: \"This will turn out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then, you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters and music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I have.\\nTherefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.\"\\nOFFICE -- Aet.\\n25-43--1494-1512  The second period of Machiavelli\\'s life was spent in the service of the free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512.\\nAfter serving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed Chancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and Peace.\\nHere we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of Machiavelli\\'s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the affairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and dispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings.\\nA mere recapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and soldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and supplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters which illustrate \"The Prince.\"\\nHis first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, \"my lady of Forl.\"\\nof \"The Prince.\"\\nfrom whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it is far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on fortresses.\\nThis is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is urged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.\\nIn 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for continuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct of affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft summarized in \"The Prince.\"\\nand was consequently driven out.\\nHe, also, it was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support to Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge that such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the faith of princes.\\nMachiavelli\\'s public life was largely occupied with events arising out of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of \"The Prince.\"\\nMachiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke for the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have seized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the pattern of Cesare Borgia\\'s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed by some critics as the \"her.\"\\nof \"The Prince.\"\\nYet in \"The Princ.\"\\nthe duke is in point of fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the fortune of others, and falls with them; who takes every course that might be expected from a prudent man but the course which will save him; who is prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens; and who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims that it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen fatality.\\nOn the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to watch the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia cheated into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano delle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most reason to fear the duke.\\nMachiavelli, when commenting on this election, says that he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to forget old injuries deceives himself.\\nJulius did not rest until he had ruined Cesare.\\nIt was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that pontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought to a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing chiefly to his impetuous character.\\nIt is in reference to Pope Julius that Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and women, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man that will win and hold them both.\\nIt is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian states, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany, with results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those events, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they impinge on the personality of Machiavelli.\\nHe had several meetings with Louis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch\\'s character has already been alluded to.\\nMachiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as the man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but who in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who, had he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have been ruined.\\nThe Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men of the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but Machiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the secret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without force of character--ignoring the human agencies necessary to carry his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of his wishes.\\nThe remaining years of Machiavelli\\'s official career were filled with events arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the three great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the object of crushing the Venetian Republic.\\nThis result was attained in the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won in eight hundred years.\\nFlorence had a difficult part to play during these events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out between the pope and the French, because friendship with France had dictated the entire policy of the Republic.\\nWhen, in 1511, Julius II finally formed the Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy of the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the Medici should be restored.\\nThe return of the Medici to Florence on 1st September 1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal for the dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end to his public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining office.\\nLITERATURE AND DEATH -- Aet.\\n43-58--1512-27  On the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, was dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512.\\nShortly after this he was accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici, imprisoned, and put to the question by torture.\\nThe new Medicean pope, Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at San Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature.\\nIn a letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left a very interesting description of his life at this period, which elucidates his methods and his motives in writing \"The Prince.\"\\nAfter describing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he writes: \"The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt, and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay, death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.\\nAnd because Dante says:       Knowledge doth come of learning well retained,      Unfruitful else,  I have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have composed a small work on \\'Principalities,\\' where I pour myself out as fully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a principality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how they can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever pleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince, especially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it to his Magnificence Giuliano.\\nFilippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will be able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had with him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.\"\\nThe \"little boo.\"\\nsuffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form in which it has reached us.\\nVarious mental influences were at work during its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some unknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de\\' Medici.\\nAlthough Machiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or presented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo ever received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any employment.\\nAlthough it was plagiarized during Machiavelli\\'s lifetime, \"The Princ.\"\\nwas never published by him, and its text is still disputable.\\nMachiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: \"And as to this little thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that during the fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have neither slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by one who has reaped experience at the expense of others.\\nAnd of my loyalty none could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not now learn how to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as I have, cannot change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my honesty.\"\\nBefore Machiavelli had got \"The Princ.\"\\noff his hands he commenced his \"Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius.\"\\nwhich should be read concurrently with \"The Prince.\"\\nThese and several minor works occupied him until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look after the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa.\\nIn 1519 the Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her citizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new constitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on one pretext or another it was not promulgated.\\nIn 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli to settle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly remarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he was much sought after, and also for the production of his \"Art of War.\"\\nIt was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance of Cardinal de\\' Medici to write the \"History of Florence.\"\\na task which occupied him until 1525.\\nHis return to popular favour may have determined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer observes that \"an able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will endeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play with.\"\\nWhen the \"History of Florenc.\"\\nwas finished, Machiavelli took it to Rome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de\\' Medici, who had in the meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII.\\nIt is somewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written \"The Princ.\"\\nfor the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained power in Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the \"History of Florenc.\"\\nto the head of the family when its ruin was now at hand.\\nIn that year the battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left Francis I a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V.\\nThis was followed by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular party at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more banished.\\nMachiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his return, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the \"Ten of Liberty and Peace.\"\\nUnhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached Florence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.\\nTHE MAN AND HIS WORKS  No one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence has decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her most famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have found in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the germs of her renaissance among the nations of Europe.\\nWhilst it is idle to protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name, it may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which this sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that the researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more reasonably.\\nIt is due to these inquiries that the shape of an \"unholy necromancer.\"\\nwhich so long haunted men\\'s vision, has begun to fade.\\nMachiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced retirement from affairs.\\nHe does not present himself, nor is he depicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination, the successful statesman and author, for he appears to have been only moderately prosperous in his several embassies and political employments.\\nHe was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII, overawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren of results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery that he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice.\\nIn the conduct of his own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear by the side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of compromising himself; his connection with the Medici was open to suspicion, and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when he set him to write the \"History of Florence.\"\\nrather than employ him in the state.\\nAnd it is on the literary side of his character, and there alone, that we find no weakness and no failure.\\nAlthough the light of almost four centuries has been focused on \"The Prince.\"\\nits problems are still debatable and interesting, because they are the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers.\\nSuch as they are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli\\'s contemporaries; yet they cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of Europe rely on material rather than on moral forces.\\nIts historical incidents and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which Machiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and conduct.\\nLeaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish some European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, \"The Princ.\"\\nis bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn.\\nMen are still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the days of Alexander VI.\\nThe cloak of religion still conceals the vices which Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon.\\nMen will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them to be--and are ruined.\\nIn politics there are no perfectly safe courses; prudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones.\\nThen--to pass to a higher plane--Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win an empire, they do not win glory.\\nNecessary wars are just wars, and the arms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to fight.\\nIt is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli\\'s that government should be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the people with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of society; to this \"high argumen.\"\\n\"The Princ.\"\\ncontributes but little.\\nMachiavelli always refused to write either of men or of governments otherwise than as he found them, and he writes with such skill and insight that his work is of abiding value.\\nBut what invests \"The Princ.\"\\nwith more than a merely artistic or historical interest is the incontrovertible truth that it deals with the great principles which still guide nations and rulers in their relationship with each other and their neighbours.\\nIn translating \"The Princ.\"\\nmy aim has been to achieve at all costs an exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression.\\nMachiavelli was no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he wrote obliged him to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his substance grave, his manner nobly plain and serious.\\n\"Quis eo fuit unquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?\"\\nIn \"The Prince.\"\\nit may be truly said, there is reason assignable, not only for every word, but for the position of every word.\\nTo an Englishman of Shakespeare\\'s time the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easy task, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day it is not so simple.\\nTo take a single example: the word \"intrattenere.\"\\nemployed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would by an Elizabethan be correctly rendered \"entertain.\"\\nand every contemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that \"Rome entertained the Aetolians and the Achaeans without augmenting their power.\"\\nBut to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that \"Rome maintained friendly relations with the Aetolians.\"\\netc., using four words to do the work of one.\\nI have tried to preserve the pithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to the sense.\\nIf the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author\\'s meaning, may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.\\nThe following is a

Lorenzo Di Piero De\\' Medici:       Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are      accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most      precious, or in which they see him take most delight; whence one      often sees horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and      similar ornaments presented to princes, worthy of their greatness.\\nDesiring therefore to present myself to your Magnificence with      some testimony of my devotion towards you, I have not found among      my possessions anything which I hold more dear than, or value so      much as, the knowledge of the actions of great men, acquired by      long experience in contemporary affairs, and a continual study of      antiquity; which, having reflected upon it with great and      prolonged diligence, I now send, digested into a little volume, to      your Magnificence.\\nAnd although I may consider this work unworthy of your      countenance, nevertheless I trust much to your benignity that it      may be acceptable, seeing that it is not possible for me to make a      better gift than to offer you the opportunity of understanding in      the shortest time all that I have learnt in so many years, and      with so many troubles and dangers; which work I have not      embellished with swelling or magnificent words, nor stuffed with      rounded periods, nor with any extrinsic allurements or adornments      whatever, with which so many are accustomed to embellish their      works; for I have wished either that no honour should be given it,      or else that the truth of the matter and the weightiness of the      theme shall make it acceptable.\\nNor do I hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a man      of low and humble condition dare to discuss and settle the      concerns of princes; because, just as those who draw landscapes      place themselves below in the plain to contemplate the nature of      the mountains and of lofty places, and in order to contemplate the      plains place themselves upon high mountains, even so to understand      the nature of the people it needs to be a prince, and to      understand that of princes it needs to be of the people.\\nTake then, your Magnificence, this little gift in the spirit in      which I send it; wherein, if it be diligently read and considered      by you, you will learn my extreme desire that you should attain      that greatness which fortune and your other attributes promise.\\nAnd if your Magnificence from the summit of your greatness will      sometimes turn your eyes to these lower regions, you will see how      unmeritedly I suffer a great and continued malignity of fortune.\\nPrincipalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long established; or they are new.\\nThe new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of the King of Spain.\\nSuch dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.\\nIn doing so I will keep to the order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.\\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in \\'84, nor those of Pope Julius in \\'10, unless he had been long established in his dominions.\\nFor the hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.\\nAnd firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse.\\nThis follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition.\\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound to them.\\nFor, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.\\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it only needed Lodovico\\'s own forces; because those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince.\\nIt is very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the weakest places.\\nThus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.\\n(*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco      Sforza, who married Beatrice d\\'Este.\\nHe ruled over Milan      from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.\\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second time.\\nThe general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains to name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country and language, or they are not.\\nWhen they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and, although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves.\\nHe who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality.\\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language, customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there.\\nThis would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep it.\\nBecause, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them.\\nBesides this, the country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him.\\nHe who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty.\\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry.\\nA prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled.\\nIn conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt.\\nUpon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt.\\nFor every reason, therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful.\\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already.\\nThe Romans were brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants.\\nAnd the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power.\\nSo that in respect to those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has acquired there.\\nHe has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain entirely master in the country.\\nAnd he who does not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.\\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*) the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.\\nGreece appears to me sufficient for an example.\\nThe Achaeans and Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country.\\nBecause the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure.\\nThis it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them, there is no longer a remedy.\\nTherefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is for ever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\\n(*) See remark in the introduction on the word      \"intrattenere.\"\\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned.\\nI will speak of Louis(*) (and not of Charles)(+) as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a state composed of divers elements.\\n(*) Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People.\"\\nborn 1462, died 1515.\\n(+) Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention.\\nI will not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a foothold in Italy, and having no friends there--seeing rather that every door was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles--he was forced to accept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some mistakes.\\nThe king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the Sienese--everybody made advances to him to become his friend.\\nThen could the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king master of two-thirds of Italy.\\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself secure against those who remained powerful.\\nBut he was no sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna.\\nIt never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority.\\nAnd having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into Italy.\\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples, divides it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.\\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame.\\nTherefore, if France could have attacked Naples with her own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she ought not to have divided it.\\nAnd if the partition which she made with the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not the excuse of that necessity.\\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers, he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not send colonies.\\nWhich errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have consented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would never have consented except to become masters themselves there; also because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not have had the courage.\\nAnd if any one should say: \"King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war.\"\\nI answer for the reasons given above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage.\\nAnd if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the dissolution of his marriage(*) and for the cap to Rouen,(+) to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.\\n(*) Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis      XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles      VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the      crown.\\n(+) The Archbishop of Rouen.\\nHe was Georges d\\'Amboise,      created a cardinal by Alexander VI.\\nBorn 1460, died 1510.\\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and wished to retain them.\\nNor is there any miracle in this, but much that is reasonable and quite natural.\\nAnd on these matters I spoke at Nantes with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such greatness.\\nAnd in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be attributed to them.\\nFrom this a general rule is drawn which never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power.\\nI answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to be governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince.\\nSuch barons have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold them in natural affection.\\nThose states that are governed by a prince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.\\nThe examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the King of France.\\nThe entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as he chooses.\\nBut the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away except at his peril.\\nTherefore, he who considers both of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it.\\nThe causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him.\\nThis arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned.\\nHence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.\\nThe contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom, for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change.\\nSuch men, for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from those you have crushed.\\nNor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings the opportunity.\\nNow if you will consider what was the nature of the government of Darius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in the field, and then to take the country from him.\\nAfter which victory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the above reasons.\\nAnd if his successors had been united they would have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.\\nBut it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted like that of France.\\nHence arose those frequent rebellions against the Romans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities there were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them endured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed away, and the Romans then became secure possessors.\\nAnd when fighting afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed there; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other than the Romans were acknowledged.\\nWhen these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with which Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more; this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.\\nBecause such a government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand without his friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way.\\nThere are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans.\\nThe Spartans held Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy, nevertheless they lost them.\\nThe Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia, dismantled them, and did not lose them.\\nThey wished to hold Greece as the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did not succeed.\\nSo to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them.\\nAnd he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget.\\nAnd whatever you may do or provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges unless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they immediately rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in bondage by the Florentines.\\nBut when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern themselves.\\nFor this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily.\\nBut in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there.\\nA wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it.\\nLet him act like the clever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.\\nI say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them, accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state.\\nNow, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.\\nNevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the strongest.\\nFurther, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no other state, is compelled to reside there in person.\\nBut to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune, have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and such like are the most excellent examples.\\nAnd although one may not discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy to speak with God.\\nBut in considering Cyrus and others who have acquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be found inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor.\\nAnd in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material to mould into the form which seemed best to them.\\nWithout that opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.\\nIt was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of Israel in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of bondage.\\nIt was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland.\\nIt was necessary that Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of the Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace.\\nTheseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians dispersed.\\nThese opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate, and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby their country was ennobled and made famous.\\nThose who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease.\\nThe difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security.\\nAnd it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.\\nThis coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.\\nThus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.\\nIt is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force?\\nIn the first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass anything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they are rarely endangered.\\nHence it is that all armed prophets have conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed.\\nBesides the reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion.\\nAnd thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when they believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by force.\\nIf Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their constitutions for long--as happened in our time to Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to believe.\\nTherefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the ascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are overcome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated, they will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured, and happy.\\nTo these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind: it is Hiero the Syracusan.(*) This man rose from a private station to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to fortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him for their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince.\\nHe was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king.\\nThis man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old alliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on such foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.\\n(*) Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 B.C.\\nSuch are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as happened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens came to empire.\\nSuch stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated them--two most inconstant and unstable things.\\nNeither have they the knowledge requisite for the position; because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having always lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.\\nStates that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies(*) fixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps, and that those foundations, which others have laid BEFORE they became princes, they must lay AFTERWARDS.\\n(*) \"Le radici e corrispondenze.\"\\ntheir roots (i.e.\\nfoundations) and correspondencies or relations with other      states--a common meaning of \"correspondenc.\"\\nand      \"correspondenc.\"\\nin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\\nConcerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and these are Francesco Sforza(*) and Cesare Borgia.\\nFrancesco, by proper means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be Duke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties he kept with little trouble.\\nOn the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and fortunes of others had bestowed on him.\\n(*) Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466.\\nHe married      Bianca Maria Visconti, a natural daughter of Filippo      Visconti, the Duke of Milan, on whose death he procured his      own elevation to the duchy.\\nMachiavelli was the accredited      agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia (1478-      1507) during the transactions which led up to the      assassinations of the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and      along with his letters to his chiefs in Florence he has left      an account, written ten years before \"The Prince.\"\\nof the      proceedings of the duke in his \"Descritione del modo tenuto      dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli.\"\\netc., a translation of which is appended to the present      work.\\nBecause, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building.\\nIf, therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not consider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions; and if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.\\nAlexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had many immediate and prospective difficulties.\\nFirstly, he did not see his way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini were already under the protection of the Venetians.\\nBesides this, he saw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following.\\nIt behoved him, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to make himself securely master of part of their states.\\nThis was easy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of King Louis.\\nTherefore the king came into Italy with the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander.\\nHe was no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the king.\\nThe duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the same.\\nOf the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack.\\nAnd as to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others.\\nFor the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke.\\nAfter this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house.\\nThis came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia.\\nFrom this sprung the rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the French.\\nHaving restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor Pagolo--whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses--the Orsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power at Sinigalia.(*) Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained them all over to himself.\\nAnd as this point is worthy of notice, and to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.\\n(*) Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.\\nWhen the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it necessary to give it a good governor.\\nThereupon he promoted Messer Ramiro d\\'Orco,(*) a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest power.\\nThis man in a short time restored peace and unity with the greatest success.\\nAfterwards the duke considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the country, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their advocates.\\nAnd because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the natural sternness of the minister.\\nUnder this pretence he took Ramiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side.\\nThe barbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed.\\n(*) Ramiro d\\'Orco.\\nRamiro de Lorqua.\\nBut let us return whence we started.\\nI say that the duke, finding himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France, for he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would not support him.\\nAnd from this time he began to seek new alliances and to temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta.\\nIt was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.\\nSuch was his line of action as to present affairs.\\nBut as to the future he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways.\\nFirstly, by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the Pope.\\nSecondly, by winning to himself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their aid, as has been observed.\\nThirdly, by converting the college more to himself.\\nFourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first shock.\\nOf these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three.\\nFor he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college.\\nAnd as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection.\\nAnd as he had no longer to study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa.\\nAfter this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his own power and ability.\\nBut Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword.\\nHe left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick unto death.\\nYet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and he knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the foundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not had those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he would have overcome all difficulties.\\nAnd it is seen that his foundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a month.\\nIn Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst the Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they could not effect anything against him.\\nIf he could not have made Pope him whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected.\\nBut if he had been in sound health at the death of Alexander,(*) everything would have been different to him.\\nOn the day that Julius the Second(+) was elected, he told me that he had thought of everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had provided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that, when the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to die.\\n(*) Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.\\n(+) Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San      Pietro ad Vincula, born 1443, died 1513.\\nWhen all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to blame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of others, are raised to government.\\nBecause he, having a lofty spirit and far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness frustrated his designs.\\nTherefore, he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of things for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man.\\nOnly can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he made a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope to his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became pontiffs.\\nFor men injure either from fear or hatred.\\nThose whom he had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, San Giorgio, and Ascanio.(*) The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear him, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their relationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the kingdom of France having relations with him.\\nTherefore, above everything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and, failing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad Vincula.\\nHe who believes that new benefits will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived.\\nTherefore, the duke erred in his choice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.\\n(*) San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario.\\nAscanio is Ascanio      Sforza.\\nThese methods are when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private person becomes the prince of his country.\\nAnd speaking of the first method, it will be illustrated by two examples--one ancient, the other modern--and without entering further into the subject, I consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.\\nAgathocles, the Sicilian,(*) became King of Syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position.\\nThis man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life.\\nNevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse.\\nBeing established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was fighting in Sicily.\\nOne morning he assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion.\\nAnd although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the siege of Syracuse.\\nThe Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.\\n(*) Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.\\nTherefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers.\\nYet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not glory.\\nStill, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain.\\nNevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men.\\nWhat he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.\\nIn our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his youth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his discipline, he might attain some high position in the military profession.\\nAfter Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo, and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body and mind, he became the first man in his profession.\\nBut it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo.\\nSo he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also to that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.\\nGiovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew, and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo.\\nWhen the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him.\\nNo sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest.\\nAfter these murders Oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince.\\nHe killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his neighbours.\\nAnd his destruction would have been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was stated above.\\nThus one year after he had committed this parricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made his leader in valour and wickedness.\\nSome may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by means of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the state, still less in the doubtful times of war.\\nI believe that this follows from severities(*) being badly or properly used.\\nThose may be called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to one\\'s security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects.\\nThe badly employed are those which, notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than decrease.\\nThose who practise the first system are able, by aid of God or man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did.\\nIt is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.\\n(*) Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the      modern equivalent of Machiavelli\\'s thought when he speaks of      \"crudelt.\"\\nthan the more obvious \"cruelties.\"\\nHence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits.\\nHe who does otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs.\\nFor injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.\\nAnd above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any obligation to you for them.\\nI say then that such a principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the nobles.\\nBecause in all cities these two distinct parties are found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be ruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in cities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or anarchy.\\nA principality is created either by the people or by the nobles, accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions.\\nThe people, finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority.\\nHe who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule nor manage them to his liking.\\nBut he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.\\nBesides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress, while the former only desire not to be oppressed.\\nIt is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because of their being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself, as they are few in number.\\nThe worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to prevail.\\nFurther, the prince is compelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well without the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and to give or take away authority when it pleases him.\\nTherefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to be looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or they do not.\\nThose who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought to be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt with in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a natural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them, especially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in prosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them.\\nBut when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you, and a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they were open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.\\nTherefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him.\\nBut one who, in opposition to the people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection.\\nBecause men, when they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their favours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules, so I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the people friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.\\nNabis,(*) Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece, and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his country and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this would not have been sufficient had the people been hostile.\\nAnd do not let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that \"He who builds on the people, builds on the mud.\"\\nfor this is true when a private citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that the people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the magistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as happened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali(+) in Florence.\\nBut granted a prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole people encouraged--such a one will never find himself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.\\n(*) Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under      Flamininus in 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C.\\n(+) Messer Giorgio Scali.\\nThis event is to be found in      Machiavelli\\'s \"Florentine History.\"\\nBook III.\\nThese principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from the civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either rule personally or through magistrates.\\nIn the latter case their government is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on the goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and who, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with great ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not the chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the citizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates, are not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will always be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust.\\nFor such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when citizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with him; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its citizens, then he finds but few.\\nAnd so much the more is this experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once.\\nTherefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful.\\nAnd to make this quite clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls.\\nThe first case has been discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur.\\nIn the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.\\nAnd whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well fortified, and is not hated by his people.\\nThe cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country around them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them, because they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they always keep in public depots enough for one year\\'s eating, drinking, and firing.\\nAnd beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.\\nTherefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without being interfered with.\\nAnd whoever should reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.\\nFurther, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin the country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with their prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his defence.\\nFor it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they confer as much as by those they receive.\\nTherefore, if everything is well considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not fail to support and defend them.\\nThese princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are not taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care, and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves.\\nSuch principalities only are secure and happy.\\nBut being upheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\\nNevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have been called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest) have valued the temporal power very slightly--yet now a king of France trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and to ruin the Venetians--although this may be very manifest, it does not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\\nBefore Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,(*) this country was under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines.\\nThese potentates had two principal anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the other, that none of themselves should seize more territory.\\nThose about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians.\\nTo restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and powerless.\\nAnd although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyances.\\nAnd the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time to ruin the Orsini.\\nThis was the reason why the temporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy.\\n(*) Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\\nAlexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke.\\nAnd although his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke, nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church, which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all his labours.\\nPope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all the Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been practised before Alexander\\'s time.\\nSuch things Julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy.\\nAll of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person.\\nHe kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the disorders among them.\\nFor whenever these factions have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among the barons.\\nFor these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo(*) found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues.\\n(*) Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de\\' Medici.\\nWe have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to ruin.\\nThe chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed they have good laws.\\nI shall leave the laws out of the discussion and shall speak of the arms.\\nI say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.\\nMercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy.\\nThe fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you.\\nThey are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were.\\nThus it was that Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand;(*) and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have related.\\nAnd as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.\\n(*) \"With chalk in hand.\"\\n\"col gesso.\"\\nThis is one of the      _bons mots_ of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with      which Charles VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only      necessary for him to send his quartermasters to chalk up the      billets for his soldiers to conquer the country.\\nCf.\\n\"The      History of Henry VII.\"\\nby Lord Bacon: \"King Charles had      conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind      of a felicity of a dream.\\nHe passed the whole length of      Italy without resistance: so that it was true what Pope      Alexander was wont to say: That the Frenchmen came into      Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings,      rather than with swords to fight.\"\\nI wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms.\\nThe mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual way.\\nAnd if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way, whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in person and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so that he does not leave the command.\\nAnd experience has shown princes and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms.\\nRome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free.\\nThe Switzers are completely armed and quite free.\\nOf ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the Romans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains.\\nAfter the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their liberty.\\nDuke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,(*) allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters.\\nHis father, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna(+) of Naples, left her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms of the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom.\\nAnd if the Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their ambitions elsewhere.\\nOne who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,(%) and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have stood at his discretion.\\nSforza had the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other.\\nFrancesco turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples.\\nBut let us come to that which happened a short while ago.\\nThe Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest renown.\\nIf this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him.\\nThe Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly.\\nThis was before they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy.\\nAnd in the beginning of their expansion on land, through not having much territory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to fear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under Carmignuola,(#) they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him a most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership), and, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they feared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they were not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to secure themselves, to murder him.\\nThey had afterwards for their captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of Pitigliano,(&) and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,($) where in one battle they lost that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much trouble.\\nBecause from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.\\n(*) Battle of Caravaggio, 15th September 1448.\\n(+) Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of      Naples.\\n(%) Giovanni Acuto.\\nAn English knight whose name was Sir      John Hawkwood.\\nHe fought in the English wars in France, and      was knighted by Edward III; afterwards he collected a body      of troops and went into Italy.\\nThese became the famous      \"White Company.\"\\nHe took part in many wars, and died in      Florence in 1394.\\nHe was born about 1320 at Sible Hedingham,      a village in Essex.\\nHe married Domnia, a daughter of Bernabo      Visconti.\\n(#) Carmignuola.\\nFrancesco Bussone, born at Carmagnola about      1390, executed at Venice, 5th May 1432.\\n(&)

Machiavelli.\\nCount of Pitigliano; Nicolo Orsini, born 1442,      died 1510.\\n($) Battle of Vaila in 1509.\\nAnd as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been ruled for many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more seriously, in order that, having seen their rise and progress, one may be better prepared to counteract them.\\nYou must understand that the empire has recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired more temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more states, for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms against their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were oppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain authority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became princes.\\nFrom this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of priests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both commenced to enlist foreigners.\\nThe first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,(*) the Romagnian.\\nFrom the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy.\\nAfter these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the Switzers.\\nThe principle that has guided them has been, first, to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own.\\nThey did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers.\\nThey had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom.\\nThey did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter.\\nAll these things were permitted by their military rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt.\\n(*) Alberigo da Conio.\\nAlberico da Barbiano, Count of Cunio      in Romagna.\\nHe was the leader of the famous \"Company of St      George.\"\\ncomposed entirely of Italian soldiers.\\nHe died in      1409.\\nThese arms may be useful and good in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their captive.\\n(*) Ferdinand V (F.\\nII of Aragon and Sicily, F.\\nIII of      Naples), surnamed \"The Catholic.\"\\nborn 1542, died 1516.\\nAnd although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish to leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which cannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner.\\nBut his good fortune brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his rash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.\\nThe Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other time of their troubles.\\nThe Emperor of Constantinople,(*) to oppose his neighbours, sent ten thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not willing to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to the infidels.\\n(*) Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.\\nTherefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms, for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them the ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to others; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and better opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one community, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you have made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough authority to injure you.\\nIn conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous; in auxiliaries, valour.\\nThe wise prince, therefore, has always avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing rather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.\\nI shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions.\\nThis duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men.\\nAnd the difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.\\nI was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I have named above.\\nThis man, as I have said, made head of the army by the Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he could neither keep them not let them go, he had them all cut to pieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens.\\nI wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament applicable to this subject.\\nDavid offered himself to Saul to fight with Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to meet the enemy with his sling and his knife.\\nIn conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast.\\nCharles the Seventh,(*) the father of King Louis the Eleventh,(+) having by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry.\\nAfterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they can now conquer without them.\\nHence it arises that the French cannot stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come off well against others.\\nThe armies of the French have thus become mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much inferior to one\\'s own forces.\\nAnd this example proves it, for the kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had been enlarged or maintained.\\n(*) Charles VII of France, surnamed \"The Victorious.\"\\nborn      1403, died 1461.\\n(+) Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.\\nBut the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have said above of hectic fevers.\\nTherefore, if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise; and this insight is given to few.\\nAnd if the first disaster to the Roman Empire(*) should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour which had raised it passed away to others.\\n(*) \"Many speakers to the House the other night in the      debate on the reduction of armaments seemed to show a most      lamentable ignorance of the conditions under which the      British Empire maintains its existence.\\nWhen Mr Balfour      replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under      the weight of its military obligations, he said that this      was \\'wholly unhistorical.\\' He might well have added that the      Roman power was at its zenith when every citizen      acknowledged his liability to fight for the State, but that      it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer      recognized.\"--Pall Mall Gazette, 15th May 1906.\\nI conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it.\\nAnd it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength.\\nAnd one\\'s own forces are those which are composed either of subjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries.\\nAnd the way to make ready one\\'s own forces will be easily found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many republics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which rules I entirely commit myself.\\nAnd, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states.\\nAnd the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the art.\\nFrancesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons.\\nFor among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard himself, as is shown later on.\\nBecause there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants.\\nBecause, there being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together.\\nAnd therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them.\\nHe ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.\\nAs regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care.\\nWhich knowledge is useful in two ways.\\nFirstly, he learns to know his country, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance to those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others.\\nAnd the prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege towns to advantage.\\nPhilopoemen,(*) Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \"If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage?\\nHow should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks?\\nIf we should wish to retreat, how ought we to pursue?\"\\nAnd he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.\\n(*) Philopoemen, \"the last of the Greeks.\"\\nborn 252 B.C.,      died 183 B.C.\\nBut to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat, so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus.\\nAnd whoever reads the life of Cyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon.\\nA wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his resources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it may find him prepared to resist her blows.\\nAnd as I know that many have written on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of other people.\\nBut, it being my intention to write a thing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil.\\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.\\nTherefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like.\\nAnd I know that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them.\\nAnd again, he need not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\\nNevertheless, liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach of its opposite.\\nTherefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do everything he can to get money.\\nThis will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.\\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in time he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself against all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have been considered mean; the rest have failed.\\nPope Julius the Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he did not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long thriftiness.\\nThe present King of Spain would not have undertaken or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal.\\nA prince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will enable him to govern.\\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and many others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal, and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact, or in a way to become one.\\nIn the first case this liberality is dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal; and Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome; but if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his expenses, he would have destroyed his government.\\nAnd if any one should reply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends that which is his own or his subjects\\' or else that of others.\\nIn the first case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality.\\nAnd to the prince who goes forth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers.\\nAnd of that which is neither yours nor your subjects\\' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures you.\\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated.\\nAnd a prince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both.\\nTherefore it is wiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred, than to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\\nNevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency.\\nCesare Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty.\\nAnd if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.(*) Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the individual only.\\n(*) During the rioting between the Cancellieri and      Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.\\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers.\\nHence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign owing to its being new, saying:       \"Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt      Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.\"(*)  Nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable.\\n(*) .\\n.\\n.\\nagainst my will, my fate      A throne unsettled, and an infant state,      Bid me defend my realms with all my pow\\'rs,      And guard with these severities my shores.\\nChristopher Pitt.\\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved?\\nIt may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with.\\nBecause this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you.\\nAnd that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women.\\nBut when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others, because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony.\\nBesides, pretexts for taking away the property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse.\\nBut when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or disposed to its duties.\\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune.\\nThis arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect.\\nAnd short-sighted writers admire his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of them.\\nThat it is true his other virtues would not have been sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man, against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more license than is consistent with military discipline.\\nFor this he was upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of the Roman soldiery.\\nThe Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature.\\nInsomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others.\\nThis disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed itself, but contributed to his glory.\\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\\nBurd, \"Il      Principe.\"\\np.\\n297.\\nEvery one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft.\\nNevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word.\\nYou must know there are two ways of contesting,(*) the one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second.\\nTherefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man.\\nThis has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable.\\nA prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves.\\nTherefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves.\\nThose who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about.\\nTherefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer.\\nIf men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them.\\nNor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance.\\nOf this endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.\\n(*) \"Contesting.\"\\ni.e.\\n\"striving for mastery.\"\\nMr Burd      points out that this passage is imitated directly from      Cicero\\'s \"De Officiis\": \"Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi,      unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud      proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad      posterius, si uti non licet superiore.\"\\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived.\\nOne recent example I cannot pass over in silence.\\nAlexander the Sixth did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes,(*) because he well understood this side of mankind.\\n(*) \"Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad      votum).\"\\nThe words \"ad votu.\"\\nare omitted in the Testina      addition, 1550.\\nAlexander never did what he said,      Cesare never said what he did.\\nItalian Proverb.\\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them.\\nAnd I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.\\nAnd you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,(*) friendship, humanity, and religion.\\nTherefore it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to set about it.\\n(*) \"Contrary to fidelit.\"\\nor \"faith.\"\\n\"contro alla fede.\"\\nand \"tutto fede.\"\\n\"altogether faithful.\"\\nin the next      paragraph.\\nIt is noteworthy that these two phrases, \"contro      alla fed.\"\\nand \"tutto fede.\"\\nwere omitted in the Testina      edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal      authorities.\\nIt may be that the meaning attached to the word      \"fed.\"\\nwas \"the faith.\"\\ni.e.\\nthe Catholic creed, and not as      rendered here \"fidelit.\"\\nand \"faithful.\"\\nObserve that the      word \"religion.\"\\nwas suffered to stand in the text of the      Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of      belief, as witness \"the religion.\"\\na phrase inevitably      employed to designate the Huguenot heresy.\\nSouth in his      Sermon IX, p.\\n69, ed.\\n1843, comments on this passage as      follows: \"That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,      Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his      political scheme: \\'That the show of religion was helpful to      the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and      pernicious..\"\\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious.\\nThere is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you.\\nEvery one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.\\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on.\\nOne prince(*) of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time.\\n(*) Ferdinand of Aragon.\\n\"When Machiavelli was writing \\'The      Prince\\' it would have been clearly impossible to mention      Ferdinand\\'s name here without giving offence.\"\\nBurd\\'s \"Il      Principe.\"\\np.\\n308.\\nIt makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from both of which he must abstain.\\nAnd when neither their property nor their honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many ways.\\nIt makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him.\\nThat prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty.\\nFor this reason a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers.\\nFrom the latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies, and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should affairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\\nBut concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for him to accomplish, as I said above at length.\\nAnd one of the most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite.\\nAnd as experience shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.\\nAnd, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire.\\nFor whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot hope for any escape.\\nEndless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers.\\nMesser Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer Giovanni,(*) who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi.\\nThis sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in Bologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.\\n(*) Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan      1508.\\nHe ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506.\\nMachiavelli\\'s      strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from      his own very recent experience (February 1513), when he had      been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the      Boscoli conspiracy.\\nFor this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody.\\nAnd well-ordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have.\\nAmong the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king.\\nNeither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of security to the king and kingdom.\\nFrom this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in their own hands.\\nAnd further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.\\nIt may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against them.\\nWishing, therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times.\\nIt seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\\nThere is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelty.\\nHence it arose that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people.\\nWhich course was necessary, because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful.\\nTherefore, those emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\\nFrom these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title, and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards, being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor despised.\\nBut Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers, who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus, having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his administration.\\nAnd here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself--it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles--you have to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do you harm.\\nBut let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness, that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the army conspired against him, and murdered him.\\nTurning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and satisfied.\\nAnd because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate.\\nKnowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known that he had started.\\nOn his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian.\\nAfter this there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne.\\nAnd as he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus.\\nTo the latter he wrote that, being elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true.\\nBut after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him.\\nAfterwards he sought him out in France, and took from him his government and life.\\nHe who will, therefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived against him for his violence.\\nBut his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies.\\nNevertheless, his ferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of Alexandria.\\nHe became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion.\\nAnd here it must be noted that such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state.\\nAntoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and proved the emperor\\'s ruin.\\nBut let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.\\nIt remains to discuss the character of Maximinus.\\nHe was a very warlike man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander, of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the throne.\\nThis he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great indignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity by having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire, practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity.\\nFirst Africa rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter, besieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so many against him, murdered him.\\nI do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that are veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.\\nFrom the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them his friends.\\nThe kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people, he must keep them his friends.\\nBut you must note that the state of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by those who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen.\\nAnd this being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary lord.\\nBut returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to unhappy ones.\\nBecause it would have been useless and dangerous for Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly destructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in his footsteps.\\nTherefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm.\\n1.\\nSome princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their subjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions; others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning of their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown and destroyed them.\\nAnd although one cannot give a final judgment on all of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those states in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as comprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.\\n2.\\nThere never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your subjects become your adherents.\\nAnd whereas all subjects cannot be armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter, considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most reward, excuse you.\\nBut when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you.\\nAnd because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects.\\nTherefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always distributed arms.\\nHistories are full of examples.\\nBut when a prince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\\n3.\\nOur forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily.\\nThis may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use; rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist.\\nThe Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them.\\nWhich, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state.\\nSuch methods argue, therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if war comes this policy proves fallacious.\\n4.\\nWithout doubt princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a ladder which his enemies have raised.\\nFor this reason many consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher.\\n5.\\nPrinces, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted.\\nPandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by others.\\nBut on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect his affairs.\\nAnd since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy them.\\nAnd weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.\\n6.\\nIt has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack.\\nI praise this system because it has been made use of formerly.\\nNotwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision.\\nFortresses, therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one way they injure you in another.\\nAnd this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone.\\nThe castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state.\\nFor this reason the best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you.\\nIt has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,(*) when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist the people.\\nBut fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners.\\nTherefore, it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses.\\nAll these things considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.\\n(*) Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and      Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509.\\nIt was to the      Countess of Forli that Machiavelli was sent as envy on 1499.\\nA letter from Fortunati to the countess announces the      appointment: \"I have been with the signori.\"\\nwrote      Fortunati, \"to learn whom they would send and when.\\nThey      tell me that Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine      noble, secretary to my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me      at once.\"\\nCf.\\n\"Catherine Sforza.\"\\nby Count Pasolini,      translated by P.\\nSylvester, 1898.\\nWe have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the present King of Spain.\\nHe can almost be called a new prince, because he has risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be the foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary.\\nIn the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions.\\nHe did this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them.\\nHe was able with the money of the Church and of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.\\nFurther, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable example, nor one more rare.\\nUnder this same cloak he assailed Africa, he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them.\\nAnd his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against him.\\nAgain, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da Milano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life doing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some method of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about.\\nAnd a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.\\nA prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not.\\nIn either case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to protect or to shelter you.\\nBecause he who conquers does not want doubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in hand, court his fate.\\nAntiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive out the Romans.\\nHe sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the Romans urged them to take up arms.\\nThis question came to be discussed in the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged them to stand neutral.\\nTo this the Roman legate answered: \"As for that which has been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your state not to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous; because by not interfering you will be left, without favour or consideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.\"\\nThus it will always happen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with arms.\\nAnd irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are generally ruined.\\nBut when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you.\\nVictories after all are never so complete that the victor must not show some regard, especially to justice.\\nBut if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you become companions on a fortune that may rise again.\\nIn the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with your assistance, he remains at your discretion.\\nAnd here it is to be noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with one more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others, unless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers you are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as possible being at the discretion of any one.\\nThe Venetians joined with France against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their ruin, could have been avoided.\\nBut when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of the parties.\\nNever let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones, because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to take the lesser evil.\\nA prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour the proficient in every art.\\nAt the same time he should encourage his citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken away from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but the prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things and designs in any way to honour his city or state.\\nFurther, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into guilds or into societies,(*) he ought to hold such bodies in esteem, and associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of courtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty of his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.\\n(*) \"Guilds or societies.\"\\n\"in arti o in tribu.\"\\n\"Art.\"\\nwere      craft or trade guilds, cf.\\nFlorio: \"Arte .\\n.\\n.\\na whole      company of any trade in any city or corporation town.\"\\nThe      guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr      Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject (Methuen, 1906).\\nInstitutions of a somewhat similar character, called      \"artel.\"\\nexist in Russia to-day, cf.\\nSir Mackenzie Wallace\\'s      \"Russia.\"\\ned.\\n1905: \"The sons .\\n.\\n.\\nwere always during the      working season members of an artel.\\nIn some of the larger      towns there are artels of a much more complex kind--      permanent associations, possessing large capital, and      pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual      members.\"\\nThe word \"artel.\"\\ndespite its apparent similarity,      has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with \"ar.\"\\nor      \"arte.\"\\nIts root is that of the verb \"rotisya.\"\\nto bind      oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only      another form of \"rota.\"\\nwhich now signifies a \"regimental      company.\"\\nIn both words the underlying idea is that of a      body of men united by an oath.\\n\"Trib.\"\\nwere possibly gentile      groups, united by common descent, and included individuals      connected by marriage.\\nPerhaps our words \"sect.\"\\nor \"clan.\"\\nwould be most appropriate.\\nAnd the first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful.\\nBut when they are otherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error which he made was in choosing them.\\nThere were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant.\\nBecause there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless.\\nTherefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.\\nBut to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one test which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in his hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince, and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.\\nOn the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he cannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more, many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him dread chances.\\nWhen, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants, are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise, the end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.\\nIt is that of flatterers, of whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they run the danger of falling into contempt.\\nBecause there is no other way of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that to tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell you the truth, respect for you abates.\\nTherefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires, and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions.\\nWith these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be steadfast in his resolutions.\\nHe who does otherwise is either overthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions that he falls into contempt.\\nI wish on this subject to adduce a modern example.\\nFra Luca, the man of affairs to Maximilian,(*) the present emperor, speaking of his majesty, said: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.\\nThis arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the above; for the emperor is a secretive man--he does not communicate his designs to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them.\\nBut as in carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being pliant, is diverted from them.\\nHence it follows that those things he does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.\\n(*) Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the      Holy Roman Empire.\\nHe married, first, Mary, daughter of      Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus      became involved in Italian politics.\\nA prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be felt.\\nAnd if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good advisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived, because this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not wise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has yielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very prudent man.\\nIn this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would not be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take away his state from him.\\nBut if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to unite them.\\nEach of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them.\\nAnd they are not to found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint.\\nTherefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good counsels.\\nFor the actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an hereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men and bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more by the present than by the past, and when they find the present good they enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost defence of a prince if he fails them not in other things.\\nThus it will be a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and adorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and with a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a prince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom.\\nAnd if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known how to secure the nobles.\\nIn the absence of these defects states that have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.\\nPhilip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles, he sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the kingdom.\\nTherefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their principalities after so many years\\' possession, but rather their own sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that the people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would recall them.\\nThis course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would never wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later on to restore you.\\nThis again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.\\nThis opinion has been more credited in our times because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture.\\nSometimes pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.\\nNevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true that Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,(*) but that she still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.\\n(*) Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: \"The older      one gets the more convinced one becomes that his Majesty      King Chance does three-quarters of the business of this      miserable universe.\"\\nSorel\\'s \"Eastern Question.\"\\nI compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to its violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet, though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences and barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous.\\nSo it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain her.\\nAnd if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open country without barriers and without any defence.\\nFor if it had been defended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it would not have come at all.\\nAnd this I consider enough to say concerning resistance to fortune in general.\\nBut confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character.\\nThis, I believe, arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes.\\nI believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful.\\nBecause men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method.\\nOne can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times.\\nThis follows from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the other does not.\\nChanges in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course of action.\\nBut a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it is well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined; but had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed.\\nPope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of action that he always met with success.\\nConsider his first enterprise against Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive.\\nThe Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him.\\nTherefore Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded.\\nBecause the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a thousand fears.\\nI will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\\nI conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out.\\nFor my part I consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly.\\nShe is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.\\nAnd if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate the capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to discover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy should be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should be more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians, more scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten, despoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.\\nAlthough lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected him; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of Lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, and cleanse those sores that for long have festered.\\nIt is seen how she entreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous insolencies.\\nIt is seen also that she is ready and willing to follow a banner if only someone will raise it.\\nNor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope than in your illustrious house,(*) with its valour and fortune, favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and which could be made the head of this redemption.\\nThis will not be difficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the men I have named.\\nAnd although they were great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and each one of them had no more opportunity than the present offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was God more their friend than He is yours.\\n(*) Giuliano de Medici.\\nHe had just been created a cardinal      by Leo X.\\nIn 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the      title of Clement VII.\\nWith us there is great justice, because that war is just which is necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in them.\\nHere there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those men to whom I have directed your attention.\\nFurther than this, how extraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example: the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth water, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your greatness; you ought to do the rest.\\nGod is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.\\nAnd it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many campaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted, this has happened because the old order of things was not good, and none of us have known how to find a new one.\\nAnd nothing honours a man more than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was newly risen.\\nSuch things when they are well founded and dignified will make him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting opportunities to bring such into use in every form.\\nHere there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.\\nLook attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how superior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety.\\nBut when it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are capable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there having never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by valour or fortune, that others would yield to him.\\nHence it is that for so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.(*)       (*) The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,      1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better soldiers.\\nAnd although singly they are good, altogether they will be much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince, honoured by him, and maintained at his expense.\\nTherefore it is necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners by Italian valour.\\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be relied upon to overthrow them.\\nFor the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat.\\nOwing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry.\\nAnd although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been over with them.\\nIt is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old.\\nAnd these are the kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new prince.\\nThis opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for letting Italy at last see her liberator appear.\\nNor can one express the love with which he would be received in all those provinces which have suffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.\\nWhat door would be closed to him?\\nWho would refuse obedience to him?\\nWhat envy would hinder him?\\nWhat Italian would refuse him homage?\\nTo all of us this barbarous dominion stinks.\\nLet, therefore, your illustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with which all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard our native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that saying of Petrarch:       Virtu contro al Furore      Prendera l\\'arme, e fia il combatter corto:      Che l\\'antico valore      Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.\\nVirtue against fury shall advance the fight,      And it i\\' th\\' combat soon shall put to flight:      For the old Roman valour is not dead,      Nor in th\\' Italians\\' brests extinguished.\\nEdward Dacre, 1640.\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI  BY  NICOLO MACHIAVELLI   The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been raised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.\\nThese matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek to destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy.\\nUpon this a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci, the Prince of Siena.\\nHere were discussed the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined.\\nAnd they decided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the Florentines; and they send their men to one place and another, promising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite with them against the common enemy.\\nThis meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution.\\nThus it arose that, men\\'s minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held for the duke, and which they captured by the following means.\\nThe castellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there; so the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being carried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from being drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge and thence into the fortress.\\nUpon this capture being effected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being encouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the Diet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.\\nThose who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they ought not to wait for another opportunity.\\nBut the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies.\\nThe duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against everybody\\'s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door.\\nBut recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance.\\nThis latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.\\nNotwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them.\\nWhen this happened, the duke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the principality.\\nAnd the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a standstill.\\nBut the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in separate parties to every part of the Romagna.\\nIn the meanwhile there came also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open war, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to outwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of reconciliation.\\nAnd that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so.\\nOn the other hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and other places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and not to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his permission.\\nThis reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino, again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.\\nBut the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed his men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia.\\nTo this the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very willing to proceed against Sinigalia.\\nIt happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to come there.\\nThis appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being invited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no suspicions.\\nAnd the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French men-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred lancers under Mons.\\ndi Candales, his brother-in-law.\\nHe left Cesena about the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils of his friends.\\nBut Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed to wait.\\nUpon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d\\'Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they reached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they came to the duke\\'s quarters, where they should be seized.\\nThe duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from Fano, and await him there.\\nHe found himself, therefore, on the last day of December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of about two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the infantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.\\nFano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situate on the shore of the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases of which are touched by the sea in some places.\\nThe city of Sinigalia is distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot and from the shore about a mile.\\nOn the side opposite to the city runs a little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano, facing the high road.\\nThus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which passes by Sinigalia.\\nIf he turns to his left hand along the bank of it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely.\\nBefore this gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side.\\nThe Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and to honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band, which consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above.\\nMatters having been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and when the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and the other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.\\nVitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his approaching death--a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the man and his former fortune, caused some amazement.\\nAnd it is said that when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them.\\nHe recommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers that should be kept in mind.\\nThese three, therefore, came before the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were commissioned to look after them.\\nBut the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in Sinigalia, was missing--for Oliverotto was waiting in the square before his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling them--signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that Oliverotto should not escape.\\nTherefore Don Michele rode off and joined Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke; and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet the duke.\\nAnd Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.\\nSo the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke\\'s quarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms.\\nThose of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the country and saved themselves.\\nBut the duke\\'s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have completely sacked it.\\nNight having come and the tumult being silenced, the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a room and caused them to be strangled.\\nNeither of them used words in keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo.\\nPagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce.\\nAfter which news, on 18th January 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.\\nTHE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA  WRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI  And sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI   CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328  It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them, who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way.\\nThey have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some other deity.\\nIt would be wearisome to relate who these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read them, they are omitted.\\nI believe that these lowly beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all success must be attributed to her.\\nCastruccio Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course of this history will show.\\nIt appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men.\\nI think also that I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.\\nThe family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in estate, as so often happens in this world.\\nTo this family was born a son Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio.\\nHe had an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live with her brother.\\nMesser Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could have access to it without difficulty.\\nOne morning, shortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something resembling the cry of an infant.\\nWhereupon she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother.\\nPartly wondering and partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home.\\nWhen he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised or compassionate than his sister.\\nThey discussed between themselves what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no children, they finally determined to bring it up.\\nThey had a nurse for it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child.\\nThey baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father.\\nAs the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him.\\nMesser Antonio intended to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was quite unfitted for the priesthood.\\nAs soon as Castruccio reached the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms, delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys.\\nIn all exercises he far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty deeds of men.\\nMesser Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow.\\nThere lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family, named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches, bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca.\\nHe had often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca.\\nThis gentleman resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street in those games of which I have spoken.\\nNoticing that Castruccio far excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was.\\nBeing informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater desire to have him near to him.\\nTherefore he called him one day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the services of the Church.\\nMesser Francesco could see that it pleased Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable, nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier.\\nThis reply delighted Messer Francesco, and in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer.\\nThus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman.\\nIn the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity.\\nBut what enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals, and courteous to his inferiors.\\nThese gifts made him beloved, not only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca.\\nWhen Castruccio had reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.\\nCastruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all Lombardy.\\nCastruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation that he left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary for that purpose.\\nAbout this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to be his son\\'s tutor and administrator of his estate.\\nBefore he died Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father.\\nUpon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical intentions.\\nAmong these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the head of the Guelph party.\\nThis man hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence.\\nCastruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him driven out of Lucca.\\nThe Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo, who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became their lord.\\nThere resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca, with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting their restoration by the help of Uguccione.\\nCastruccio also brought into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the Opizi.\\nHaving fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days in case of need.\\nWhen the night came which had been agreed upon with Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the portcullis.\\nCastruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side.\\nUguccione entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters.\\nThe governor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time.\\nOf those who fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.\\nAs it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca.\\nThey assembled a large army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca.\\nUpon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and Pescia.\\nUguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence.\\nOwing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the enemy.\\nUguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio.\\nThis change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew over-confident.\\nCastruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used.\\nOn the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio.\\nPresently, deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided to join battle with them.\\nFirst he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands.\\nCastruccio had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre.\\nObserving this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy him.\\nHe then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings.\\nThus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other.\\nBy this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio\\'s men were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy\\'s troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks.\\nSo, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying their valour.\\nThe defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto.\\nOn the part of Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the first onset.\\nThis victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of power, but rather than diminished it.\\nBeing of this mind, he only waited for an opportunity to give effect to it.\\nThis occurred on the death of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge.\\nOn the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped.\\nThis affair coming to the knowledge of Uguccione, who was than at Pisa, it appeared to him a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio.\\nHe therefore sent for his son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death.\\nCastruccio, fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained at supper, and then thrown into prison.\\nBut Neri, fearing to put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions.\\nUgucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their lord.\\nBefore Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against him.\\nBut the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city.\\nThey first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be set at liberty.\\nUguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him from prison.\\nWhereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.\\nBut Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca, and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people that they appointed him captain of their army for one year.\\nHaving obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a treaty, he marched to Serezzana.\\nTo capture this place he constructed a fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of two months Castruccio captured the town.\\nWith the reputation gained at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana.\\nIn order to close the pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the lord of it.\\nAfter this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by the whole people.\\nAnd now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people.\\nAt this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred horsemen.\\nCastruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the people\\'s love for the memory of his father.\\nCastruccio was received in great honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was appointed the emperor\\'s lieutenant in Tuscany.\\nAt this time the Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick.\\nFrederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to accept him as their lord.\\nFrederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian affairs, returned to Germany.\\nAll the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country, if enabled to recover it with his assistance.\\nAmong these exiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines.\\nCastruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the country districts.\\nAs Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa.\\nWhile he surrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto.\\nMesser Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves.\\nCastruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country.\\nWhereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.\\nThere resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca.\\nThey found their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him.\\nThey endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what they desired.\\nTherefore they laid down their arms with no greater intelligence than they had taken them up.\\nCastruccio, having heard the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.\\nContrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city.\\nAs it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf, for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to their house.\\nTo this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its inception.\\nHe encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his clemency and liberality.\\nUpon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and put to death.\\nMeanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him.\\nHe approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it.\\nA treaty was concluded with them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had made.\\nCastruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to be trusted.\\nThen for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the state.\\nWhilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of increasing his importance elsewhere.\\nIt appeared to him that if he could get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was his great desire.\\nHe, therefore, in various ways made friends with the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties confided their secrets to him.\\nPistoia was divided, as it always had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia.\\nEach of these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to blows.\\nJacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance.\\nHe gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi.\\nAt the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and both were admitted as friends.\\nThus the two leaders entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans of either faction.\\nWithout further opposition Pistoia passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them many promises and remitting their old debts.\\nThe countryside flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great valour.\\nAbout this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon.\\nThe German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened--murders and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end to them.\\nThis caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the city, and bring back the Pope.\\nHaving no nearer friend to whom he could apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome.\\nCastruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome.\\nLeaving Pagolo Guinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction.\\nIn a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble.\\nWhen he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico.\\nCastruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator.\\nThis dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its front: \"I am what God wills.\"\\nWhilst on the back was: \"What God desires shall be.\"\\nDuring this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult in his absence.\\nAmong the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger.\\nThese men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out some of Castruccio\\'s officials and partisans, and killing others, they restored the city to its freedom.\\nThe news of this greatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to Pistoia.\\nWhen the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his road to Pistoia.\\nAssembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories.\\nOn the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard where the Florentines\\' lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle.\\nHe believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand.\\nAlthough he had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers.\\nSerravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it.\\nThe lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either--neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one.\\nFor these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his position.\\nIt was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not stand.\\nAs soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put to death.\\nCastruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his army from Montecarlo.\\nThus the Florentines hurried on until they reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the following morning.\\nIn the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning.\\nCastruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle.\\nThe Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the castle.\\nThus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors.\\nIt was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own, although some few of them got through.\\nWhen the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion.\\nThe cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done.\\nIn a short time the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy\\'s infantry were scattered or killed without having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout resistance.\\nRetreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their friends.\\nWhen Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole force to fall upon the flank of the enemy.\\nThese orders they carried out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack, but gave way, and were soon in full retreat--conquered more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy.\\nThose in the rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man seeking only his own safety.\\nThe defeat was complete and very sanguinary.\\nMany captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs.\\nImmediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio.\\nHe was not content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola, about two miles from Florence.\\nHere he remained many days, dividing the spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding horse races, and foot races for men and women.\\nHe also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines.\\nHe endeavoured to corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi.\\nThis defeat caused the Florentines great anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause was to him, accepted it.\\nHe agreed with the Florentines to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he send his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.\\nShortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the pressure of Castruccio\\'s army, owing to his being compelled to leave his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi, one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the Lucchese.\\nHe had formed this conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of Castruccio, and drive out the garrison.\\nAs, however, in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.\\nThis betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering their banishment in Pisa.\\nThereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their families into exile.\\nIt now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo, the son of the King of Naples.\\nWhen Carlo arrived they decided to lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry--having called to their aid every Guelph there was in Italy.\\nThey consulted whether they should attack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on the latter--a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.\\nIn the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from thence on to San Miniato.\\nWhen Castruccio heard of the enormous army which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle.\\nHe assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand infantry.\\nFucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain.\\nMoreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack Castruccio\\'s forces except at a disadvantage.\\nIn one case they would find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an undertaking of great hazard.\\nIn order to tempt the Florentines to take this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide expanse of land between them and the river.\\nThe Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and, having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the latter.\\nThe river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the saddles of the horsemen.\\nOn the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry.\\nCastruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno.\\nThe infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not move.\\nWhen the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for landing.\\nThese men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry.\\nThe horses, alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great confusion.\\nThe fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield.\\nThe soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains.\\nCastruccio shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the few.\\nAt length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left.\\nThis cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield.\\nBut when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio\\'s reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the river.\\nThe cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work of the cavalry.\\nThis fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy.\\nThis they did with lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight.\\nThe Florentine captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio\\'s army.\\nBut here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless.\\nThus the Florentines were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory.\\nMany captains were taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to Empoli.\\nIf the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle.\\nOf the Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.\\nBut Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death could have stopped him.\\nCastruccio was in the thick of the battle the whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return from victory and personally thank them.\\nHe was also on the watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day; he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the first man in the saddle and the last out of it.\\nHere Castruccio stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was the cause of his death.\\nOn the following night he was attacked with high fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove fatal.\\nCastruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and addressed him as follows:  \"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils, because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and Pisa.\\nI should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the Florentines with so many injuries.\\nBut I would have made both these peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one more secure and established on a surer foundation.\\nBut Fortune, who insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time to surmount it.\\nThou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a boy--a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should feel--and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been witness.\\nWhen thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show.\\nAnd in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father.\\nThus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure.\\nThou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under they government.\\nThou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese.\\nPistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently inflicted upon them.\\nThou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the acquisition of all Tuscany.\\nIn the Emperor and in the princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their help is very long in coming.\\nTherefore, thou hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee.\\nAnd whereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages and security.\\nIt is of the greatest important in this world that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace.\\nAnd it will be well for thee to rule they conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true.\\nAnd thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.\"\\nAfter this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he died.\\nHe left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he was.\\nHis obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried in San Francesco at Lucca.\\nFortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the abilities.\\nNot long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca.\\nThis latter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.\\nFrom what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time, but also by those of an earlier date.\\nIn stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned.\\nHe was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased.\\nHis hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a hat.\\nHe was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it.\\nNo one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself.\\nHe was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that the weak are chastised by the strong.\\nHe was also wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered with others did not show it to him.\\nIt has often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the following occasions.\\nHe had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had said: \"You would not have given more than a penny.\"\\n\"That is true.\"\\nanswered the friend.\\nThen said Castruccio to him: \"A ducat is much less to me.\"\\nHaving about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \"Fisherman are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they make take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may catch a whale\"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience but rewarded.\\nWhen told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \"If that be a vice than you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.\"\\nPassing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: \"Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.\"\\nA friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: \"Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.\"\\nCastruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: \"You are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best to eat.\"\\nand was answered: \"We are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest need of them.\"\\nGoing by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear anything.\\nCastruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was worth.\\nBeing asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: \"When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon another.\"\\nTo a person who was boasting that he had read many things, Castruccio said: \"He knows better than to boast of remembering many things.\"\\nSomeone bragged that he could drink much without becoming intoxicated.\\nCastruccio replied: \"An ox does the same.\"\\nCastruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: \"She has not taken me in, I have taken her.\"\\nBeing also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered: \"Thou dost not spend as much as I do?\"\\nand being told that it was true, he continued: \"Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.\"\\nBeing invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring.\\nCastruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: \"I knew not where to spit in order to offend thee less.\"\\nBeing asked how Caesar died he said: \"God willing I will die as he did.\"\\nBeing one night in the house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: \"He who is considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night.\"\\nA person came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by Castruccio, said: \"Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast thy ears in thy feet.\"\\nwhereupon he obtained double the favour he had asked.\\nCastruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled blindfolded.\\nBeing asked a favour by one who used many superfluous words, he said to him: \"When you have another request to make, send someone else to make it.\"\\nHaving been wearied by a similar man with a long oration who wound up by saying: \"Perhaps I have fatigued you by speaking so long.\"\\nCastruccio said: \"You have not, because I have not listened to a word you said.\"\\nHe used to say of one who had been a beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he took the wives from their husbands.\\nTo an envious man who laughed, he said: \"Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is unfortunate?\"\\nWhilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: \"What shall I give you if you will let me give you a blow on the nose?\"\\nCastruccio answered: \"A helmet.\"\\nHaving put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived themselves; he had only killed a new enemy.\\nCastruccio praised greatly those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused when the time came.\\nHe said that it always struck him with surprise that whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with only looking at her.\\nHe was once asked in what manner he would wish to be buried when he died, and answered: \"With the face turned downwards, for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.\"\\nOn being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della Faggiuola to the Inferno.\\nHe was once asked when should a man eat to preserve his health, and replied: \"If the man be rich let him eat when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.\"\\nSeeing on of his gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: \"I pray God that you will let him feed you also.\"\\nSeeing that someone had written upon his house in Latin the words: \"May God preserve this house from the wicked.\"\\nhe said, \"The owner must never go in.\"\\nPassing through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and remarked: \"That house will fly through the door.\"\\nHe was having a discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king.\\n\"Is this king of yours a bad man or a good one?\"\\nasked Castruccio, and was told that he was a good one, whereupon he said, \"Why should you suggest that I should be afraid of a good man?\"\\nI could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his high qualities.\\nHe lived forty-four years, and was in every way a prince.\\nAnd as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune, so he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune; therefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be seen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were placed by him to testify for ever to his days of adversity.\\nAs in his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia or Rome.\\n\\nAn Attempt at No.\\nThe Pic-nic--Huck on Injun

Transformed  Comfortable Once More  High up in Society  Contentment     PREFACE  Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine.\\nHuck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an individual--he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.\\nThe odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at the period of this story--that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.\\nAlthough my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account, for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.\\nTHE AUTHOR.\\nHARTFORD, 1876.\\nNo answer.\\n\"TOM.\"\\nNo answer.\\n\"What\\'s gone with that boy, \\xa0I wonder?\\nYou TOM.\"\\nNo answer.\\nThe old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them.\\nShe seldom or never looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \"style.\"\\nnot service--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.\\nShe looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear:  \"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I\\'ll-.\"\\nShe did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with.\\nShe resurrected nothing but the cat.\\n\"I never did see the beat of that boy.\"\\nShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and \"jimpso.\"\\nweeds that constituted the garden.\\nNo Tom.\\nSo she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:  \"Y-o-u-u TOM.\"\\nThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.\\n\"There!\\nI might \\'a\\' thought of that closet.\\nWhat you been doing in there?\"\\n\"Nothing.\"\\n\"Nothing!\\nLook at your hands.\\nAnd look at your mouth.\\nWhat _is_ that truck?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know, aunt.\"\\n\"Well, I know.\\nIt\\'s jam--that\\'s what it is.\\nForty times I\\'ve said if you didn\\'t let that jam alone I\\'d skin you.\\nHand me that switch.\"\\nThe switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--  \"My!\\nLook behind you, aunt.\"\\nThe old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.\\nThe lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared over it.\\nHis aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle laugh.\\n\"Hang the boy, can\\'t I never learn anything?\\nAin\\'t he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time?\\nBut old fools is the biggest fools there is.\\nCan\\'t learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is.\\nBut my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what\\'s coming?\\nHe \\'pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it\\'s all down again and I can\\'t hit him a lick.\\nI ain\\'t doing my duty by that boy, and that\\'s the Lord\\'s truth, goodness knows.\\nSpare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says.\\nI\\'m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know.\\nHe\\'s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me!\\nhe\\'s my own dead sister\\'s boy, poor thing, and I ain\\'t got the heart to lash him, somehow.\\nEvery time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks.\\nWell-a-well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it\\'s so.\\nHe\\'ll play hookey this evening, * and [* Southwestern for \"afternoon\"] I\\'ll just be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him.\\nIt\\'s mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he hates anything else, and I\\'ve _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or I\\'ll be the ruination of the child.\"\\nTom did play hookey, and he had a very good time.\\nHe got back home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day\\'s wood and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.\\nTom\\'s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.\\nWhile Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments.\\nLike many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning.\\nSaid she:  \"Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Yes\\'m.\"\\n\"Powerful warm, warn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Yes\\'m.\"\\n\"Didn\\'t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?\"\\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.\\nHe searched Aunt Polly\\'s face, but it told him nothing.\\nSo he said:  \"No\\'m--well, not very much.\"\\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom\\'s shirt, and said:  \"But you ain\\'t too warm now, though.\"\\nAnd it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind.\\nBut in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now.\\nSo he forestalled what might be the next move:  \"Some of us pumped on our heads--mine\\'s damp yet.\\nSee?\"\\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick.\\nThen she had a new inspiration:  \"Tom, you didn\\'t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you?\\nUnbutton your jacket.\"\\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom\\'s face.\\nHe opened his jacket.\\nHis shirt collar was securely sewed.\\n\"Bother!\\nWell, go \\'long with you.\\nI\\'d made sure you\\'d played hookey and been a-swimming.\\nBut I forgive ye, Tom.\\nI reckon you\\'re a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is--better\\'n you look.\\n_This_ time.\"\\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\\nBut Sidney said:  \"Well, now, if I didn\\'t think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it\\'s black.\"\\n\"Why, I did sew it with white!\\nTom.\"\\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest.\\nAs he went out at the door he said:  \"Siddy, I\\'ll lick you for that.\"\\nIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle carried white thread and the other black.\\nHe said:  \"She\\'d never noticed if it hadn\\'t been for Sid.\\nConfound it!\\nsometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black.\\nI wish to gee-miny she\\'d stick to one or t\\'other--I can\\'t keep the run of \\'em.\\nBut I bet you I\\'ll lam Sid for that.\\nI\\'ll learn him.\"\\nHe was not the Model Boy of the village.\\nHe knew the model boy very well though--and loathed him.\\nWithin two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles.\\nNot because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man\\'s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men\\'s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises.\\nThis new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed.\\nIt consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy.\\nDiligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude.\\nHe felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer.\\nThe summer evenings were long.\\nIt was not dark, yet.\\nPresently Tom checked his whistle.\\nA stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger than himself.\\nA new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St.\\nPetersburg.\\nThis boy was well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day.\\nThis was simply as astounding.\\nHis cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons.\\nHe had shoes on--and it was only Friday.\\nHe even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon.\\nHe had a citified air about him that ate into Tom\\'s vitals.\\nThe more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow.\\nNeither boy spoke.\\nIf one moved, the other moved--but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time.\\nFinally Tom said:  \"I can lick you.\"\\n\"I\\'d like to see you try it.\"\\n\"Well, I can do it.\"\\n\"No you can\\'t, either.\"\\n\"Yes I can.\"\\n\"No you can\\'t.\"\\n\"I can.\"\\n\"You can\\'t.\"\\n\"Can.\"\\n\"Can\\'t.\"\\nAn uncomfortable pause.\\nThen Tom said:  \"What\\'s your name?\"\\n\"\\'Tisn\\'t any of your business, maybe.\"\\n\"Well I \\'low I\\'ll _make_ it my business.\"\\n\"Well why don\\'t you?\"\\n\"If you say much, I will.\"\\n\"Much--much--_much_.\\nThere now.\"\\n\"Oh, you think you\\'re mighty smart, _don\\'t_ you?\\nI could lick you with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.\"\\n\"Well why don\\'t you _do_ it?\\nYou _say_ you can do it.\"\\n\"Well I _will_, if you fool with me.\"\\n\"Oh yes--I\\'ve seen whole families in the same fix.\"\\n\"Smarty!\\nYou think you\\'re _some_, now, _don\\'t_ you?\\nOh, what a hat.\"\\n\"You can lump that hat if you don\\'t like it.\\nI dare you to knock it off--and anybody that\\'ll take a dare will suck eggs.\"\\n\"You\\'re a liar.\"\\n\"You\\'re another.\"\\n\"You\\'re a fighting liar and dasn\\'t take it up.\"\\n\"Aw--take a walk.\"\\n\"Say--if you give me much more of your sass I\\'ll take and bounce a rock off\\'n your head.\"\\n\"Oh, of _course_ you will.\"\\n\"Well I _will_.\"\\n\"Well why don\\'t you _do_ it then?\\nWhat do you keep _saying_ you will for?\\nWhy don\\'t you _do_ it?\\nIt\\'s because you\\'re afraid.\"\\n\"I _ain\\'t_ afraid.\"\\n\"You are.\"\\n\"I ain\\'t.\"\\n\"You are.\"\\nAnother pause, and more eying and sidling around each other.\\nPresently they were shoulder to shoulder.\\nTom said:  \"Get away from here.\"\\n\"Go away yourself.\"\\n\"I won\\'t.\"\\n\"I won\\'t either.\"\\nSo they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate.\\nBut neither could get an advantage.\\nAfter struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:  \"You\\'re a coward and a pup.\\nI\\'ll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I\\'ll make him do it, too.\"\\n\"What do I care for your big brother?\\nI\\'ve got a brother that\\'s bigger than he is--and what\\'s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.\"\\n[Both brothers were imaginary.]  \"That\\'s a lie.\"\\n\"_Your_ saying so don\\'t make it so.\"\\nTom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:  \"I dare you to step over that, and I\\'ll lick you till you can\\'t stand up.\\nAnybody that\\'ll take a dare will steal sheep.\"\\nThe new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  \"Now you said you\\'d do it, now let\\'s see you do it.\"\\n\"Don\\'t you crowd me now; you better look out.\"\\n\"Well, you _said_ you\\'d do it--why don\\'t you do it?\"\\n\"By jingo!\\nfor two cents I _will_ do it.\"\\nThe new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision.\\nTom struck them to the ground.\\nIn an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other\\'s hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other\\'s nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory.\\nPresently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists.\\n\"Holler \\'nuff.\"\\nsaid he.\\nThe boy only struggled to free himself.\\nHe was crying--mainly from rage.\\n\"Holler \\'nuff!\"--and the pounding went on.\\nAt last the stranger got out a smothered \"\\'Nuff.\"\\nand Tom let him up and said:  \"Now that\\'ll learn you.\\nBetter look out who you\\'re fooling with next time.\"\\nThe new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the \"next time he caught him out.\"\\nTo which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope.\\nTom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived.\\nHe then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined.\\nAt last the enemy\\'s mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away.\\nSo he went away; but he said he \"\\'lowe.\"\\nto \"la.\"\\nfor that boy.\\nHe got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.\\nThere was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips.\\nThere was cheer in every face and a spring in every step.\\nThe locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air.\\nCardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush.\\nHe surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit.\\nThirty yards of board fence nine feet high.\\nLife to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden.\\nSighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged.\\nJim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals.\\nBringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom\\'s eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so.\\nHe remembered that there was company at the pump.\\nWhite, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking.\\nAnd he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him.\\nTom said:  \"Say, Jim, I\\'ll fetch the water if you\\'ll whitewash some.\"\\nJim shook his head and said:  \"Can\\'t, Mars Tom.\\nOle missis, she tole me I got to go an\\' git dis water an\\' not stop foolin\\' roun\\' wid anybody.\\nShe say she spec\\' Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an\\' so she tole me go \\'long an\\' \\'tend to my own business--she \\'lowed _she\\'d_ \\'tend to de whitewashin\\'.\"\\n\"Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim.\\nThat\\'s the way she always talks.\\nGimme the bucket--I won\\'t be gone only a a minute.\\n_She_ won\\'t ever know.\"\\n\"Oh, I dasn\\'t, Mars Tom.\\nOle missis she\\'d take an\\' tar de head off\\'n me.\\n\\'Deed she would.\"\\n\"_She_!\\nShe never licks anybody--whacks \\'em over the head with her thimble--and who cares for that, I\\'d like to know.\\nShe talks awful, but talk don\\'t hurt--anyways it don\\'t if she don\\'t cry.\\nJim, I\\'ll give you a marvel.\\nI\\'ll give you a white alley.\"\\nJim began to waver.\\n\"White alley, Jim!\\nAnd it\\'s a bully taw.\"\\n\"My!\\nDat\\'s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you!\\nBut Mars Tom I\\'s powerful \\'fraid ole missis-.\"\\n\"And besides, if you will I\\'ll show you my sore toe.\"\\nJim was only human--this attraction was too much for him.\\nHe put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound.\\nIn another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.\\nBut Tom\\'s energy did not last.\\nHe began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied.\\nSoon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work--the very thought of it burnt him like fire.\\nHe got out his worldly wealth and examined it--bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom.\\nSo he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys.\\nAt this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him!\\nNothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration.\\nHe took up his brush and went tranquilly to work.\\nBen Rogers hove in sight presently--the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been dreading.\\nBen\\'s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump--proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high.\\nHe was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat.\\nAs he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance--for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water.\\nHe was boat and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:  \"Stop her, sir!\\nTing-a-ling-ling.\"\\nThe headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.\\n\"Ship up to back!\\nTing-a-ling-ling.\"\\nHis arms straightened and stiffened down his sides.\\n\"Set her back on the stabboard!\\nTing-a-ling-ling!\\nChow!\\nch-chow-wow!\\nChow.\"\\nHis right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles--for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.\\n\"Let her go back on the labboard!\\nTing-a-ling-ling!\\nChow-ch-chow-chow.\"\\nThe left hand began to describe circles.\\n\"Stop the stabboard!\\nTing-a-ling-ling!\\nStop the labboard!\\nCome ahead on the stabboard!\\nStop her!\\nLet your outside turn over slow!\\nTing-a-ling-ling!\\nChow-ow-ow!\\nGet out that head-line!\\n_lively_ now!\\nCome--out with your spring-line--what\\'re you about there!\\nTake a turn round that stump with the bight of it!\\nStand by that stage, now--let her go!\\nDone with the engines, sir!\\nTing-a-ling-ling!\\nSH\\'T!\\nS\\'H\\'T!\\nSH\\'T.\"\\n(trying the gauge-cocks).\\nTom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamboat.\\nBen stared a moment and then said: \"_Hi-Yi!\\nYou\\'re_ up a stump, ain\\'t you.\"\\nNo answer.\\nTom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before.\\nBen ranged up alongside of him.\\nTom\\'s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work.\\nBen said:  \"Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\"\\nTom wheeled suddenly and said:  \"Why, it\\'s you, Ben!\\nI warn\\'t noticing.\"\\n\"Say--I\\'m going in a-swimming, I am.\\nDon\\'t you wish you could?\\nBut of course you\\'d druther _work_--wouldn\\'t you?\\nCourse you would.\"\\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:  \"What do you call work?\"\\n\"Why, ain\\'t _that_ work?\"\\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:  \"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain\\'t.\\nAll I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\"\\n\"Oh come, now, you don\\'t mean to let on that you _like_ it?\"\\nThe brush continued to move.\\n\"Like it?\\nWell, I don\\'t see why I oughtn\\'t to like it.\\nDoes a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\"\\nThat put the thing in a new light.\\nBen stopped nibbling his apple.\\nTom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the effect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed.\\nPresently he said:  \"Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.\"\\nTom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:  \"No--no--I reckon it wouldn\\'t hardly do, Ben.\\nYou see, Aunt Polly\\'s awful particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it was the back fence I wouldn\\'t mind and _she_ wouldn\\'t.\\nYes, she\\'s awful particular about this fence; it\\'s got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain\\'t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it\\'s got to be done.\"\\n\"No--is that so?\\nOh come, now--lemme just try.\\nOnly just a little--I\\'d let _you_, if you was me, Tom.\"\\n\"Ben, I\\'d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn\\'t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn\\'t let Sid.\\nNow don\\'t you see how I\\'m fixed?\\nIf you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it-.\"\\n\"Oh, shucks, I\\'ll be just as careful.\\nNow lemme try.\\nSay--I\\'ll give you the core of my apple.\"\\n\"Well, here--No, Ben, now don\\'t.\\nI\\'m afeard-.\"\\n\"I\\'ll give you _all_ of it.\"\\nTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his heart.\\nAnd while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents.\\nThere was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash.\\nBy the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on, hour after hour.\\nAnd when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth.\\nHe had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn\\'t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a dog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.\\nHe had had a nice, good, idle time all the while--plenty of company--and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it!\\nIf he hadn\\'t run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.\\nTom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all.\\nHe had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it--namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.\\nIf he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.\\nAnd this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement.\\nThere are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.\\nThe boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to report.\\nThe balmy summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting--for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap.\\nHer spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety.\\nShe had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way.\\nHe said: \"Mayn\\'t I go and play now, aunt?\"\\n\"What, a\\'ready?\\nHow much have you done?\"\\n\"It\\'s all done, aunt.\"\\n\"Tom, don\\'t lie to me--I can\\'t bear it.\"\\n\"I ain\\'t, aunt; it _is_ all done.\"\\nAunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence.\\nShe went out to see for herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent.\\nof Tom\\'s statement true.\\nWhen she found the entire fence white-washed, and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable.\\nShe said:  \"Well, I never!\\nThere\\'s no getting round it, you can work when you\\'re a mind to, Tom.\"\\nAnd then she diluted the compliment by adding, \"But it\\'s powerful seldom you\\'re a mind to, I\\'m bound to say.\\nWell, go \\'long and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I\\'ll tan you.\"\\nShe was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.\\nAnd while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he \"hooke.\"\\na doughnut.\\nThen he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor.\\nClods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling.\\nThey raged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone.\\nThere was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it.\\nHis soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble.\\nTom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt\\'s cow-stable.\\nHe presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two \"militar.\"\\ncompanies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment.\\nTom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other.\\nThese two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being better suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp.\\nTom\\'s army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle.\\nThen the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.\\nAs he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden--a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered pan-talettes.\\nThe fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot.\\nA certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind.\\nHe had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality.\\nHe had been months winning her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.\\nHe worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to \"show of.\"\\nin all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration.\\nHe kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house.\\nTom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer.\\nShe halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door.\\nTom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold.\\nBut his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.\\nThe boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.\\nPresently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner.\\nBut only for a minute--only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart--or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.\\nHe returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, \"showing off.\"\\nas before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions.\\nFinally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.\\nAll through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered \"what had got into the child.\"\\nHe took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least.\\nHe tried to steal sugar under his aunt\\'s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it.\\nHe said:  \"Aunt, you don\\'t whack Sid when he takes it.\"\\n\"Well, Sid don\\'t torment a body the way you do.\\nYou\\'d be always into that sugar if I warn\\'t watching you.\"\\nPresently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl--a sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable.\\nBut Sid\\'s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke.\\nTom was in ecstasies.\\nIn such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent.\\nHe said to himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model \"catch it.\"\\nHe was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles.\\nHe said to himself, \"Now it\\'s coming.\"\\nAnd the next instant he was sprawling on the floor!\\nThe potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:  \"Hold on, now, what \\'er you belting _me_ for?--Sid broke it.\"\\nAunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity.\\nBut when she got her tongue again, she only said:  \"Umf!\\nWell, you didn\\'t get a lick amiss, I reckon.\\nYou been into some other audacious mischief when I wasn\\'t around, like enough.\"\\nThen her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.\\nSo she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.\\nTom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes.\\nHe knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it.\\nHe would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none.\\nHe knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it.\\nHe pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid.\\nAh, how would she feel then?\\nAnd he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest.\\nHow she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more!\\nBut he would lie there cold and white and make no sign--a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end.\\nHe so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose.\\nAnd such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.\\nHe wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit.\\nA log raft in the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature.\\nThen he thought of his flower.\\nHe got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal felicity.\\nHe wondered if she would pity him if she knew?\\nWould she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him?\\nOr would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?\\nThis picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till he wore it threadbare.\\nAt last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.\\nAbout half-past nine or ten o\\'clock he came along the deserted street to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second-story window.\\nWas the sacred presence there?\\nHe climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.\\nAnd thus he would die--out in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came.\\nAnd thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and oh!\\nwould she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?\\nThe window went up, a maid-servant\\'s discordant voice profaned the holy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr\\'s remains!\\nThe strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort.\\nThere was a whiz as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom.\\nNot long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he had any dim idea of making any \"references to allusions.\"\\nhe thought better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom\\'s eye.\\nTom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental note of the omission.\\nBreakfast over, Aunt Polly had family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\\nThen Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to \"get his verses.\"\\nSid had learned his lesson days before.\\nTom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.\\nAt the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations.\\nMary took his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the fog:  \"Blessed are the--a--a-.\"\\n\"Poor\"--  \"Yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a-.\"\\n\"In spirit-.\"\\n\"In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they-.\"\\n\"_Theirs_-.\"\\n\"For _theirs_.\\nBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\nBlessed are they that mourn, for they--they-.\"\\n\"Sh-.\"\\n\"For they--a-.\"\\n\"S, H, A-.\"\\n\"For they S, H--Oh, I don\\'t know what it is.\"\\n\"_Shall_.\"\\n\"Oh, _shall_!\\nfor they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--blessed are they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for they shall--a--shall _what_?\\nWhy don\\'t you tell me, Mary?--what do you want to be so mean for?\"\\n\"Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I\\'m not teasing you.\\nI wouldn\\'t do that.\\nYou must go and learn it again.\\nDon\\'t you be discouraged, Tom, you\\'ll manage it--and if you do, I\\'ll give you something ever so nice.\\nThere, now, that\\'s a good boy.\"\\n\"All right!\\nWhat is it, Mary, tell me what it is.\"\\n\"Never you mind, Tom.\\nYou know if I say it\\'s nice, it is nice.\"\\n\"You bet you that\\'s so, Mary.\\nAll right, I\\'ll tackle it again.\"\\nAnd he did \"tackle it again\"--and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success.\\nMary gave him a brand-new \"Barlo.\"\\nknife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations.\\nTrue, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a \"sure-enoug.\"\\nBarlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that--though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps.\\nTom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.\\nMary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door.\\nBut Mary removed the towel and said:  \"Now ain\\'t you ashamed, Tom.\\nYou mustn\\'t be so bad.\\nWater won\\'t hurt you.\"\\nTom was a trifle disconcerted.\\nThe basin was refilled, and this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began.\\nWhen he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face.\\nBut when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck.\\nMary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect.\\n[He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they were simply called his \"other clothes\"--and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe.\\nThe girl \"put him to right.\"\\nafter he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat.\\nHe now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable.\\nHe was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him.\\nHe hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out.\\nHe lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn\\'t want to do.\\nBut Mary said, persuasively:  \"Please, Tom--that\\'s a good boy.\"\\nSo he got into the shoes snarling.\\nMary was soon ready, and the three children set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.\\nSabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church service.\\nTwo of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too--for stronger reasons.\\nThe church\\'s high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple.\\nAt the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:  \"Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"What\\'ll you take for her?\"\\n\"What\\'ll you give?\"\\n\"Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.\"\\n\"Less see \\'em.\"\\nTom exhibited.\\nThey were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.\\nThen Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones.\\nHe waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer.\\nHe entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy.\\nThe teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy\\'s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say \"Ouch.\"\\nand got a new reprimand from his teacher.\\nTom\\'s whole class were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome.\\nWhen they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along.\\nHowever, they worried through, and each got his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation.\\nTen blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil.\\nHow many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible?\\nAnd yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it was the patient work of two years--and a boy of German parentage had won four or five.\\nHe once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth--a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out and \"spread himself.\"\\nOnly the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar\\'s heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks.\\nIt is possible that Tom\\'s mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.\\nIn due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention.\\nWhen a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert--though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer.\\nThis superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth--a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together.\\nMr.\\nWalters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days.\\nHe began after this fashion:  \"Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two.\\nThere--that is it.\\nThat is the way good little boys and girls should do.\\nI see one little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds.\\n[Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.\"\\nAnd so forth and so on.\\nIt is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration.\\nIt was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\\nThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary.\\nBut now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr.\\nWalters\\' voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\\nA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter\\'s wife.\\nThe lady was leading a child.\\nTom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could not meet Amy Lawrence\\'s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze.\\nBut when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment.\\nThe next moment he was \"showing of.\"\\nwith all his might--cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces--in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause.\\nHis exaltation had but one alloy--the memory of his humiliation in this angel\\'s garden--and that record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.\\nThe visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.\\nWalters\\' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school.\\nThe middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one than the county judge--altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material he was made of--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might, too.\\nHe was from Constantinople, twelve miles away--so he had travelled, and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house--which was said to have a tin roof.\\nThe awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes.\\nThis was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer.\\nJeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school.\\nIt would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:  \"Look at him, Jim!\\nHe\\'s a going up there.\\nSay--look!\\nhe\\'s a going to shake hands with him--he _is_ shaking hands with him!\\nBy jings, don\\'t you wish you was Jeff?\"\\nMr.\\nWalters fell to \"showing off.\"\\nwith all sorts of official bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target.\\nThe librarian \"showed off\"--running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in.\\nThe young lady teachers \"showed off\"--bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly.\\nThe young gentlemen teachers \"showed of.\"\\nwith small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline--and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation).\\nThe little girls \"showed of.\"\\nin various ways, and the little boys \"showed of.\"\\nwith such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings.\\nAnd above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was \"showing off.\"\\ntoo.\\nThere was only one thing wanting to make Mr.\\nWalters\\' ecstasy complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.\\nSeveral pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been around among the star pupils inquiring.\\nHe would have given worlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.\\nAnd now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible.\\nThis was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.\\nWalters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years.\\nBut there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face.\\nTom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters.\\nIt was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one\\'s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one.\\nThe boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.\\nThese despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.\\nThe prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow\\'s instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.\\nAmy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in her face--but he wouldn\\'t look.\\nShe wondered; then she was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched; a furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody.\\nTom most of all (she thought).\\nTom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath would hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the awful greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent.\\nHe would have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark.\\nThe Judge put his hand on Tom\\'s head and called him a fine little man, and asked him what his name was.\\nThe boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:  \"Tom.\"\\n\"Oh, no, not Tom--it is-.\"\\n\"Thomas.\"\\n\"Ah, that\\'s it.\\nI thought there was more to it, maybe.\\nThat\\'s very well.\\nBut you\\'ve another one I daresay, and you\\'ll tell it to me, won\\'t you?\"\\n\"Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas.\"\\nsaid Walters, \"and say sir.\\nYou mustn\\'t forget your manners.\"\\n\"Thomas Sawyer--sir.\"\\n\"That\\'s it!\\nThat\\'s a good boy.\\nFine boy.\\nFine, manly little fellow.\\nTwo thousand verses is a great many--very, very great many.\\nAnd you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world; it\\'s what makes great men and good men; you\\'ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you\\'ll look back and say, It\\'s all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood--it\\'s all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn--it\\'s all owing to the good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible--a splendid elegant Bible--to keep and have it all for my own, always--it\\'s all owing to right bringing up!\\nThat is what you will say, Thomas--and you wouldn\\'t take any money for those two thousand verses--no indeed you wouldn\\'t.\\nAnd now you wouldn\\'t mind telling me and this lady some of the things you\\'ve learned--no, I know you wouldn\\'t--for we are proud of little boys that learn.\\nNow, no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples.\\nWon\\'t you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed?\"\\nTom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish.\\nHe blushed, now, and his eyes fell.\\nMr.\\nWalters\\' heart sank within him.\\nHe said to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question--why _did_ the Judge ask him?\\nYet he felt obliged to speak up and say:  \"Answer the gentleman, Thomas--don\\'t be afraid.\"\\nTom still hung fire.\\n\"Now I know you\\'ll tell me.\"\\nsaid the lady.\\n\"The names of the first two disciples were-.\"\\n\"_David And Goliah!.\"\\nLet us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.\\nThe Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision.\\nAunt Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed next the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible.\\nThe crowd filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair, smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St.\\nPetersburg could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs.\\nWard; lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a body--for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass.\\nHe always brought his mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons.\\nThe boys all hated him, he was so good.\\nAnd besides, he had been \"thrown up to the.\"\\nso much.\\nHis white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on Sundays--accidentally.\\nTom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys who had as snobs.\\nThe congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery.\\nThe choir always tittered and whispered all through service.\\nThere was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now.\\nIt was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.\\nThe minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country.\\nHis voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow\\'ry _beds_ of ease,  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro\\' _blood_-y seas?\\nHe was regarded as a wonderful reader.\\nAt church \"sociable.\"\\nhe was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and \"wal.\"\\ntheir eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, \"Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal earth.\"\\nAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev.\\nMr.\\nSprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and read off \"notice.\"\\nof meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers.\\nOften, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.\\nAnd now the minister prayed.\\nA good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a grateful harvest of good.\\nAmen.\\nThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.\\nThe boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it--if he even did that much.\\nHe was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously--for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman\\'s regular route over it--and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly.\\nIn the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe.\\nAs indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom\\'s hands itched to grab for it they did not dare--he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on.\\nBut with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the \"Ame.\"\\nwas out the fly was a prisoner of war.\\nHis aunt detected the act and made him let it go.\\nThe minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving.\\nTom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse.\\nHowever, this time he was really interested for a little while.\\nThe minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world\\'s hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them.\\nBut the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.\\nNow he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.\\nPresently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out.\\nIt was a large black beetle with formidable jaws--a \"pinchbug.\"\\nhe called it.\\nIt was in a percussion-cap box.\\nThe first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger.\\nA natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy\\'s mouth.\\nThe beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over.\\nTom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach.\\nOther people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too.\\nPresently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change.\\nHe spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged.\\nHe surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded.\\nHis head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it.\\nThere was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle\\'s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more.\\nThe neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy.\\nThe dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge.\\nSo he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again.\\nBut he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it.\\nThen there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light.\\nAt last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master\\'s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.\\nBy this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.\\nThe discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing.\\nIt was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.\\nTom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it.\\nHe had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.\\nMonday morning always found him so--because it began another week\\'s slow suffering in school.\\nHe generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.\\nTom lay thinking.\\nPresently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he could stay home from school.\\nHere was a vague possibility.\\nHe canvassed his system.\\nNo ailment was found, and he investigated again.\\nThis time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope.\\nBut they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away.\\nHe reflected further.\\nSuddenly he discovered something.\\nOne of his upper front teeth was loose.\\nThis was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a \"starter.\"\\nas he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt.\\nSo he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.\\nNothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger.\\nSo the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.\\nBut now he did not know the necessary symptoms.\\nHowever, it seemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.\\nBut Sid slept on unconscious.\\nTom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.\\nNo result from Sid.\\nTom was panting with his exertions by this time.\\nHe took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.\\nSid snored on.\\nTom was aggravated.\\nHe said, \"Sid, Sid.\"\\nand shook him.\\nThis course worked well, and Tom began to groan again.\\nSid yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.\\nTom went on groaning.\\nSid said:  \"Tom!\\nSay, Tom.\"\\n[No response.] \"Here, Tom!\\nTOM!\\nWhat is the matter, Tom?\"\\nAnd he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.\\nTom moaned out:  \"Oh, don\\'t, Sid.\\nDon\\'t joggle me.\"\\n\"Why, what\\'s the matter, Tom?\\nI must call auntie.\"\\n\"No--never mind.\\nIt\\'ll be over by and by, maybe.\\nDon\\'t call anybody.\"\\n\"But I must!\\n_Don\\'t_ groan so, Tom, it\\'s awful.\\nHow long you been this way?\"\\n\"Hours.\\nOuch!\\nOh, don\\'t stir so, Sid, you\\'ll kill me.\"\\n\"Tom, why didn\\'t you wake me sooner?\\nOh, Tom, _don\\'t!_ It makes my flesh crawl to hear you.\\nTom, what is the matter?\"\\n\"I forgive you everything, Sid.\\n[Groan.] Everything you\\'ve ever done to me.\\nWhen I\\'m gone-.\"\\n\"Oh, Tom, you ain\\'t dying, are you?\\nDon\\'t, Tom--oh, don\\'t.\\nMaybe-.\"\\n\"I forgive everybody, Sid.\\n[Groan.] Tell \\'em so, Sid.\\nAnd Sid, you give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that\\'s come to town, and tell her-.\"\\nBut Sid had snatched his clothes and gone.\\nTom was suffering in reality, now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone.\\nSid flew downstairs and said:  \"Oh, Aunt Polly, come!\\nTom\\'s dying.\"\\n\"Dying.\"\\n\"Yes\\'m.\\nDon\\'t wait--come quick.\"\\n\"Rubbage!\\nI don\\'t believe it.\"\\nBut she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.\\nAnd her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled.\\nWhen she reached the bedside she gasped out:  \"You, Tom!\\nTom, what\\'s the matter with you?\"\\n\"Oh, auntie, I\\'m-.\"\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?\"\\n\"Oh, auntie, my sore toe\\'s mortified.\"\\nThe old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a little, then did both together.\\nThis restored her and she said:  \"Tom, what a turn you did give me.\\nNow you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this.\"\\nThe groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe.\\nThe boy felt a little foolish, and he said:  \"Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all.\"\\n\"Your tooth, indeed!\\nWhat\\'s the matter with your tooth?\"\\n\"One of them\\'s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.\"\\n\"There, there, now, don\\'t begin that groaning again.\\nOpen your mouth.\\nWell--your tooth _is_ loose, but you\\'re not going to die about that.\\nMary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.\"\\nTom said:  \"Oh, please, auntie, don\\'t pull it out.\\nIt don\\'t hurt any more.\\nI wish I may never stir if it does.\\nPlease don\\'t, auntie.\\nI don\\'t want to stay home from school.\"\\n\"Oh, you don\\'t, don\\'t you?\\nSo all this row was because you thought you\\'d get to stay home from school and go a-fishing?\\nTom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness.\"\\nBy this time the dental instruments were ready.\\nThe old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom\\'s tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost.\\nThen she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy\\'s face.\\nThe tooth hung dangling by the bedpost, now.\\nBut all trials bring their compensations.\\nAs Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way.\\nHe gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory.\\nHis heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn\\'t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, \"Sour grapes.\"\\nand he wandered away a dismantled hero.\\nShortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard.\\nHuckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad--and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him.\\nTom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play with him.\\nSo he played with him every time he got a chance.\\nHuckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags.\\nHis hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.\\nHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will.\\nHe slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully.\\nIn a word, everything that goes to make life precious that boy had.\\nSo thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St.\\nPetersburg.\\nTom hailed the romantic outcast:  \"Hello, Huckleberry.\"\\n\"Hello yourself, and see how you like it.\"\\n\"What\\'s that you got?\"\\n\"Dead cat.\"\\n\"Lemme see him, Huck.\\nMy, he\\'s pretty stiff.\\nWhere\\'d you get him?\"\\n\"Bought him off\\'n a boy.\"\\n\"What did you give?\"\\n\"I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.\"\\n\"Where\\'d you get the blue ticket?\"\\n\"Bought it off\\'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.\"\\n\"Say--what is dead cats good for, Huck?\"\\n\"Good for?\\nCure warts with.\"\\n\"No!\\nIs that so?\\nI know something that\\'s better.\"\\n\"I bet you don\\'t.\\nWhat is it?\"\\n\"Why, spunk-water.\"\\n\"Spunk-water!\\nI wouldn\\'t give a dern for spunk-water.\"\\n\"You wouldn\\'t, wouldn\\'t you?\\nD\\'you ever try it?\"\\n\"No, I hain\\'t.\\nBut Bob Tanner did.\"\\n\"Who told you so.\"\\n\"Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me.\\nThere now.\"\\n\"Well, what of it?\\nThey\\'ll all lie.\\nLeastways all but the nigger.\\nI don\\'t know _him_.\\nBut I never see a nigger that _wouldn\\'t_ lie.\\nShucks!\\nNow you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.\"\\n\"Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.\"\\n\"In the daytime?\"\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\"With his face to the stump?\"\\n\"Yes.\\nLeast I reckon so.\"\\n\"Did he say anything?\"\\n\"I don\\'t reckon he did.\\nI don\\'t know.\"\\n\"Aha!\\nTalk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that!\\nWhy, that ain\\'t a-going to do any good.\\nYou got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there\\'s a spunk-water stump, and just as it\\'s midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:  \\'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,\\'\\nand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.\\nBecause if you speak the charm\\'s busted.\"\\n\"Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain\\'t the way Bob Tanner done.\"\\n\"No, sir, you can bet he didn\\'t, becuz he\\'s the wartiest boy in this town; and he wouldn\\'t have a wart on him if he\\'d knowed how to work spunk-water.\\nI\\'ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck.\\nI play with frogs so much that I\\'ve always got considerable many warts.\\nSometimes I take \\'em off with a bean.\"\\n\"Yes, bean\\'s good.\\nI\\'ve done that.\"\\n\"Have you?\\nWhat\\'s your way?\"\\n\"You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it \\'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean.\\nYou see that piece that\\'s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes.\"\\n\"Yes, that\\'s it, Huck--that\\'s it; though when you\\'re burying it if you say \\'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!\\' it\\'s better.\\nThat\\'s the way Joe Harper does, and he\\'s been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres.\\nBut say--how do you cure \\'em with dead cats?\"\\n\"Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard \\'long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it\\'s midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can\\'t see \\'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear \\'em talk; and when they\\'re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after \\'em and say, \\'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I\\'m done with ye!\\' That\\'ll fetch _any_ wart.\"\\n\"Sounds right.\\nD\\'you ever try it, Huck?\"\\n\"No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.\"\\n\"Well, I reckon it\\'s so, then.\\nBecuz they say she\\'s a witch.\"\\n\"Say!\\nWhy, Tom, I _know_ she is.\\nShe witched pap.\\nPap says so his own self.\\nHe come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn\\'t dodged, he\\'d a got her.\\nWell, that very night he rolled off\\'n a shed wher\\' he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.\"\\n\"Why, that\\'s awful.\\nHow did he know she was a-witching him?\"\\n\"Lord, pap can tell, easy.\\nPap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, they\\'re a-witching you.\\nSpecially if they mumble.\\nBecuz when they mumble they\\'re saying the Lord\\'s Prayer backards.\"\\n\"Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?\"\\n\"To-night.\\nI reckon they\\'ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.\"\\n\"But they buried him Saturday.\\nDidn\\'t they get him Saturday night?\"\\n\"Why, how you talk!\\nHow could their charms work till midnight?--and _then_ it\\'s Sunday.\\nDevils don\\'t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don\\'t reckon.\"\\n\"I never thought of that.\\nThat\\'s so.\\nLemme go with you?\"\\n\"Of course--if you ain\\'t afeard.\"\\n\"Afeard!\\n\\'Tain\\'t likely.\\nWill you meow?\"\\n\"Yes--and you meow back, if you get a chance.\\nLast time, you kep\\' me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says \\'Dern that cat!\\' and so I hove a brick through his window--but don\\'t you tell.\"\\n\"I won\\'t.\\nI couldn\\'t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I\\'ll meow this time.\\nSay--what\\'s that?\"\\n\"Nothing but a tick.\"\\n\"Where\\'d you get him?\"\\n\"Out in the woods.\"\\n\"What\\'ll you take for him?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\\nI don\\'t want to sell him.\"\\n\"All right.\\nIt\\'s a mighty small tick, anyway.\"\\n\"Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don\\'t belong to them.\\nI\\'m satisfied with it.\\nIt\\'s a good enough tick for me.\"\\n\"Sho, there\\'s ticks a plenty.\\nI could have a thousand of \\'em if I wanted to.\"\\n\"Well, why don\\'t you?\\nBecuz you know mighty well you can\\'t.\\nThis is a pretty early tick, I reckon.\\nIt\\'s the first one I\\'ve seen this year.\"\\n\"Say, Huck--I\\'ll give you my tooth for him.\"\\n\"Less see it.\"\\nTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it.\\nHuckleberry viewed it wistfully.\\nThe temptation was very strong.\\nAt last he said:  \"Is it genuwyne?\"\\nTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.\\n\"Well, all right.\"\\nsaid Huckleberry, \"it\\'s a trade.\"\\nTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the pinchbug\\'s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than before.\\nWhen Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed.\\nHe hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like alacrity.\\nThe master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study.\\nThe interruption roused him.\\n\"Thomas Sawyer.\"\\nTom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.\\n\"Sir.\"\\n\"Come up here.\\nNow, sir, why are you late again, as usual?\"\\nTom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the girls\\' side of the school-house.\\nHe instantly said:  \"_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!.\"\\nThe master\\'s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly.\\nThe buzz of study ceased.\\nThe pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind.\\nThe master said:  \"You--you did what?\"\\n\"Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.\"\\nThere was no mistaking the words.\\n\"Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to.\\nNo mere ferule will answer for this offence.\\nTake off your jacket.\"\\nThe master\\'s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished.\\nThen the order followed:  \"Now, sir, go and sit with the girls!\\nAnd let this be a warning to you.\"\\nThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune.\\nHe sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head.\\nNudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\\nBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more.\\nPresently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl.\\nShe observed it, \"made a mout.\"\\nat him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute.\\nWhen she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her.\\nShe thrust it away.\\nTom gently put it back.\\nShe thrust it away again, but with less animosity.\\nTom patiently returned it to its place.\\nThen she let it remain.\\nTom scrawled on his slate, \"Please take it--I got more.\"\\nThe girl glanced at the words, but made no sign.\\nNow the boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand.\\nFor a time the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs.\\nThe boy worked on, apparently unconscious.\\nThe girl made a sort of non-committal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it.\\nAt last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:  \"Let me see it.\"\\nTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney.\\nThen the girl\\'s interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else.\\nWhen it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:  \"It\\'s nice--make a man.\"\\nThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick.\\nHe could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:  \"It\\'s a beautiful man--now make me coming along.\"\\nTom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan.\\nThe girl said:  \"It\\'s ever so nice--I wish I could draw.\"\\n\"It\\'s easy.\"\\nwhispered Tom, \"I\\'ll learn you.\"\\n\"Oh, will you?\\nWhen?\"\\n\"At noon.\\nDo you go home to dinner?\"\\n\"I\\'ll stay if you will.\"\\n\"Good--that\\'s a whack.\\nWhat\\'s your name?\"\\n\"Becky Thatcher.\\nWhat\\'s yours?\\nOh, I know.\\nIt\\'s Thomas Sawyer.\"\\n\"That\\'s the name they lick me by.\\nI\\'m Tom when I\\'m good.\\nYou call me Tom, will you?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nNow Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the girl.\\nBut she was not backward this time.\\nShe begged to see.\\nTom said:  \"Oh, it ain\\'t anything.\"\\n\"Yes it is.\"\\n\"No it ain\\'t.\\nYou don\\'t want to see.\"\\n\"Yes I do, indeed I do.\\nPlease let me.\"\\n\"You\\'ll tell.\"\\n\"No I won\\'t--deed and deed and double deed won\\'t.\"\\n\"You won\\'t tell anybody at all?\\nEver, as long as you live?\"\\n\"No, I won\\'t ever tell _any_body.\\nNow let me.\"\\n\"Oh, _you_ don\\'t want to see.\"\\n\"Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.\"\\nAnd she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed: \"_I love you_.\"\\n\"Oh, you bad thing.\"\\nAnd she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.\\nJust at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a steady lifting impulse.\\nIn that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school.\\nThen the master stood over him during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word.\\nBut although Tom\\'s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.\\nAs the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the turmoil within him was too great.\\nIn turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and got \"turned down.\"\\nby a succession of mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.\\nSo at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up.\\nIt seemed to him that the noon recess would never come.\\nThe air was utterly dead.\\nThere was not a breath stirring.\\nIt was the sleepiest of sleepy days.\\nThe drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees.\\nAway off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep.\\nTom\\'s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.\\nHis hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it.\\nThen furtively the percussion-cap box came out.\\nHe released the tick and put him on the long flat desk.\\nThe creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.\\nTom\\'s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant.\\nThis bosom friend was Joe Harper.\\nThe two boys were sworn friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays.\\nJoe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.\\nThe sport grew in interest momently.\\nSoon Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick.\\nSo he put Joe\\'s slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.\\n\"Now.\"\\nsaid he, \"as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I\\'ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side, you\\'re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.\"\\n\"All right, go ahead; start him up.\"\\nThe tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator.\\nJoe harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again.\\nThis change of base occurred often.\\nWhile one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else.\\nAt last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe.\\nThe tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom\\'s fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe\\'s pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession.\\nAt last Tom could stand it no longer.\\nThe temptation was too strong.\\nSo he reached out and lent a hand with his pin.\\nJoe was angry in a moment.\\nSaid he:  \"Tom, you let him alone.\"\\n\"I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.\"\\n\"No, sir, it ain\\'t fair; you just let him alone.\"\\n\"Blame it, I ain\\'t going to stir him much.\"\\n\"Let him alone, I tell you.\"\\n\"I won\\'t.\"\\n\"You shall--he\\'s on my side of the line.\"\\n\"Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?\"\\n\"I don\\'t care whose tick he is--he\\'s on my side of the line, and you sha\\'n\\'t touch him.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ll just bet I will, though.\\nHe\\'s my tick and I\\'ll do what I blame please with him, or die.\"\\nA tremendous whack came down on Tom\\'s shoulders, and its duplicate on Joe\\'s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it.\\nThe boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.\\nHe had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it.\\nWhen school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered in her ear:  \"Put on your bonnet and let on you\\'re going home; and when you get to the corner, give the rest of \\'em the slip, and turn down through the lane and come back.\\nI\\'ll go the other way and come it over \\'em the same way.\"\\nSo the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with another.\\nIn a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves.\\nThen they sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising house.\\nWhen the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.\\nTom was swimming in bliss.\\nHe said:  \"Do you love rats?\"\\n\"No!\\nI hate them.\"\\n\"Well, I do, too--_live_ ones.\\nBut I mean dead ones, to swing round your head with a string.\"\\n\"No, I don\\'t care for rats much, anyway.\\nWhat I like is chewing-gum.\"\\n\"Oh, I should say so!\\nI wish I had some now.\"\\n\"Do you?\\nI\\'ve got some.\\nI\\'ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it back to me.\"\\nThat was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.\\n\"Was you ever at a circus?\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"Yes, and my pa\\'s going to take me again some time, if I\\'m good.\"\\n\"I been to the circus three or four times--lots of times.\\nChurch ain\\'t shucks to a circus.\\nThere\\'s things going on at a circus all the time.\\nI\\'m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.\"\\n\"Oh, are you!\\nThat will be nice.\\nThey\\'re so lovely, all spotted up.\"\\n\"Yes, that\\'s so.\\nAnd they get slathers of money--most a dollar a day, Ben Rogers says.\\nSay, Becky, was you ever engaged?\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\"Why, engaged to be married.\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Would you like to?\"\\n\"I reckon so.\\nI don\\'t know.\\nWhat is it like?\"\\n\"Like?\\nWhy it ain\\'t like anything.\\nYou only just tell a boy you won\\'t ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that\\'s all.\\nAnybody can do it.\"\\n\"Kiss?\\nWhat do you kiss for?\"\\n\"Why, that, you know, is to--well, they always do that.\"\\n\"Everybody?\"\\n\"Why, yes, everybody that\\'s in love with each other.\\nDo you remember what I wrote on the slate?\"\\n\"Ye--yes.\"\\n\"What was it?\"\\n\"I sha\\'n\\'t tell you.\"\\n\"Shall I tell _you_?\"\\n\"Ye--yes--but some other time.\"\\n\"No, now.\"\\n\"No, not now--to-morrow.\"\\n\"Oh, no, _now_.\\nPlease, Becky--I\\'ll whisper it, I\\'ll whisper it ever so easy.\"\\nBecky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her ear.\\nAnd then he added:  \"Now you whisper it to me--just the same.\"\\nShe resisted, for a while, and then said:  \"You turn your face away so you can\\'t see, and then I will.\\nBut you mustn\\'t ever tell anybody--_will_ you, Tom?\\nNow you won\\'t, _will_ you?\"\\n\"No, indeed, indeed I won\\'t.\\nNow, Becky.\"\\nHe turned his face away.\\nShe bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered, \"I--love--you.\"\\nThen she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches, with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little white apron to her face.\\nTom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:  \"Now, Becky, it\\'s all done--all over but the kiss.\\nDon\\'t you be afraid of that--it ain\\'t anything at all.\\nPlease, Becky.\"\\nAnd he tugged at her apron and the hands.\\nBy and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted.\\nTom kissed the red lips and said:  \"Now it\\'s all done, Becky.\\nAnd always after this, you know, you ain\\'t ever to love anybody but me, and you ain\\'t ever to marry anybody but me, ever never and forever.\\nWill you?\"\\n\"No, I\\'ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I\\'ll never marry anybody but you--and you ain\\'t to ever marry anybody but me, either.\"\\n\"Certainly.\\nOf course.\\nThat\\'s _part_ of it.\\nAnd always coming to school or when we\\'re going home, you\\'re to walk with me, when there ain\\'t anybody looking--and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that\\'s the way you do when you\\'re engaged.\"\\n\"It\\'s so nice.\\nI never heard of it before.\"\\n\"Oh, it\\'s ever so gay!\\nWhy, me and Amy Lawrence-.\"\\nThe big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.\\n\"Oh, Tom!\\nThen I ain\\'t the first you\\'ve ever been engaged to.\"\\nThe child began to cry.\\nTom said:  \"Oh, don\\'t cry, Becky, I don\\'t care for her any more.\"\\n\"Yes, you do, Tom--you know you do.\"\\nTom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and turned her face to the wall, and went on crying.\\nTom tried again, with soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again.\\nThen his pride was up, and he strode away and went outside.\\nHe stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping she would repent and come to find him.\\nBut she did not.\\nThen he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong.\\nIt was a hard struggle with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and entered.\\nShe was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with her face to the wall.\\nTom\\'s heart smote him.\\nHe went to her and stood a moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed.\\nThen he said hesitatingly:  \"Becky, I--I don\\'t care for anybody but you.\"\\nNo reply--but sobs.\\n\"Becky\"--pleadingly.\\n\"Becky, won\\'t you say something?\"\\nMore sobs.\\nTom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:  \"Please, Becky, won\\'t you take it?\"\\nShe struck it to the floor.\\nThen Tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day.\\nPresently Becky began to suspect.\\nShe ran to the door; he was not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there.\\nThen she called:  \"Tom!\\nCome back, Tom.\"\\nShe listened intently, but there was no answer.\\nShe had no companions but silence and loneliness.\\nSo she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.\\nHe crossed a small \"branc.\"\\ntwo or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit.\\nHalf an hour later he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him.\\nHe entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.\\nThere was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound.\\nThe boy\\'s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings.\\nHe sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating.\\nIt seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more.\\nIf he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with it all.\\nNow as to this girl.\\nWhat had he done?\\nNothing.\\nHe had meant the best in the world, and been treated like a dog--like a very dog.\\nShe would be sorry some day--maybe when it was too late.\\nAh, if he could only die _temporarily_!\\nBut the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time.\\nTom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again.\\nWhat if he turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously?\\nWhat if he went away--ever so far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas--and never came back any more!\\nHow would she feel then!\\nThe idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only to fill him with disgust.\\nFor frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic.\\nNo, he would be a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.\\nNo--better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy.\\nBut no, there was something gaudier even than this.\\nHe would be a pirate!\\nThat was it!\\n_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor.\\nHow his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!\\nHow gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore!\\nAnd at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings, \"It\\'s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!--the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main.\"\\nYes, it was settled; his career was determined.\\nHe would run away from home and enter upon it.\\nHe would start the very next morning.\\nTherefore he must now begin to get ready.\\nHe would collect his resources together.\\nHe went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife.\\nHe soon struck wood that sounded hollow.\\nHe put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:  \"What hasn\\'t come here, come!\\nWhat\\'s here, stay here.\"\\nThen he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle.\\nHe took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles.\\nIn it lay a marble.\\nTom\\'s astonishment was bound-less!\\nHe scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:  \"Well, that beats anything.\"\\nThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating.\\nThe truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible.\\nIf you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been separated.\\nBut now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.\\nTom\\'s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations.\\nHe had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before.\\nIt did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward.\\nHe puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm.\\nHe thought he would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it.\\nHe laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called--  \"Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!\\nDoodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know.\"\\nThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright.\\n\"He dasn\\'t tell!\\nSo it _was_ a witch that done it.\\nI just knowed it.\"\\nHe well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he gave up discouraged.\\nBut it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a patient search for it.\\nBut he could not find it.\\nNow he went back to his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:  \"Brother, go find your brother.\"\\nHe watched where it stopped, and went there and looked.\\nBut it must have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more.\\nThe last repetition was successful.\\nThe two marbles lay within a foot of each other.\\nJust here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest.\\nTom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged, with fluttering shirt.\\nHe presently halted under a great elm, blew an answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way and that.\\nHe said cautiously--to an imaginary company:  \"Hold, my merry men!\\nKeep hid till I blow.\"\\nNow appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.\\nTom called:  \"Hold!\\nWho comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?\"\\n\"Guy of Guisborne wants no man\\'s pass.\\nWho art thou that--that-.\"\\n\"Dares to hold such language.\"\\nsaid Tom, prompting--for they talked \"by the book.\"\\nfrom memory.\\n\"Who art thou that dares to hold such language?\"\\n\"I, indeed!\\nI am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.\"\\n\"Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw?\\nRight gladly will I dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood.\\nHave at thee.\"\\nThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, \"two up and two down.\"\\nPresently Tom said:  \"Now, if you\\'ve got the hang, go it lively.\"\\nSo they \"went it lively.\"\\npanting and perspiring with the work.\\nBy and by Tom shouted:  \"Fall!\\nfall!\\nWhy don\\'t you fall?\"\\n\"I sha\\'n\\'t!\\nWhy don\\'t you fall yourself?\\nYou\\'re getting the worst of it.\"\\n\"Why, that ain\\'t anything.\\nI can\\'t fall; that ain\\'t the way it is in the book.\\nThe book says, \\'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.\\' You\\'re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.\"\\nThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and fell.\\n\"Now.\"\\nsaid Joe, getting up, \"you got to let me kill _you_.\\nThat\\'s fair.\"\\n\"Why, I can\\'t do that, it ain\\'t in the book.\"\\n\"Well, it\\'s blamed mean--that\\'s all.\"\\n\"Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller\\'s son, and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I\\'ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.\"\\nThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out.\\nThen Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound.\\nAnd at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, \"Where this arrow falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.\"\\nThen he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.\\nThe boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.\\nThey said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever.\\nThey said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep.\\nTom lay awake and waited, in restless impatience.\\nWhen it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten!\\nThis was despair.\\nHe would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid.\\nSo he lay still, and stared up into the dark.\\nEverything was dismally still.\\nBy and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves.\\nThe ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice.\\nOld beams began to crack mysteriously.\\nThe stairs creaked faintly.\\nEvidently spirits were abroad.\\nA measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly\\'s chamber.\\nAnd now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began.\\nNext the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed\\'s head made Tom shudder--it meant that somebody\\'s days were numbered.\\nThen the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance.\\nTom was in an agony.\\nAt last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it.\\nAnd then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling.\\nThe raising of a neighboring window disturbed him.\\nA cry of \"Scat!\\nyou devil.\"\\nand the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt\\'s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the \"el.\"\\non all fours.\\nHe \"meow\\'.\"\\nwith caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground.\\nHuckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat.\\nThe boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom.\\nAt the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.\\nIt was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind.\\nIt was on a hill, about a mile and a half from the village.\\nIt had a crazy board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere.\\nGrass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery.\\nAll the old graves were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding none.\\n\"Sacred to the memory o.\"\\nSo-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.\\nA faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed.\\nThe boys talked little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits.\\nThey found the sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.\\nThen they waited in silence for what seemed a long time.\\nThe hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness.\\nTom\\'s reflections grew oppressive.\\nHe must force some talk.\\nSo he said in a whisper:  \"Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?\"\\nHuckleberry whispered:  \"I wisht I knowed.\\nIt\\'s awful solemn like, _ain\\'t_ it?\"\\n\"I bet it is.\"\\nThere was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly.\\nThen Tom whispered:  \"Say, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?\"\\n\"O\\' course he does.\\nLeast his sperrit does.\"\\nTom, after a pause:  \"I wish I\\'d said Mister Williams.\\nBut I never meant any harm.\\nEverybody calls him Hoss.\"\\n\"A body can\\'t be too partic\\'lar how they talk \\'bout these-yer dead people, Tom.\"\\nThis was a damper, and conversation died again.\\nPresently Tom seized his comrade\\'s arm and said:  \"Sh.\"\\n\"What is it, Tom?\"\\nAnd the two clung together with beating hearts.\\n\"Sh!\\nThere \\'tis again!\\nDidn\\'t you hear it?\"\\n\"I-.\"\\n\"There!\\nNow you hear it.\"\\n\"Lord, Tom, they\\'re coming!\\nThey\\'re coming, sure.\\nWhat\\'ll we do?\"\\n\"I dono.\\nThink they\\'ll see us?\"\\n\"Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats.\\nI wisht I hadn\\'t come.\"\\n\"Oh, don\\'t be afeard.\\nI don\\'t believe they\\'ll bother us.\\nWe ain\\'t doing any harm.\\nIf we keep perfectly still, maybe they won\\'t notice us at all.\"\\n\"I\\'ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I\\'m all of a shiver.\"\\n\"Listen.\"\\nThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed.\\nA muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\\n\"Look!\\nSee there.\"\\nwhispered Tom.\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\"It\\'s devil-fire.\\nOh, Tom, this is awful.\"\\nSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light.\\nPresently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder:  \"It\\'s the devils sure enough.\\nThree of \\'em!\\nLordy, Tom, we\\'re goners!\\nCan you pray?\"\\n\"I\\'ll try, but don\\'t you be afeard.\\nThey ain\\'t going to hurt us.\\n\\'Now I lay me down to sleep, I--.\"\\n\"Sh.\"\\n\"What is it, Huck?\"\\n\"They\\'re _humans_!\\nOne of \\'em is, anyway.\\nOne of \\'em\\'s old Muff Potter\\'s voice.\"\\n\"No--\\'tain\\'t so, is it?\"\\n\"I bet I know it.\\nDon\\'t you stir nor budge.\\nHe ain\\'t sharp enough to notice us.\\nDrunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip.\"\\n\"All right, I\\'ll keep still.\\nNow they\\'re stuck.\\nCan\\'t find it.\\nHere they come again.\\nNow they\\'re hot.\\nCold again.\\nHot again.\\nRed hot!\\nThey\\'re p\\'inted right, this time.\\nSay, Huck, I know another o\\' them voices; it\\'s Injun Joe.\"\\n\"That\\'s so--that murderin\\' half-breed!\\nI\\'d druther they was devils a dern sight.\\nWhat kin they be up to?\"\\nThe whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys\\' hiding-place.\\n\"Here it is.\"\\nsaid the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.\\nPotter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple of shovels on it.\\nThey cast down their load and began to open the grave.\\nThe doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees.\\nHe was so close the boys could have touched him.\\n\"Hurry, men.\"\\nhe said, in a low voice; \"the moon might come out at any moment.\"\\nThey growled a response and went on digging.\\nFor some time there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel.\\nIt was very monotonous.\\nFinally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground.\\nThey pried off the lid with their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground.\\nThe moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.\\nThe barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope.\\nPotter took out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:  \"Now the cussed thing\\'s ready, Sawbones, and you\\'ll just out with another five, or here she stays.\"\\n\"That\\'s the talk.\"\\nsaid Injun Joe.\\n\"Look here, what does this mean?\"\\nsaid the doctor.\\n\"You required your pay in advance, and I\\'ve paid you.\"\\n\"Yes, and you done more than that.\"\\nsaid Injun Joe, approaching the doctor, who was now standing.\\n\"Five years ago you drove me away from your father\\'s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to eat, and you said I warn\\'t there for any good; and when I swore I\\'d get even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for a vagrant.\\nDid you think I\\'d forget?\\nThe Injun blood ain\\'t in me for nothing.\\nAnd now I\\'ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know.\"\\nHe was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.\\nThe doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.\\nPotter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:  \"Here, now, don\\'t you hit my pard.\"\\nand the next moment he had grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main, trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels.\\nInjun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter\\'s knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about the combatants, seeking an opportunity.\\nAll at once the doctor flung himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams\\' grave and felled Potter to the earth with it--and in the same instant the half-breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man\\'s breast.\\nHe reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.\\nPresently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the two forms, contemplating them.\\nThe doctor murmured inarticulately, gave a long gasp or two and was still.\\nThe half-breed muttered:  \"_That_ score is settled--damn you.\"\\nThen he robbed the body.\\nAfter which he put the fatal knife in Potter\\'s open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin.\\nThree--four--five minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan.\\nHis hand closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a shudder.\\nThen he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and then around him, confusedly.\\nHis eyes met Joe\\'s.\\n\"Lord, how is this, Joe?\"\\nhe said.\\n\"It\\'s a dirty business.\"\\nsaid Joe, without moving.\\n\"What did you do it for?\"\\n\"I!\\nI never done it.\"\\n\"Look here!\\nThat kind of talk won\\'t wash.\"\\nPotter trembled and grew white.\\n\"I thought I\\'d got sober.\\nI\\'d no business to drink to-night.\\nBut it\\'s in my head yet--worse\\'n when we started here.\\nI\\'m all in a muddle; can\\'t recollect anything of it, hardly.\\nTell me, Joe--_honest_, now, old feller--did I do it?\\nJoe, I never meant to--\\'pon my soul and honor, I never meant to, Joe.\\nTell me how it was, Joe.\\nOh, it\\'s awful--and him so young and promising.\"\\n\"Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched you another awful clip--and here you\\'ve laid, as dead as a wedge til now.\"\\n\"Oh, I didn\\'t know what I was a-doing.\\nI wish I may die this minute if I did.\\nIt was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.\\nI never used a weepon in my life before, Joe.\\nI\\'ve fought, but never with weepons.\\nThey\\'ll all say that.\\nJoe, don\\'t tell!\\nSay you won\\'t tell, Joe--that\\'s a good feller.\\nI always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too.\\nDon\\'t you remember?\\nYou _won\\'t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?\"\\nAnd the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing hands.\\n\"No, you\\'ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won\\'t go back on you.\\nThere, now, that\\'s as fair as a man can say.\"\\n\"Oh, Joe, you\\'re an angel.\\nI\\'ll bless you for this the longest day I live.\"\\nAnd Potter began to cry.\\n\"Come, now, that\\'s enough of that.\\nThis ain\\'t any time for blubbering.\\nYou be off yonder way and I\\'ll go this.\\nMove, now, and don\\'t leave any tracks behind you.\"\\nPotter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run.\\nThe half-breed stood looking after him.\\nHe muttered:  \"If he\\'s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being, he won\\'t think of the knife till he\\'s gone so far he\\'ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself--chicken-heart.\"\\nTwo or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the moon\\'s.\\nThe stillness was complete again, too.\\nThey glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed.\\nEvery stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet.\\n\"If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down.\"\\nwhispered Tom, in short catches between breaths.\\n\"I can\\'t stand it much longer.\"\\nHuckleberry\\'s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.\\nThey gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond.\\nBy and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:  \"Huckleberry, what do you reckon\\'ll come of this?\"\\n\"If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging\\'ll come of it.\"\\n\"Do you though?\"\\n\"Why, I _know_ it, Tom.\"\\nTom thought a while, then he said:  \"Who\\'ll tell?\\nWe?\"\\n\"What are you talking about?\\nS\\'pose something happened and Injun Joe _didn\\'t_ hang?\\nWhy, he\\'d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as we\\'re a laying here.\"\\n\"That\\'s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.\"\\n\"If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he\\'s fool enough.\\nHe\\'s generally drunk enough.\"\\nTom said nothing--went on thinking.\\nPresently he whispered:  \"Huck, Muff Potter don\\'t know it.\\nHow can he tell?\"\\n\"What\\'s the reason he don\\'t know it?\"\\n\"Because he\\'d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it.\\nD\\'you reckon he could see anything?\\nD\\'you reckon he knowed anything?\"\\n\"By hokey, that\\'s so, Tom.\"\\n\"And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_.\"\\n\"No, \\'taint likely, Tom.\\nHe had liquor in him; I could see that; and besides, he always has.\\nWell, when pap\\'s full, you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you couldn\\'t phase him.\\nHe says so, his own self.\\nSo it\\'s the same with Muff Potter, of course.\\nBut if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.\"\\nAfter another reflective silence, Tom said:  \"Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?\"\\n\"Tom, we _got_ to keep mum.\\nYou know that.\\nThat Injun devil wouldn\\'t make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak \\'bout this and they didn\\'t hang him.\\nNow, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another--that\\'s what we got to do--swear to keep mum.\"\\n\"I\\'m agreed.\\nIt\\'s the best thing.\\nWould you just hold hands and swear that we-.\"\\n\"Oh no, that wouldn\\'t do for this.\\nThat\\'s good enough for little rubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing \\'bout a big thing like this.\\nAnd blood.\"\\nTom\\'s whole being applauded this idea.\\nIt was deep, and dark, and awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.\\nHe picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a little fragment of \"red kee.\"\\nout of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes.\\n[See next page.]  \"Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.\"\\nHuckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom\\'s facility in writing, and the sublimity of his language.\\nHe at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:  \"Hold on!\\nDon\\'t do that.\\nA pin\\'s brass.\\nIt might have verdigrease on it.\"\\n\"What\\'s verdigrease?\"\\n\"It\\'s p\\'ison.\\nThat\\'s what it is.\\nYou just swaller some of it once--you\\'ll see.\"\\nSo Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood.\\nIn time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his little finger for a pen.\\nThen he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete.\\nThey buried the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away.\\nA figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it.\\n\"Tom.\"\\nwhispered Huckleberry, \"does this keep us from _ever_ telling--_always_?\"\\n\"Of course it does.\\nIt don\\'t make any difference _what_ happens, we got to keep mum.\\nWe\\'d drop down dead--don\\'t _you_ know that?\"\\n\"Yes, I reckon that\\'s so.\"\\nThey continued to whisper for some little time.\\nPresently a dog set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them.\\nThe boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.\\n\"Which of us does he mean?\"\\ngasped Huckleberry.\\n\"I dono--peep through the crack.\\nQuick.\"\\n\"No, _you_, Tom.\"\\n\"I can\\'t--I can\\'t _do_ it, Huck.\"\\n\"Please, Tom.\\nThere \\'tis again.\"\\n\"Oh, lordy, I\\'m thankful.\"\\nwhispered Tom.\\n\"I know his voice.\\nIt\\'s Bull Harbison.\"\\n*  [* If Mr.\\nHarbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as \"Harbison\\'s Bull.\"\\nbut a son or a dog of that name was \"Bull Harbison.\"]  \"Oh, that\\'s good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I\\'d a bet anything it was a _stray_ dog.\"\\nThe dog howled again.\\nThe boys\\' hearts sank once more.\\n\"Oh, my!\\nthat ain\\'t no Bull Harbison.\"\\nwhispered Huckleberry.\\n\"_Do_, Tom.\"\\nTom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack.\\nHis whisper was hardly audible when he said:  \"Oh, Huck, _its a stray dog_.\"\\n\"Quick, Tom, quick!\\nWho does he mean?\"\\n\"Huck, he must mean us both--we\\'re right together.\"\\n\"Oh, Tom, I reckon we\\'re goners.\\nI reckon there ain\\'t no mistake \\'bout where _I\\'ll_ go to.\\nI been so wicked.\"\\n\"Dad fetch it!\\nThis comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller\\'s told _not_ to do.\\nI might a been good, like Sid, if I\\'d a tried--but no, I wouldn\\'t, of course.\\nBut if ever I get off this time, I lay I\\'ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools.\"\\nAnd Tom began to snuffle a little.\\n\"_You_ bad.\"\\nand Huckleberry began to snuffle too.\\n\"Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you\\'re just old pie, \\'long-side o\\' what I am.\\nOh, _lordy_, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.\"\\nTom choked off and whispered:  \"Look, Hucky, look!\\nHe\\'s got his _back_ to us.\"\\nHucky looked, with joy in his heart.\\n\"Well, he has, by jingoes!\\nDid he before?\"\\n\"Yes, he did.\\nBut I, like a fool, never thought.\\nOh, this is bully, you know.\\n_Now_ who can he mean?\"\\nThe howling stopped.\\nTom pricked up his ears.\\n\"Sh!\\nWhat\\'s that?\"\\nhe whispered.\\n\"Sounds like--like hogs grunting.\\nNo--it\\'s somebody snoring, Tom.\"\\n\"That _is_ it!\\nWhere \\'bouts is it, Huck?\"\\n\"I bleeve it\\'s down at \\'tother end.\\nSounds so, anyway.\\nPap used to sleep there, sometimes, \\'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when _he_ snores.\\nBesides, I reckon he ain\\'t ever coming back to this town any more.\"\\nThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys\\' souls once more.\\n\"Hucky, do you das\\'t to go if I lead?\"\\n\"I don\\'t like to, much.\\nTom, s\\'pose it\\'s Injun Joe.\"\\nTom quailed.\\nBut presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped.\\nSo they went tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other.\\nWhen they had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap.\\nThe man moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight.\\nIt was Muff Potter.\\nThe boys\\' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now.\\nThey tip-toed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word.\\nThat long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air again!\\nThey turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose pointing heavenward.\\n\"Oh, geeminy, it\\'s _him_.\"\\nexclaimed both boys, in a breath.\\n\"Say, Tom--they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller\\'s house, \\'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there ain\\'t anybody dead there yet.\"\\n\"Well, I know that.\\nAnd suppose there ain\\'t.\\nDidn\\'t Gracie Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?\"\\n\"Yes, but she ain\\'t _dead_.\\nAnd what\\'s more, she\\'s getting better, too.\"\\n\"All right, you wait and see.\\nShe\\'s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff Potter\\'s a goner.\\nThat\\'s what the niggers say, and they know all about these kind of things, Huck.\"\\nThen they separated, cogitating.\\nWhen Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent.\\nHe undressed with excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade.\\nHe was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.\\nWhen Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone.\\nThere was a late look in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere.\\nHe was startled.\\nWhy had he not been called--persecuted till he was up, as usual?\\nThe thought filled him with bodings.\\nWithin five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy.\\nThe family were still at table, but they had finished breakfast.\\nThere was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit\\'s heart.\\nHe sat down and tried to seem gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.\\nAfter breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so.\\nHis aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.\\nThis was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom\\'s heart was sorer now than his body.\\nHe cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.\\nHe left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid; and so the latter\\'s prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary.\\nHe moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging, along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles.\\nThen he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.\\nHis elbow was pressing against some hard substance.\\nAfter a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with a sigh.\\nIt was in a paper.\\nHe unrolled it.\\nA long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, and his heart broke.\\nIt was his brass andiron knob!\\nThis final feather broke the camel\\'s back.\\nNo need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph; the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house, with little less than telegraphic speed.\\nOf course the schoolmaster gave holi-day for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not.\\nA gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter--so the story ran.\\nAnd it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself in the \"branc.\"\\nabout one or two o\\'clock in the morning, and that Potter had at once sneaked off--suspicious circumstances, especially the washing which was not a habit with Potter.\\nIt was also said that the town had been ransacked for this \"murdere.\"\\n(the public are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he could not be found.\\nHorsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff \"was confiden.\"\\nthat he would be captured before night.\\nAll the town was drifting toward the graveyard.\\nTom\\'s heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful, unaccountable fascination drew him on.\\nArrived at the dreadful place, he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.\\nIt seemed to him an age since he was there before.\\nSomebody pinched his arm.\\nHe turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry\\'s.\\nThen both looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance.\\nBut everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them.\\n\"Poor fellow.\"\\n\"Poor young fellow.\"\\n\"This ought to be a lesson to grave robbers.\"\\n\"Muff Potter\\'ll hang for this if they catch him.\"\\nThis was the drift of remark; and the minister said, \"It was a judgment; His hand is here.\"\\nNow Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid face of Injun Joe.\\nAt this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle, and voices shouted, \"It\\'s him!\\nit\\'s him!\\nhe\\'s coming himself.\"\\n\"Who?\\nWho?\"\\nfrom twenty voices.\\n\"Muff Potter.\"\\n\"Hallo, he\\'s stopped!--Look out, he\\'s turning!\\nDon\\'t let him get away.\"\\nPeople in the branches of the trees over Tom\\'s head said he wasn\\'t trying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed.\\n\"Infernal impudence.\"\\nsaid a bystander; \"wanted to come and take a quiet look at his work, I reckon--didn\\'t expect any company.\"\\nThe crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously leading Potter by the arm.\\nThe poor fellow\\'s face was haggard, and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him.\\nWhen he stood before the murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears.\\n\"I didn\\'t do it, friends.\"\\nhe sobbed; \"\\'pon my word and honor I never done it.\"\\n\"Who\\'s accused you?\"\\nshouted a voice.\\nThis shot seemed to carry home.\\nPotter lifted his face and looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes.\\nHe saw Injun Joe, and exclaimed:  \"Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you\\'d never-.\"\\n\"Is that your knife?\"\\nand it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.\\nPotter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the ground.\\nThen he said:  \"Something told me \\'t if I didn\\'t come back and get-.\"\\nHe shuddered; then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, \"Tell \\'em, Joe, tell \\'em--it ain\\'t any use any more.\"\\nThen Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every moment that the clear sky would deliver God\\'s lightnings upon his head, and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed.\\nAnd when he had finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner\\'s life faded and vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.\\n\"Why didn\\'t you leave?\\nWhat did you want to come here for?\"\\nsomebody said.\\n\"I couldn\\'t help it--I couldn\\'t help it.\"\\nPotter moaned.\\n\"I wanted to run away, but I couldn\\'t seem to come anywhere but here.\"\\nAnd he fell to sobbing again.\\nInjun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that Joe had sold himself to the devil.\\nHe was now become, to them, the most balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face.\\nThey inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.\\nInjun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little!\\nThe boys thought that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:  \"It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.\"\\nTom\\'s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:  \"Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time.\"\\nTom blanched and dropped his eyes.\\n\"It\\'s a bad sign.\"\\nsaid Aunt Polly, gravely.\\n\"What you got on your mind, Tom?\"\\n\"Nothing.\\nNothing \\'t I know of.\"\\nBut the boy\\'s hand shook so that he spilled his coffee.\\n\"And you do talk such stuff.\"\\nSid said.\\n\"Last night you said, \\'It\\'s blood, it\\'s blood, that\\'s what it is!\\' You said that over and over.\\nAnd you said, \\'Don\\'t torment me so--I\\'ll tell!\\' Tell _what_?\\nWhat is it you\\'ll tell?\"\\nEverything was swimming before Tom.\\nThere is no telling what might have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly\\'s face and she came to Tom\\'s relief without knowing it.\\nShe said:  \"Sho!\\nIt\\'s that dreadful murder.\\nI dream about it most every night myself.\\nSometimes I dream it\\'s me that done it.\"\\nMary said she had been affected much the same way.\\nSid seemed satisfied.\\nTom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every night.\\nHe never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again.\\nTom\\'s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded.\\nIf Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom\\'s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.\\nIt seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.\\nSid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries, though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness--and that was strange; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could.\\nSid marvelled, but said nothing.\\nHowever, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and ceased to torture Tom\\'s conscience.\\nEvery day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such small comforts through to the \"murdere.\"\\nas he could get hold of.\\nThe jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it was seldom occupied.\\nThese offerings greatly helped to ease Tom\\'s conscience.\\nThe villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the matter, so it was dropped.\\nHe had been careful to begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present.\\nBecky Thatcher had stopped coming to school.\\nTom had struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to \"whistle her down the wind.\"\\nbut failed.\\nHe began to find himself hanging around her father\\'s house, nights, and feeling very miserable.\\nShe was ill.\\nWhat if she should die!\\nThere was distraction in the thought.\\nHe no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy.\\nThe charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left.\\nHe put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any more.\\nHis aunt was concerned.\\nShe began to try all manner of remedies on him.\\nShe was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it.\\nShe was an inveterate experimenter in these things.\\nWhen something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy.\\nShe was a subscriber for all the \"Healt.\"\\nperiodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils.\\nAll the \"ro.\"\\nthey contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one\\'s self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before.\\nShe was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim.\\nShe gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with \"hell following after.\"\\nBut she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.\\nThe water treatment was new, now, and Tom\\'s low condition was a windfall to her.\\nShe had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and \"the yellow stains of it came through his pores\"--as Tom said.\\nYet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected.\\nShe added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges.\\nThe boy remained as dismal as a hearse.\\nShe began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters.\\nShe calculated his capacity as she would a jug\\'s, and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.\\nTom had become indifferent to persecution by this time.\\nThis phase filled the old lady\\'s heart with consternation.\\nThis indifference must be broken up at any cost.\\nNow she heard of Pain-killer for the first time.\\nShe ordered a lot at once.\\nShe tasted it and was filled with gratitude.\\nIt was simply fire in a liquid form.\\nShe dropped the water treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.\\nShe gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result.\\nHer troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for the \"indifferenc.\"\\nwas broken up.\\nThe boy could not have shown a wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.\\nTom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it.\\nSo he thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer.\\nHe asked for it so often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her.\\nIf it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely.\\nShe found that the medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor with it.\\nOne day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt\\'s yellow cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging for a taste.\\nTom said:  \"Don\\'t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.\"\\nBut Peter signified that he did want it.\\n\"You better make sure.\"\\nPeter was sure.\\n\"Now you\\'ve asked for it, and I\\'ll give it to you, because there ain\\'t anything mean about me; but if you find you don\\'t like it, you mustn\\'t blame anybody but your own self.\"\\nPeter was agreeable.\\nSo Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the Pain-killer.\\nPeter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc.\\nNext he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness.\\nThen he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path.\\nAunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him.\\nThe old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.\\n\"Tom, what on earth ails that cat?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know, aunt.\"\\ngasped the boy.\\n\"Why, I never see anything like it.\\nWhat did make him act so?\"\\n\"Deed I don\\'t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they\\'re having a good time.\"\\n\"They do, do they?\"\\nThere was something in the tone that made Tom apprehensive.\\n\"Yes\\'m.\\nThat is, I believe they do.\"\\n\"You _do_?\"\\n\"Yes\\'m.\"\\nThe old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized by anxiety.\\nToo late he divined her \"drift.\"\\nThe handle of the telltale tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance.\\nAunt Polly took it, held it up.\\nTom winced, and dropped his eyes.\\nAunt Polly raised him by the usual handle--his ear--and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.\\n\"Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?\"\\n\"I done it out of pity for him--because he hadn\\'t any aunt.\"\\n\"Hadn\\'t any aunt!--you numskull.\\nWhat has that got to do with it?\"\\n\"Heaps.\\nBecause if he\\'d had one she\\'d a burnt him out herself!\\nShe\\'d a roasted his bowels out of him \\'thout any more feeling than if he was a human.\"\\nAunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse.\\nThis was putting the thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.\\nShe began to soften; she felt sorry.\\nHer eyes watered a little, and she put her hand on Tom\\'s head and said gently:  \"I was meaning for the best, Tom.\\nAnd, Tom, it _did_ do you good.\"\\nTom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity.\\n\"I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter.\\nIt done _him_ good, too.\\nI never see him get around so since-.\"\\n\"Oh, go \\'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again.\\nAnd you try and see if you can\\'t be a good boy, for once, and you needn\\'t take any more medicine.\"\\nTom reached school ahead of time.\\nIt was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly.\\nAnd now, as usual of late, he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades.\\nHe was sick, he said, and he looked it.\\nHe tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking--down the road.\\nPresently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom\\'s face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away.\\nWhen Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and \"led u.\"\\nwarily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait.\\nTom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one.\\nAt last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer.\\nThen one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom\\'s heart gave a great bound.\\nThe next instant he was out, and \"going o.\"\\nlike an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing on his head--doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing.\\nBut she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked.\\nCould it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?\\nHe carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy\\'s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky\\'s nose, almost upsetting her--and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: \"Mf!\\nsome people think they\\'re mighty smart--always showing off.\"\\nTom\\'s cheeks burned.\\nHe gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and crestfallen.\\nHe was gloomy and desperate.\\nHe was a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame _him_ for the consequences--why shouldn\\'t they?\\nWhat right had the friendless to complain?\\nYes, they had forced him to it at last: he would lead a life of crime.\\nThere was no choice.\\nBy this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to \"take u.\"\\ntinkled faintly upon his ear.\\nHe sobbed, now, to think he should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more--it was very hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold world, he must submit--but he forgave them.\\nThen the sobs came thick and fast.\\nJust at this point he met his soul\\'s sworn comrade, Joe Harper--hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart.\\nPlainly here were \"two souls with but a single thought.\"\\nTom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him.\\nBut it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose.\\nHis mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.\\nAs the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their troubles.\\nThen they began to lay their plans.\\nJoe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.\\nThree miles below St.\\nPetersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous.\\nIt was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest.\\nSo Jackson\\'s Island was chosen.\\nWho were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them.\\nThen they hunted up Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was indifferent.\\nThey presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour--which was midnight.\\nThere was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.\\nEach would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws.\\nAnd before the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would \"hear something.\"\\nAll who got this vague hint were cautioned to \"be mum and wait.\"\\nAbout midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place.\\nIt was starlight, and very still.\\nThe mighty river lay like an ocean at rest.\\nTom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the quiet.\\nThen he gave a low, distinct whistle.\\nIt was answered from under the bluff.\\nTom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the same way.\\nThen a guarded voice said:  \"Who goes there?\"\\n\"Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main.\\nName your names.\"\\n\"Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.\"\\nTom had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.\\n\"\\'Tis well.\\nGive the countersign.\"\\nTwo hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night:  \"_Blood_.\"\\nThen Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it, tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort.\\nThere was an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.\\nThe Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn himself out with getting it there.\\nFinn the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes with.\\nBut none of the pirates smoked or \"chewe.\"\\nbut himself.\\nThe Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire.\\nThat was a wise thought; matches were hardly known there in that day.\\nThey saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk.\\nThey made an imposing adventure of it, saying, \"Hist.\"\\nevery now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if \"the fo.\"\\nstirred, to \"let him have it to the hilt.\"\\nbecause \"dead men tell no tales.\"\\nThey knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.\\nThey shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and Joe at the forward.\\nTom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:  \"Luff, and bring her to the wind.\"\\n\"Aye-aye, sir.\"\\n\"Steady, steady-y-y-y.\"\\n\"Steady it is, sir.\"\\n\"Let her go off a point.\"\\n\"Point it is, sir.\"\\nAs the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for \"style.\"\\nand were not intended to mean anything in particular.\\n\"What sail\\'s she carrying?\"\\n\"Courses, tops\\'ls, and flying-jib, sir.\"\\n\"Send the r\\'yals up!\\nLay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye--foretopmaststuns\\'l!\\nLively, now.\"\\n\"Aye-aye, sir.\"\\n\"Shake out that maintogalans\\'l!\\nSheets and braces!\\n_now_ my hearties.\"\\n\"Aye-aye, sir.\"\\n\"Hellum-a-lee--hard a port!\\nStand by to meet her when she comes!\\nPort, port!\\n_Now_, men!\\nWith a will!\\nStead-y-y-y.\"\\n\"Steady it is, sir.\"\\nThe raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head right, and then lay on their oars.\\nThe river was not high, so there was not more than a two or three mile current.\\nHardly a word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour.\\nNow the raft was passing before the distant town.\\nTwo or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening.\\nThe Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, \"looking his las.\"\\nupon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing \"sh.\"\\ncould see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips.\\nIt was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson\\'s Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he \"looked his las.\"\\nwith a broken and satisfied heart.\\nThe other pirates were looking their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island.\\nBut they discovered the danger in time, and made shift to avert it.\\nAbout two o\\'clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight.\\nPart of the little raft\\'s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.\\nThey built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn \"pon.\"\\nstock they had brought.\\nIt seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild, free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island, far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to civilization.\\nThe climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines.\\nWhen the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass, filled with contentment.\\nThey could have found a cooler place, but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting campfire.\\n\"_Ain\\'t_ it gay?\"\\nsaid Joe.\\n\"It\\'s _nuts_.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"What would the boys say if they could see us?\"\\n\"Say?\\nWell, they\\'d just die to be here--hey, Hucky.\"\\n\"I reckon so.\"\\nsaid Huckleberry; \"anyways, I\\'m suited.\\nI don\\'t want nothing better\\'n this.\\nI don\\'t ever get enough to eat, gen\\'ally--and here they can\\'t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.\"\\n\"It\\'s just the life for me.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"You don\\'t have to get up, mornings, and you don\\'t have to go to school, and wash, and all that blame foolishness.\\nYou see a pirate don\\'t have to do _anything_, Joe, when he\\'s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and then he don\\'t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.\"\\n\"Oh yes, that\\'s so.\"\\nsaid Joe, \"but I hadn\\'t thought much about it, you know.\\nI\\'d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I\\'ve tried it.\"\\n\"You see.\"\\nsaid Tom, \"people don\\'t go much on hermits, nowadays, like they used to in old times, but a pirate\\'s always respected.\\nAnd a hermit\\'s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and-.\"\\n\"What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?\"\\ninquired Huck.\\n\"I dono.\\nBut they\\'ve _got_ to do it.\\nHermits always do.\\nYou\\'d have to do that if you was a hermit.\"\\n\"Dern\\'d if I would.\"\\nsaid Huck.\\n\"Well, what would you do?\"\\n\"I dono.\\nBut I wouldn\\'t do that.\"\\n\"Why, Huck, you\\'d _have_ to.\\nHow\\'d you get around it?\"\\n\"Why, I just wouldn\\'t stand it.\\nI\\'d run away.\"\\n\"Run away!\\nWell, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit.\\nYou\\'d be a disgrace.\"\\nThe Red-Handed made no response, being better employed.\\nHe had finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment.\\nThe other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly.\\nPresently Huck said:  \"What does pirates have to do?\"\\nTom said:  \"Oh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there\\'s ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make \\'em walk a plank.\"\\n\"And they carry the women to the island.\"\\nsaid Joe; \"they don\\'t kill the women.\"\\n\"No.\"\\nassented Tom, \"they don\\'t kill the women--they\\'re too noble.\\nAnd the women\\'s always beautiful, too.\\n\"And don\\'t they wear the bulliest clothes!\\nOh no!\\nAll gold and silver and di\\'monds.\"\\nsaid Joe, with enthusiasm.\\n\"Who?\"\\nsaid Huck.\\n\"Why, the pirates.\"\\nHuck scanned his own clothing forlornly.\\n\"I reckon I ain\\'t dressed fitten for a pirate.\"\\nsaid he, with a regretful pathos in his voice; \"but I ain\\'t got none but these.\"\\nBut the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough, after they should have begun their adventures.\\nThey made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.\\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs.\\nThe pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.\\nThe Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep.\\nThey said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven.\\nThen at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep--but an intruder came, now, that would not \"down.\"\\nIt was conscience.\\nThey began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.\\nThey tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only \"hooking.\"\\nwhile taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing--and there was a command against that in the Bible.\\nSo they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing.\\nThen conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.\\nHe sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around.\\nThen he comprehended.\\nIt was the cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods.\\nNot a leaf stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature\\'s meditation.\\nBeaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses.\\nA white layer of ashes covered the fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air.\\nJoe and Huck still slept.\\nNow, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard.\\nGradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself.\\nThe marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy.\\nA little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and \"sniffing around.\"\\nthen proceeding again--for he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom\\'s leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform.\\nNow a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk.\\nA brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, \"Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children\\'s alone.\"\\nand she took wing and went off to see about it--which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once.\\nA tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead.\\nThe birds were fairly rioting by this time.\\nA catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom\\'s head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy\\'s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the \"fo.\"\\nkind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.\\nAll Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.\\nTom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar.\\nThey felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water.\\nA vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization.\\nThey came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again.\\nHuck found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee.\\nWhile Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward.\\nJoe had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions enough for quite a family.\\nThey fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before.\\nThey did not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.\\nThey lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke, and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition.\\nThey tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines.\\nNow and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.\\nThey found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be astonished at.\\nThey discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide.\\nThey took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp.\\nThey were too hungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk.\\nBut the talk soon began to drag, and then died.\\nThe stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.\\nThey fell to thinking.\\nA sort of undefined longing crept upon them.\\nThis took dim shape, presently--it was budding homesickness.\\nEven Finn the Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads.\\nBut they were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak his thought.\\nFor some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of.\\nBut now this mysterious sound became more pronounced, and forced a recognition.\\nThe boys started, glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude.\\nThere was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the distance.\\n\"What is it.\"\\nexclaimed Joe, under his breath.\\n\"I wonder.\"\\nsaid Tom in a whisper.\\n\"\\'Tain\\'t thunder.\"\\nsaid Huckleberry, in an awed tone, \"becuz thunder-.\"\\n\"Hark.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"Listen--don\\'t talk.\"\\nThey waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush.\\n\"Let\\'s go and see.\"\\nThey sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town.\\nThey parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water.\\nThe little steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the current.\\nHer broad deck seemed crowded with people.\\nThere were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing.\\nPresently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat\\'s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.\\n\"I know now.\"\\nexclaimed Tom; \"somebody\\'s drownded.\"\\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\nsaid Huck; \"they done that last summer, when Bill Turner got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him come up to the top.\\nYes, and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in \\'em and set \\'em afloat, and wherever there\\'s anybody that\\'s drownded, they\\'ll float right there and stop.\"\\n\"Yes, I\\'ve heard about that.\"\\nsaid Joe.\\n\"I wonder what makes the bread do that.\"\\n\"Oh, it ain\\'t the bread, so much.\"\\nsaid Tom; \"I reckon it\\'s mostly what they _say_ over it before they start it out.\"\\n\"But they don\\'t say anything over it.\"\\nsaid Huck.\\n\"I\\'ve seen \\'em and they don\\'t.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s funny.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"But maybe they say it to themselves.\\nOf _course_ they do.\\nAnybody might know that.\"\\nThe other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity.\\n\"By jings, I wish I was over there, now.\"\\nsaid Joe.\\n\"I do to.\"\\nsaid Huck \"I\\'d give heaps to know who it is.\"\\nThe boys still listened and watched.\\nPresently a revealing thought flashed through Tom\\'s mind, and he exclaimed:  \"Boys, I know who\\'s drownded--it\\'s us.\"\\nThey felt like heroes in an instant.\\nHere was a gorgeous triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned.\\nThis was fine.\\nIt was worth while to be a pirate, after all.\\nAs twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared.\\nThe pirates returned to camp.\\nThey were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making.\\nThey caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon--from their point of view.\\nBut when the shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere.\\nThe excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were.\\nMisgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares.\\nBy and by Joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout \"feele.\"\\nas to how the others might look upon a return to civilization--not right now, but--  Tom withered him with derision!\\nHuck, being uncommitted as yet, joined in with Tom, and the waverer quickly \"explained.\"\\nand was glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness clinging to his garments as he could.\\nMutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment.\\nAs the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.\\nJoe followed next.\\nTom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time, watching the two intently.\\nAt last he got up cautiously, on his knees, and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung by the campfire.\\nHe picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed to suit him.\\nThen he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his \"red keel\"; one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe\\'s hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner.\\nAnd he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value--among them a lump of chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind of marbles known as a \"sure \\'nough crystal.\"\\nThen he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.\\nBefore the depth reached his middle he was halfway over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards.\\nHe swam quartering upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected.\\nHowever, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out.\\nHe put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments.\\nShortly before ten o\\'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.\\nEverything was quiet under the blinking stars.\\nHe crept down the bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did \"yaw.\"\\nduty at the boat\\'s stern.\\nHe laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\\nPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to \"cast off.\"\\nA minute or two later the skiff\\'s head was standing high up, against the boat\\'s swell, and the voyage was begun.\\nTom felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat\\'s last trip for the night.\\nAt the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.\\nHe flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his aunt\\'s back fence.\\nHe climbed over, approached the \"ell.\"\\nand looked in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there.\\nThere sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper\\'s mother, grouped together, talking.\\nThey were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the door.\\nTom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began, warily.\\n\"What makes the candle blow so?\"\\nsaid Aunt Polly.\\nTom hurried up.\\n\"Why, that door\\'s open, I believe.\\nWhy, of course it is.\\nNo end of strange things now.\\nGo \\'long and shut it, Sid.\"\\nTom disappeared under the bed just in time.\\nHe lay and \"breathe.\"\\nhimself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunt\\'s foot.\\n\"But as I was saying.\"\\nsaid Aunt Polly, \"he warn\\'t _bad_, so to say--only misch_ee_vous.\\nOnly just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know.\\nHe warn\\'t any more responsible than a colt.\\n_He_ never meant any harm, and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was\"--and she began to cry.\\n\"It was just so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never, never, poor abused boy.\"\\nAnd Mrs.\\nHarper sobbed as if her heart would break.\\n\"I hope Tom\\'s better off where he is.\"\\nsaid Sid, \"but if he\\'d been better in some ways-.\"\\n\"_Sid!.\"\\nTom felt the glare of the old lady\\'s eye, though he could not see it.\\n\"Not a word against my Tom, now that he\\'s gone!\\nGod\\'ll take care of _him_--never you trouble _your_self, sir!\\nOh, Mrs.\\nHarper, I don\\'t know how to give him up!\\nI don\\'t know how to give him up!\\nHe was such a comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, \\'most.\"\\n\"The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be the name of the Lord!\\nBut it\\'s so hard--Oh, it\\'s so hard!\\nOnly last Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.\\nLittle did I know then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over again I\\'d hug him and bless him for it.\"\\n\"Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs.\\nHarper, I know just exactly how you feel.\\nNo longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would tear the house down.\\nAnd God forgive me, I cracked Tom\\'s head with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy.\\nBut he\\'s out of all his troubles now.\\nAnd the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach-.\"\\nBut this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely down.\\nTom was snuffling, now, himself--and more in pity of himself than anybody else.\\nHe could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word for him from time to time.\\nHe began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before.\\nStill, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt\\'s grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy--and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.\\nHe went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim; then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing lads had promised that the village should \"hear somethin.\"\\nsoon; the wise-heads had \"put this and that togethe.\"\\nand decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below, presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village--and then hope perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner.\\nIt was believed that the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would otherwise have escaped to shore.\\nThis was Wednesday night.\\nIf the bodies continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the funerals would be preached on that morning.\\nTom shuddered.\\nMrs.\\nHarper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go.\\nThen with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other\\'s arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted.\\nAunt Polly was tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary.\\nSid snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.\\nAunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly, and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice, that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.\\nHe had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and turning over.\\nBut at last she was still, only moaning a little in her sleep.\\nNow the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her.\\nHis heart was full of pity for her.\\nHe took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle.\\nBut something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.\\nHis face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark hastily in his pocket.\\nThen he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.\\nHe threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and slept like a graven image.\\nHe untied the skiff at the stern, slipped into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream.\\nWhen he had pulled a mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work.\\nHe hit the landing on the other side neatly, for this was a familiar bit of work to him.\\nHe was moved to capture the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revelations.\\nSo he stepped ashore and entered the woods.\\nHe sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch.\\nThe night was far spent.\\nIt was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar.\\nHe rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream.\\nA little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and heard Joe say:  \"No, Tom\\'s true-blue, Huck, and he\\'ll come back.\\nHe won\\'t desert.\\nHe knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom\\'s too proud for that sort of thing.\\nHe\\'s up to something or other.\\nNow I wonder what?\"\\n\"Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain\\'t they?\"\\n\"Pretty near, but not yet, Huck.\\nThe writing says they are if he ain\\'t back here to breakfast.\"\\n\"Which he is.\"\\nexclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping grandly into camp.\\nA sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.\\nThey were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.\\nThen Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore.\\nThey went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands.\\nSometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole.\\nThey were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut.\\nThey had a famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\\nAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.\\nAnd now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other\\'s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\\nWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more.\\nFinally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored \"tight.\"\\nvery fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus--with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.\\nNext they got their marbles and played \"knuck.\"\\nand \"ringta.\"\\nand \"keep.\"\\ntill that amusement grew stale.\\nThen Joe and Huck had another swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm.\\nHe did not venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest.\\nThey gradually wandered apart, dropped into the \"dumps.\"\\nand fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun.\\nTom found himself writing \"BECK.\"\\nin the sand with his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his weakness.\\nBut he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it.\\nHe erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them.\\nBut Joe\\'s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection.\\nHe was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it.\\nThe tears lay very near the surface.\\nHuck was melancholy, too.\\nTom was downhearted, but tried hard not to show it.\\nHe had a secret which he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out.\\nHe said, with a great show of cheerfulness:  \"I bet there\\'s been pirates on this island before, boys.\\nWe\\'ll explore it again.\\nThey\\'ve hid treasures here somewhere.\\nHow\\'d you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?\"\\nBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.\\nTom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too.\\nIt was discouraging work.\\nJoe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy.\\nFinally he said:  \"Oh, boys, let\\'s give it up.\\nI want to go home.\\nIt\\'s so lonesome.\"\\n\"Oh no, Joe, you\\'ll feel better by and by.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"Just think of the fishing that\\'s here.\"\\n\"I don\\'t care for fishing.\\nI want to go home.\"\\n\"But, Joe, there ain\\'t such another swimming-place anywhere.\"\\n\"Swimming\\'s no good.\\nI don\\'t seem to care for it, somehow, when there ain\\'t anybody to say I sha\\'n\\'t go in.\\nI mean to go home.\"\\n\"Oh, shucks!\\nBaby!\\nYou want to see your mother, I reckon.\"\\n\"Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one.\\nI ain\\'t any more baby than you are.\"\\nAnd Joe snuffled a little.\\n\"Well, we\\'ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won\\'t we, Huck?\\nPoor thing--does it want to see its mother?\\nAnd so it shall.\\nYou like it here, don\\'t you, Huck?\\nWe\\'ll stay, won\\'t we?\"\\nHuck said, \"Y-e-s\"--without any heart in it.\\n\"I\\'ll never speak to you again as long as I live.\"\\nsaid Joe, rising.\\n\"There now.\"\\nAnd he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\\n\"Who cares.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"Nobody wants you to.\\nGo \\'long home and get laughed at.\\nOh, you\\'re a nice pirate.\\nHuck and me ain\\'t crybabies.\\nWe\\'ll stay, won\\'t we, Huck?\\nLet him go if he wants to.\\nI reckon we can get along without him, per\\'aps.\"\\nBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on with his dressing.\\nAnd then it was discomforting to see Huck eying Joe\\'s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.\\nPresently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore.\\nTom\\'s heart began to sink.\\nHe glanced at Huck.\\nHuck could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes.\\nThen he said:  \"I want to go, too, Tom.\\nIt was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it\\'ll be worse.\\nLet\\'s us go, too, Tom.\"\\n\"I won\\'t!\\nYou can all go, if you want to.\\nI mean to stay.\"\\n\"Tom, I better go.\"\\n\"Well, go \\'long--who\\'s hendering you.\"\\nHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes.\\nHe said:  \"Tom, I wisht you\\'d come, too.\\nNow you think it over.\\nWe\\'ll wait for you when we get to shore.\"\\n\"Well, you\\'ll wait a blame long time, that\\'s all.\"\\nHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too.\\nHe hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on.\\nIt suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still.\\nHe made one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades, yelling:  \"Wait!\\nWait!\\nI want to tell you something.\"\\nThey presently stopped and turned around.\\nWhen he got to where they were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at last they saw the \"poin.\"\\nhe was driving at, and then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was \"splendid.\"\\nand said if he had told them at first, they wouldn\\'t have started away.\\nHe made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.\\nThe lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will, chattering all the time about Tom\\'s stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it.\\nAfter a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke, now.\\nJoe caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too.\\nSo Huck made pipes and filled them.\\nThese novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they \"bi.\"\\nthe tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, and with slender confidence.\\nThe smoke had an unpleasant taste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:  \"Why, it\\'s just as easy!\\nIf I\\'d a knowed this was all, I\\'d a learnt long ago.\"\\n\"So would I.\"\\nsaid Joe.\\n\"It\\'s just nothing.\"\\n\"Why, many a time I\\'ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"That\\'s just the way with me, hain\\'t it, Huck?\\nYou\\'ve heard me talk just that way--haven\\'t you, Huck?\\nI\\'ll leave it to Huck if I haven\\'t.\"\\n\"Yes--heaps of times.\"\\nsaid Huck.\\n\"Well, I have too.\"\\nsaid Tom; \"oh, hundreds of times.\\nOnce down by the slaughter-house.\\nDon\\'t you remember, Huck?\\nBob Tanner was there, and Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it.\\nDon\\'t you remember, Huck, \\'bout me saying that?\"\\n\"Yes, that\\'s so.\"\\nsaid Huck.\\n\"That was the day after I lost a white alley.\\nNo, \\'twas the day before.\"\\n\"There--I told you so.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"Huck recollects it.\"\\n\"I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day.\"\\nsaid Joe.\\n\"I don\\'t feel sick.\"\\n\"Neither do I.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"I could smoke it all day.\\nBut I bet you Jeff Thatcher couldn\\'t.\"\\n\"Jeff Thatcher!\\nWhy, he\\'d keel over just with two draws.\\nJust let him try it once.\\n_He\\'d_ see.\"\\n\"I bet he would.\\nAnd Johnny Miller--I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle it once.\"\\n\"Oh, don\\'t I.\"\\nsaid Joe.\\n\"Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn\\'t any more do this than nothing.\\nJust one little snifter would fetch _him_.\"\\n\"\\'Deed it would, Joe.\\nSay--I wish the boys could see us now.\"\\n\"So do I.\"\\n\"Say--boys, don\\'t say anything about it, and some time when they\\'re around, I\\'ll come up to you and say, \\'Joe, got a pipe?\\nI want a smoke.\\' And you\\'ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn\\'t anything, you\\'ll say, \\'Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain\\'t very good.\\' And I\\'ll say, \\'Oh, that\\'s all right, if it\\'s _strong_ enough.\\' And then you\\'ll out with the pipes, and we\\'ll light up just as ca\\'m, and then just see \\'em look.\"\\n\"By jings, that\\'ll be gay, Tom!\\nI wish it was _now_.\"\\n\"So do I!\\nAnd when we tell \\'em we learned when we was off pirating, won\\'t they wish they\\'d been along?\"\\n\"Oh, I reckon not!\\nI\\'ll just _bet_ they will.\"\\nSo the talk ran on.\\nBut presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow disjointed.\\nThe silences widened; the expectoration marvellously increased.\\nEvery pore inside the boys\\' cheeks became a spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings followed every time.\\nBoth boys were looking very pale and miserable, now.\\nJoe\\'s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers.\\nTom\\'s followed.\\nBoth fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main.\\nJoe said feebly:  \"I\\'ve lost my knife.\\nI reckon I better go and find it.\"\\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:  \"I\\'ll help you.\\nYou go over that way and I\\'ll hunt around by the spring.\\nNo, you needn\\'t come, Huck--we can find it.\"\\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour.\\nThen he found it lonesome, and went to find his comrades.\\nThey were wide apart in the woods, both very pale, both fast asleep.\\nBut something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it.\\nThey were not talkative at supper that night.\\nThey had a humble look, and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well--something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them.\\nAbout midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys.\\nThere was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something.\\nThe boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling.\\nThey sat still, intent and waiting.\\nThe solemn hush continued.\\nBeyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness.\\nPresently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished.\\nBy and by another came, a little stronger.\\nThen another.\\nThen a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by.\\nThere was a pause.\\nNow a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet.\\nAnd it showed three white, startled faces, too.\\nA deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance.\\nA sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire.\\nAnother fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops right over the boys\\' heads.\\nThey clung together in terror, in the thick gloom that followed.\\nA few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.\\n\"Quick!\\nboys, go for the tent.\"\\nexclaimed Tom.\\nThey sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no two plunging in the same direction.\\nA furious blast roared through the trees, making everything sing as it went.\\nOne blinding flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder.\\nAnd now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground.\\nThe boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly.\\nHowever, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for.\\nThey could not talk, the old sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them.\\nThe tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast.\\nThe boys seized each others\\' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank.\\nNow the battle was at its highest.\\nUnder the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain.\\nEvery little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling.\\nThe storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment.\\nIt was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.\\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway.\\nThe boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.\\nEverything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain.\\nHere was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled.\\nThey were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again.\\nThen they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were gladhearted once more.\\nThey dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.\\nAs the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep.\\nThey got scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast.\\nAfter the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once more.\\nTom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could.\\nBut they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything.\\nHe reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer.\\nWhile it lasted, he got them interested in a new device.\\nThis was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.\\nThey were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras--all of them chiefs, of course--and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.\\nBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each other by thousands.\\nIt was a gory day.\\nConsequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.\\nThey assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now a difficulty arose--hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace.\\nThere was no other process that ever they had heard of.\\nTwo of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates.\\nHowever, there was no other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in due form.\\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable.\\nThey were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort.\\nNo, they practised cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening.\\nThey were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations.\\nWe will leave them to smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at present.\\nThe Harpers, and Aunt Polly\\'s family, were being put into mourning, with great grief and many tears.\\nAn unusual quiet possessed the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.\\nThe villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked little; but they sighed often.\\nThe Saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children.\\nThey had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them up.\\nIn the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy.\\nBut she found nothing there to comfort her.\\nShe soliloquized:  \"Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again!\\nBut I haven\\'t got anything now to remember him by.\"\\nAnd she choked back a little sob.\\nPresently she stopped, and said to herself:  \"It was right here.\\nOh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn\\'t say that--I wouldn\\'t say it for the whole world.\\nBut he\\'s gone now; I\\'ll never, never, never see him any more.\"\\nThis thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling down her cheeks.\\nThen quite a group of boys and girls--playmates of Tom\\'s and Joe\\'s--came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful prophecy, as they could easily see now!)--and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added something like \"and I was a-standing just so--just as I am now, and as if you was him--I was as close as that--and he smiled, just this way--and then something seemed to go all over me, like--awful, you know--and I never thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now.\"\\nThen there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided who _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them, the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and envied by all the rest.\\nOne poor chap, who had no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance:  \"Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.\"\\nBut that bid for glory was a failure.\\nMost of the boys could say that, and so that cheapened the distinction too much.\\nThe group loitered away, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.\\nWhen the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way.\\nIt was a very still Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature.\\nThe villagers began to gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event.\\nBut there was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there.\\nNone could remember when the little church had been so full before.\\nThere was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.\\nThere was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed.\\nA moving hymn was sung, and the text followed: \"I am the Resurrection and the Life.\"\\nAs the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor boys.\\nThe minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide.\\nThe congregation became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and crying in the pulpit.\\nThere was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed!\\nFirst one and then another pair of eyes followed the minister\\'s, and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags, sneaking sheepishly in the rear!\\nThey had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon!\\nAunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes.\\nHe wavered, and started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:  \"Aunt Polly, it ain\\'t fair.\\nSomebody\\'s got to be glad to see Huck.\"\\n\"And so they shall.\\nI\\'m glad to see him, poor motherless thing.\"\\nAnd the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.\\nSuddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: \"Praise God from whom all blessings flow--_sing_!--and put your hearts in it.\"\\nAnd they did.\\nOld Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest moment of his life.\\nAs the \"sol.\"\\ncongregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that once more.\\nTom got more cuffs and kisses that day--according to Aunt Polly\\'s varying moods--than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.\\nThey had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches.\\nAt breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to Tom, and very attentive to his wants.\\nThere was an unusual amount of talk.\\nIn the course of it Aunt Polly said:  \"Well, I don\\'t say it wasn\\'t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody suffering \\'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so.\\nIf you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn\\'t dead, but only run off.\"\\n\"Yes, you could have done that, Tom.\"\\nsaid Mary; \"and I believe you would if you had thought of it.\"\\n\"Would you, Tom?\"\\nsaid Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully.\\n\"Say, now, would you, if you\\'d thought of it?\"\\n\"I--well, I don\\'t know.\\n\\'Twould \\'a\\' spoiled everything.\"\\n\"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much.\"\\nsaid Aunt Polly, with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy.\\n\"It would have been something if you\\'d cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn\\'t _do_ it.\"\\n\"Now, auntie, that ain\\'t any harm.\"\\npleaded Mary; \"it\\'s only Tom\\'s giddy way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.\"\\n\"More\\'s the pity.\\nSid would have thought.\\nAnd Sid would have come and _done_ it, too.\\nTom, you\\'ll look back, some day, when it\\'s too late, and wish you\\'d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little.\"\\n\"Now, auntie, you know I do care for you.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"I\\'d know it better if you acted more like it.\"\\n\"I wish now I\\'d thought.\"\\nsaid Tom, with a repentant tone; \"but I dreamt about you, anyway.\\nThat\\'s something, ain\\'t it?\"\\n\"It ain\\'t much--a cat does that much--but it\\'s better than nothing.\\nWhat did you dream?\"\\n\"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.\"\\n\"Well, so we did.\\nSo we always do.\\nI\\'m glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us.\"\\n\"And I dreamt that Joe Harper\\'s mother was here.\"\\n\"Why, she was here!\\nDid you dream any more?\"\\n\"Oh, lots.\\nBut it\\'s so dim, now.\"\\n\"Well, try to recollect--can\\'t you?\"\\n\"Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the-.\"\\n\"Try harder, Tom!\\nThe wind did blow something.\\nCome.\"\\nTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then said:  \"I\\'ve got it now!\\nI\\'ve got it now!\\nIt blowed the candle.\"\\n\"Mercy on us!\\nGo on, Tom--go on.\"\\n\"And it seems to me that you said, \\'Why, I believe that that door--.\"\\n\"Go _on_, Tom.\"\\n\"Just let me study a moment--just a moment.\\nOh, yes--you said you believed the door was open.\"\\n\"As I\\'m sitting here, I did!\\nDidn\\'t I, Mary!\\nGo on.\"\\n\"And then--and then--well I won\\'t be certain, but it seems like as if you made Sid go and--and-.\"\\n\"Well?\\nWell?\\nWhat did I make him do, Tom?\\nWhat did I make him do?\"\\n\"You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.\"\\n\"Well, for the land\\'s sake!\\nI never heard the beat of that in all my days!\\nDon\\'t tell _me_ there ain\\'t anything in dreams, any more.\\nSereny Harper shall know of this before I\\'m an hour older.\\nI\\'d like to see her get around _this_ with her rubbage \\'bout superstition.\\nGo on, Tom.\"\\n\"Oh, it\\'s all getting just as bright as day, now.\\nNext you said I warn\\'t _bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible than--than--I think it was a colt, or something.\"\\n\"And so it was!\\nWell, goodness gracious!\\nGo on, Tom.\"\\n\"And then you began to cry.\"\\n\"So I did.\\nSo I did.\\nNot the first time, neither.\\nAnd then-.\"\\n\"Then Mrs.\\nHarper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and she wished she hadn\\'t whipped him for taking cream when she\\'d throwed it out her own self-.\"\\n\"Tom!\\nThe sperrit was upon you!\\nYou was a prophesying--that\\'s what you was doing!\\nLand alive, go on, Tom.\"\\n\"Then Sid he said--he said-.\"\\n\"I don\\'t think I said anything.\"\\nsaid Sid.\\n\"Yes you did, Sid.\"\\nsaid Mary.\\n\"Shut your heads and let Tom go on!\\nWhat did he say, Tom?\"\\n\"He said--I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to, but if I\\'d been better sometimes-.\"\\n\"_There_, d\\'you hear that!\\nIt was his very words.\"\\n\"And you shut him up sharp.\"\\n\"I lay I did!\\nThere must \\'a\\' been an angel there.\\nThere _was_ an angel there, somewheres.\"\\n\"And Mrs.\\nHarper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you told about Peter and the Pain-killer-.\"\\n\"Just as true as I live.\"\\n\"And then there was a whole lot of talk \\'bout dragging the river for us, and \\'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went.\"\\n\"It happened just so!\\nIt happened just so, as sure as I\\'m a-sitting in these very tracks.\\nTom, you couldn\\'t told it more like if you\\'d \\'a\\' seen it!\\nAnd then what?\\nGo on, Tom.\"\\n\"Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every word you said.\\nAnd you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, \\'We ain\\'t dead--we are only off being pirates,\\' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips.\"\\n\"Did you, Tom, _did_ you!\\nI just forgive you everything for that.\"\\nAnd she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains.\\n\"It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream.\"\\nSid soliloquized just audibly.\\n\"Shut up, Sid!\\nA body does just the same in a dream as he\\'d do if he was awake.\\nHere\\'s a big Milum apple I\\'ve been saving for you, Tom, if you was ever found again--now go \\'long to school.\\nI\\'m thankful to the good God and Father of us all I\\'ve got you back, that\\'s long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows I\\'m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there\\'s few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.\\nGo \\'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you\\'ve hendered me long enough.\"\\nThe children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs.\\nHarper and vanquish her realism with Tom\\'s marvellous dream.\\nSid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house.\\nIt was this: \"Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any mistakes in it.\"\\nWhat a hero Tom was become, now!\\nHe did not go skipping and prancing, but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye was on him.\\nAnd indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and drink to him.\\nSmaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town.\\nBoys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless.\\nThey would have given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a circus.\\nAt school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not long in becoming insufferably \"stuck-up.\"\\nThey began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish material.\\nAnd finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.\\nTom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now.\\nGlory was sufficient.\\nHe would live for glory.\\nNow that he was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to \"make up.\"\\nWell, let her--she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people.\\nPresently she arrived.\\nTom pretended not to see her.\\nHe moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk.\\nSoon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too.\\nIt gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only \"set him u.\"\\nthe more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about.\\nPresently she gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom.\\nThen she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else.\\nShe felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once.\\nShe tried to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead.\\nShe said to a girl almost at Tom\\'s elbow--with sham vivacity:  \"Why, Mary Austin!\\nyou bad girl, why didn\\'t you come to Sunday-school?\"\\n\"I did come--didn\\'t you see me?\"\\n\"Why, no!\\nDid you?\\nWhere did you sit?\"\\n\"I was in Miss Peters\\' class, where I always go.\\nI saw _you_.\"\\n\"Did you?\\nWhy, it\\'s funny I didn\\'t see you.\\nI wanted to tell you about the picnic.\"\\n\"Oh, that\\'s jolly.\\nWho\\'s going to give it?\"\\n\"My ma\\'s going to let me have one.\"\\n\"Oh, goody; I hope she\\'ll let _me_ come.\"\\n\"Well, she will.\\nThe picnic\\'s for me.\\nShe\\'ll let anybody come that I want, and I want you.\"\\n\"That\\'s ever so nice.\\nWhen is it going to be?\"\\n\"By and by.\\nMaybe about vacation.\"\\n\"Oh, won\\'t it be fun!\\nYou going to have all the girls and boys?\"\\n\"Yes, every one that\\'s friends to me--or wants to be\"; and she glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree \"all to flinder.\"\\nwhile he was \"standing within three feet of it.\"\\n\"Oh, may I come?\"\\nsaid Grace Miller.\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"And me?\"\\nsaid Sally Rogers.\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"And me, too?\"\\nsaid Susy Harper.\\n\"And Joe?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy.\\nThen Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and took Amy with him.\\nBecky\\'s lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call \"a good cry.\"\\nThen she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang.\\nShe roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what _she\\'d_ do.\\nAt recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self-satisfaction.\\nAnd he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance.\\nAt last he spied her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury.\\nShe was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.\\nJealousy ran red-hot through Tom\\'s veins.\\nHe began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation.\\nHe called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of.\\nHe wanted to cry with vexation.\\nAmy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom\\'s tongue had lost its function.\\nHe did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise.\\nHe kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there.\\nHe could not help it.\\nAnd it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living.\\nBut she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\\nAmy\\'s happy prattle became intolerable.\\nTom hinted at things he had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting.\\nBut in vain--the girl chirped on.\\nTom thought, \"Oh, hang her, ain\\'t I ever going to get rid of her?\"\\nAt last he must be attending to those things--and she said artlessly that she would be \"aroun.\"\\nwhen school let out.\\nAnd he hastened away, hating her for it.\\n\"Any other boy.\"\\nTom thought, grating his teeth.\\n\"Any boy in the whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy!\\nOh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this town, mister, and I\\'ll lick you again!\\nYou just wait till I catch you out!\\nI\\'ll just take and-.\"\\nAnd he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy--pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging.\\n\"Oh, you do, do you?\\nYou holler \\'nough, do you?\\nNow, then, let that learn you.\"\\nAnd so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.\\nTom fled home at noon.\\nHis conscience could not endure any more of Amy\\'s grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress.\\nBecky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came.\\nAt last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn\\'t carried it so far.\\nWhen poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept exclaiming: \"Oh, here\\'s a jolly one!\\nlook at this.\"\\nshe lost patience at last, and said, \"Oh, don\\'t bother me!\\nI don\\'t care for them.\"\\nand burst into tears, and got up and walked away.\\nAlfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she said:  \"Go away and leave me alone, can\\'t you!\\nI hate you.\"\\nSo the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on, crying.\\nThen Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse.\\nHe was humiliated and angry.\\nHe easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.\\nHe was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.\\nHe wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself.\\nTom\\'s spelling-book fell under his eye.\\nHere was his opportunity.\\nHe gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page.\\nBecky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act, and moved on, without discovering herself.\\nShe started homeward, now, intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their troubles would be healed.\\nBefore she was half way home, however, she had changed her mind.\\nThe thought of Tom\\'s treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.\\nShe resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book\\'s account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.\\n\"Auntie, what have I done?\"\\n\"Well, you\\'ve done enough.\\nHere I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old softy, expecting I\\'m going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she\\'d found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night.\\nTom, I don\\'t know what is to become of a boy that will act like that.\\nIt makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word.\"\\nThis was a new aspect of the thing.\\nHis smartness of the morning had seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious.\\nIt merely looked mean and shabby now.\\nHe hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment.\\nThen he said:  \"Auntie, I wish I hadn\\'t done it--but I didn\\'t think.\"\\n\"Oh, child, you never think.\\nYou never think of anything but your own selfishness.\\nYou could think to come all the way over here from Jackson\\'s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn\\'t ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow.\"\\n\"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn\\'t mean to be mean.\\nI didn\\'t, honest.\\nAnd besides, I didn\\'t come over here to laugh at you that night.\"\\n\"What did you come for, then?\"\\n\"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn\\'t got drownded.\"\\n\"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never did--and I know it, Tom.\"\\n\"Indeed and \\'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn\\'t.\"\\n\"Oh, Tom, don\\'t lie--don\\'t do it.\\nIt only makes things a hundred times worse.\"\\n\"It ain\\'t a lie, auntie; it\\'s the truth.\\nI wanted to keep you from grieving--that was all that made me come.\"\\n\"I\\'d give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power of sins, Tom.\\nI\\'d \\'most be glad you\\'d run off and acted so bad.\\nBut it ain\\'t reasonable; because, why didn\\'t you tell me, child?\"\\n\"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn\\'t somehow bear to spoil it.\\nSo I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum.\"\\n\"What bark?\"\\n\"The bark I had wrote on to tell you we\\'d gone pirating.\\nI wish, now, you\\'d waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest.\"\\nThe hard lines in his aunt\\'s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes.\\n\"_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?\"\\n\"Why, yes, I did.\"\\n\"Are you sure you did, Tom?\"\\n\"Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure.\"\\n\"What did you kiss me for, Tom?\"\\n\"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.\"\\nThe words sounded like truth.\\nThe old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said:  \"Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don\\'t bother me any more.\"\\nThe moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in.\\nThen she stopped, with it in her hand, and said to herself:  \"No, I don\\'t dare.\\nPoor boy, I reckon he\\'s lied about it--but it\\'s a blessed, blessed lie, there\\'s such a comfort come from it.\\nI hope the Lord--I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such good-heartedness in him to tell it.\\nBut I don\\'t want to find out it\\'s a lie.\\nI won\\'t look.\"\\nShe put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute.\\nTwice she put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained.\\nOnce more she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought: \"It\\'s a good lie--it\\'s a good lie--I won\\'t let it grieve me.\"\\nSo she sought the jacket pocket.\\nA moment later she was reading Tom\\'s piece of bark through flowing tears and saying: \"I could forgive the boy, now, if he\\'d committed a million sins.\"\\nHe started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane.\\nHis mood always determined his manner.\\nWithout a moment\\'s hesitation he ran to her and said:  \"I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I\\'m so sorry.\\nI won\\'t ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won\\'t you?\"\\nThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:  \"I\\'ll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr.\\nThomas Sawyer.\\nI\\'ll never speak to you again.\"\\nShe tossed her head and passed on.\\nTom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say \"Who cares, Miss Smarty?\"\\nuntil the right time to say it had gone by.\\nSo he said nothing.\\nBut he was in a fine rage, nevertheless.\\nHe moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were.\\nHe presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed.\\nShe hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete.\\nIt seemed to Becky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to \"take in.\"\\nshe was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.\\nIf she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom\\'s offensive fling had driven it entirely away.\\nPoor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.\\nThe master, Mr.\\nDobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition.\\nThe darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster.\\nEvery day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting.\\nHe kept that book under lock and key.\\nThere was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came.\\nEvery boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.\\nNow, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she noticed that the key was in the lock!\\nIt was a precious moment.\\nShe glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the book in her hands.\\nThe titlepage--Professor Somebody\\'s _Anatomy_--carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves.\\nShe came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece--a human figure, stark naked.\\nAt that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture.\\nBecky snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle.\\nShe thrust the volume into the desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.\\n\"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person and look at what they\\'re looking at.\"\\n\"How could I know you was looking at anything?\"\\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you\\'re going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do!\\nI\\'ll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school.\"\\nThen she stamped her little foot and said:  \"_Be_ so mean if you want to!\\nI know something that\\'s going to happen.\\nYou just wait and you\\'ll see!\\nHateful, hateful, hateful!\"--and she flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.\\nTom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught.\\nPresently he said to himself:  \"What a curious kind of a fool a girl is!\\nNever been licked in school!\\nShucks!\\nWhat\\'s a licking!\\nThat\\'s just like a girl--they\\'re so thin-skinned and chicken-hearted.\\nWell, of course I ain\\'t going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool, because there\\'s other ways of getting even on her, that ain\\'t so mean; but what of it?\\nOld Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book.\\nNobody\\'ll answer.\\nThen he\\'ll do just the way he always does--ask first one and then t\\'other, and when he comes to the right girl he\\'ll know it, without any telling.\\nGirls\\' faces always tell on them.\\nThey ain\\'t got any backbone.\\nShe\\'ll get licked.\\nWell, it\\'s a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain\\'t any way out of it.\"\\nTom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: \"All right, though; she\\'d like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it out.\"\\nTom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside.\\nIn a few moments the master arrived and school \"took in.\"\\nTom did not feel a strong interest in his studies.\\nEvery time he stole a glance at the girls\\' side of the room Becky\\'s face troubled him.\\nConsidering all things, he did not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it.\\nHe could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name.\\nPresently the spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom\\'s mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that.\\nBecky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings.\\nShe did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right.\\nThe denial only seemed to make the thing worse for Tom.\\nBecky supposed she would be glad of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she was not certain.\\nWhen the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still--because, said she to herself, \"he\\'ll tell about me tearing the picture sure.\\nI wouldn\\'t say a word, not to save his life.\"\\nTom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he had denied it for form\\'s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck to the denial from principle.\\nA whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air was drowsy with the hum of study.\\nBy and by, Mr.\\nDobbins straightened himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it.\\nMost of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes.\\nMr.\\nDobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!\\nTom shot a glance at Becky.\\nHe had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head.\\nInstantly he forgot his quarrel with her.\\nQuick--something must be done!\\ndone in a flash, too!\\nBut the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.\\nGood!--he had an inspiration!\\nHe would run and snatch the book, spring through the door and fly.\\nBut his resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume.\\nIf Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again!\\nToo late.\\nThere was no help for Becky now, he said.\\nThe next moment the master faced the school.\\nEvery eye sank under his gaze.\\nThere was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear.\\nThere was silence while one might count ten--the master was gathering his wrath.\\nThen he spoke: \"Who tore this book?\"\\nThere was not a sound.\\nOne could have heard a pin drop.\\nThe stillness continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\\n\"Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?\"\\nA denial.\\nAnother pause.\\n\"Joseph Harper, did you?\"\\nAnother denial.\\nTom\\'s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow torture of these proceedings.\\nThe master scanned the ranks of boys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:  \"Amy Lawrence?\"\\nA shake of the head.\\n\"Gracie Miller?\"\\nThe same sign.\\n\"Susan Harper, did you do this?\"\\nAnother negative.\\nThe next girl was Becky Thatcher.\\nTom was trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the situation.\\n\"Rebecca Thatche.\"\\n[Tom glanced at her face--it was white with terror]--\"did you tear--no, look me in the fac.\"\\n[her hands rose in appeal]--\"did you tear this book?\"\\nA thought shot like lightning through Tom\\'s brain.\\nHe sprang to his feet and shouted--\"I done it.\"\\nThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly.\\nTom stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky\\'s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings.\\nInspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr.\\nDobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either.\\nTom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky\\'s latest words lingering dreamily in his ear--  \"Tom, how _could_ you be so noble.\"\\nThe schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on \"Examinatio.\"\\nday.\\nHis rod and his ferule were seldom idle now--at least among the smaller pupils.\\nOnly the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing.\\nMr.\\nDobbins\\' lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle.\\nAs the great day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings.\\nThe consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge.\\nThey threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief.\\nBut he kept ahead all the time.\\nThe retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted.\\nAt last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.\\nThey swore in the signpainter\\'s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help.\\nHe had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father\\'s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.\\nThe master\\'s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the signpainter\\'s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would \"manage the thin.\"\\nwhile he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.\\nIn the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived.\\nAt eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers.\\nThe master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.\\nHe was looking tolerably mellow.\\nThree rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils.\\nTo his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort; rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers\\' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair.\\nAll the rest of the house was filled with non-participating scholars.\\nThe exercises began.\\nA very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, \"You\\'d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage.\"\\netc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order.\\nBut he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired.\\nA little shamefaced girl lisped, \"Mary had a little lamb.\"\\netc., performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat down flushed and happy.\\nTom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible \"Give me liberty or give me deat.\"\\nspeech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of it.\\nA ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke.\\nTrue, he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house\\'s silence, too, which was even worse than its sympathy.\\nThe master frowned, and this completed the disaster.\\nTom struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated.\\nThere was a weak attempt at applause, but it died early.\\n\"The Boy Stood on the Burning Dec.\"\\nfollowed; also \"The Assyrian Came Down.\"\\nand other declamatory gems.\\nThen there were reading exercises, and a spelling fight.\\nThe meagre Latin class recited with honor.\\nThe prime feature of the evening was in order, now--original \"composition.\"\\nby the young ladies.\\nEach in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to \"expressio.\"\\nand punctuation.\\nThe themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades.\\n\"Friendshi.\"\\nwas one; \"Memories of Other Days\"; \"Religion in History\"; \"Dream Land\"; \"The Advantages of Culture\"; \"Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted\"; \"Melancholy\"; \"Filial Love\"; \"Heart Longings.\"\\netc., etc.\\nA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of \"fine language\"; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them.\\nNo matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification.\\nThe glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps.\\nThere is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious.\\nBut enough of this.\\nHomely truth is unpalatable.\\nLet us return to the \"Examination.\"\\nThe first composition that was read was one entitled \"Is this, then, Life?\"\\nPerhaps the reader can endure an extract from it:  \"In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!\\nImagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy.\\nIn fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, \\'the observed of all observers.\\' Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.\\n\"In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright dreams.\\nHow fairy-like does everything appear to her enchanted vision!\\nEach new scene is more charming than the last.\\nBut after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul.\"\\nAnd so forth and so on.\\nThere was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of \"How sweet.\"\\n\"How eloquent.\"\\n\"So true.\"\\netc., and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the \"interestin.\"\\npaleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a \"poem.\"\\nTwo stanzas of it will do:  \"A MISSOURI MAIDEN\\'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA  \"Alabama, goodbye!\\nI love thee well!\\nBut yet for a while do I leave thee now!\\nSad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell, And burning recollections throng my brow!\\nFor I have wandered through thy flowery woods; Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa\\'s stream; Have listened to Tallassee\\'s warring floods, And wooed on Coosa\\'s side Aurora\\'s beam.\\n\"Yet shame I not to bear an o\\'erfull heart, Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes; \\'Tis from no stranger land I now must part, \\'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\\nWelcome and home were mine within this State, Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete, When, dear Alabama!\\nthey turn cold on thee.\"\\nThere were very few there who knew what \"tet.\"\\nmeant, but the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.\\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:  \"A VISION  \"Dark and tempestuous was night.\\nAround the throne on high not a single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin!\\nEven the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.\\n\"At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,  \"\\'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide--My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,\\' came to my side.\\nShe moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy\\'s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness.\\nSo soft was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away unperceived--unsought.\\nA strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.\"\\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize.\\nThis composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening.\\nThe mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most \"eloquen.\"\\nthing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.\\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which the word \"beauteou.\"\\nwas over-fondled, and human experience referred to as \"life\\'s page.\"\\nwas up to the usual average.\\nNow the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon.\\nBut he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house.\\nHe knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it.\\nHe sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced.\\nHe threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth.\\nHe felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased.\\nAnd well it might.\\nThere was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air.\\nThe tittering rose higher and higher--the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher\\'s head--down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession!\\nAnd how the light did blaze abroad from the master\\'s bald pate--for the signpainter\\'s boy had _gilded_ it!\\nThat broke up the meeting.\\nThe boys were avenged.\\nVacation had come.\\nNOTE:--The pretended \"composition.\"\\nquoted in this chapter are taken without alteration from a volume entitled \"Prose and Poetry, by a Western Lady\"--but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.\\nHe promised to abstain from smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member.\\nNow he found out a new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing.\\nTom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order.\\nFourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up--gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.\\nDuring three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge\\'s condition and hungry for news of it.\\nSometimes his hopes ran high--so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass.\\nBut the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.\\nAt last he was pronounced upon the mend--and then convalescent.\\nTom was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too.\\nHe handed in his resignation at once--and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died.\\nTom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.\\nThe funeral was a fine thing.\\nThe Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy.\\nTom was a free boy again, however--there was something in that.\\nHe could drink and swear, now--but found to his surprise that he did not want to.\\nThe simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.\\nTom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands.\\nHe attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so he abandoned it.\\nThe first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a sensation.\\nTom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy for two days.\\nEven the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr.\\nBenton, an actual United States Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.\\nA circus came.\\nThe boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag carpeting--admission, three pins for boys, two for girls--and then circusing was abandoned.\\nA phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever.\\nThere were some boys-and-girls\\' parties, but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.\\nBecky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her parents during vacation--so there was no bright side to life anywhere.\\nThe dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery.\\nIt was a very cancer for permanency and pain.\\nThen came the measles.\\nDuring two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its happenings.\\nHe was very ill, he was interested in nothing.\\nWhen he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature.\\nThere had been a \"revival.\"\\nand everybody had \"got religion.\"\\nnot only the adults, but even the boys and girls.\\nTom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere.\\nHe found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle.\\nHe sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts.\\nHe hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning.\\nEvery boy he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost, forever and forever.\\nAnd that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning.\\nHe covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.\\nHe believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result.\\nIt might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself.\\nBy and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object.\\nThe boy\\'s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform.\\nHis second was to wait--for there might not be any more storms.\\nThe next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed.\\nThe three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age.\\nWhen he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was.\\nHe drifted listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her victim, a bird.\\nHe found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon.\\nPoor lads!\\nthey--like Tom--had suffered a relapse.\\nIt became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately.\\nTom could not get away from it.\\nEvery reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as \"feelers\"; he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip.\\nIt kept him in a cold shiver all the time.\\nHe took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him.\\nIt would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer.\\nMoreover, he wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.\\n\"Huck, have you ever told anybody about--that?\"\\n\"\\'Bout what?\"\\n\"You know what.\"\\n\"Oh--\\'course I haven\\'t.\"\\n\"Never a word?\"\\n\"Never a solitary word, so help me.\\nWhat makes you ask?\"\\n\"Well, I was afeard.\"\\n\"Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn\\'t be alive two days if that got found out.\\n_You_ know that.\"\\nTom felt more comfortable.\\nAfter a pause:  \"Huck, they couldn\\'t anybody get you to tell, could they?\"\\n\"Get me to tell?\\nWhy, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell.\\nThey ain\\'t no different way.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s all right, then.\\nI reckon we\\'re safe as long as we keep mum.\\nBut let\\'s swear again, anyway.\\nIt\\'s more surer.\"\\n\"I\\'m agreed.\"\\nSo they swore again with dread solemnities.\\n\"What is the talk around, Huck?\\nI\\'ve heard a power of it.\"\\n\"Talk?\\nWell, it\\'s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the time.\\nIt keeps me in a sweat, constant, so\\'s I want to hide som\\'ers.\"\\n\"That\\'s just the same way they go on round me.\\nI reckon he\\'s a goner.\\nDon\\'t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?\"\\n\"Most always--most always.\\nHe ain\\'t no account; but then he hain\\'t ever done anything to hurt anybody.\\nJust fishes a little, to get money to get drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do that--leastways most of us--preachers and such like.\\nBut he\\'s kind of good--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn\\'t enough for two; and lots of times he\\'s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.\"\\n\"Well, he\\'s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.\\nI wish we could get him out of there.\"\\n\"My!\\nwe couldn\\'t get him out, Tom.\\nAnd besides, \\'twouldn\\'t do any good; they\\'d ketch him again.\"\\n\"Yes--so they would.\\nBut I hate to hear \\'em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done--that.\"\\n\"I do too, Tom.\\nLord, I hear \\'em say he\\'s the bloodiest looking villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn\\'t ever hung before.\"\\n\"Yes, they talk like that, all the time.\\nI\\'ve heard \\'em say that if he was to get free they\\'d lynch him.\"\\n\"And they\\'d do it, too.\"\\nThe boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort.\\nAs the twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties.\\nBut nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive.\\nThe boys did as they had often done before--went to the cell grating and gave Potter some tobacco and matches.\\nHe was on the ground floor and there were no guards.\\nHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before--it cut deeper than ever, this time.\\nThey felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:  \"You\\'ve been mighty good to me, boys--better\\'n anybody else in this town.\\nAnd I don\\'t forget it, I don\\'t.\\nOften I says to myself, says I, \\'I used to mend all the boys\\' kites and things, and show \\'em where the good fishin\\' places was, and befriend \\'em what I could, and now they\\'ve all forgot old Muff when he\\'s in trouble; but Tom don\\'t, and Huck don\\'t--_they_ don\\'t forget him, says I, \\'and I don\\'t forget them.\\' Well, boys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that\\'s the only way I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it\\'s right.\\nRight, and _best_, too, I reckon--hope so, anyway.\\nWell, we won\\'t talk about that.\\nI don\\'t want to make _you_ feel bad; you\\'ve befriended me.\\nBut what I want to say, is, don\\'t _you_ ever get drunk--then you won\\'t ever get here.\\nStand a litter furder west--so--that\\'s it; it\\'s a prime comfort to see faces that\\'s friendly when a body\\'s in such a muck of trouble, and there don\\'t none come here but yourn.\\nGood friendly faces--good friendly faces.\\nGit up on one another\\'s backs and let me touch \\'em.\\nThat\\'s it.\\nShake hands--yourn\\'ll come through the bars, but mine\\'s too big.\\nLittle hands, and weak--but they\\'ve helped Muff Potter a power, and they\\'d help him more if they could.\"\\nTom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.\\nThe next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.\\nHuck was having the same experience.\\nThey studiously avoided each other.\\nEach wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently.\\nTom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing news--the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor Potter.\\nAt the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that Injun Joe\\'s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jury\\'s verdict would be.\\nTom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window.\\nHe was in a tremendous state of excitement.\\nIt was hours before he got to sleep.\\nAll the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for this was to be the great day.\\nBoth sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience.\\nAfter a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever.\\nThere was another pause, and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court.\\nThe usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed.\\nThese details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating.\\nNow a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away.\\nAfter some further questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:  \"Take the witness.\"\\nThe prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when his own counsel said:  \"I have no questions to ask him.\"\\nThe next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.\\nCounsel for the prosecution said:  \"Take the witness.\"\\n\"I have no questions to ask him.\"\\nPotter\\'s lawyer replied.\\nA third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter\\'s possession.\\n\"Take the witness.\"\\nCounsel for Potter declined to question him.\\nThe faces of the audience began to betray annoyance.\\nDid this attorney mean to throw away his client\\'s life without an effort?\\nSeveral witnesses deposed concerning Potter\\'s guilty behavior when brought to the scene of the murder.\\nThey were allowed to leave the stand without being cross-questioned.\\nEvery detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined by Potter\\'s lawyer.\\nThe perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.\\nCounsel for the prosecution now said:  \"By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar.\\nWe rest our case here.\"\\nA groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in the courtroom.\\nMany men were moved, and many women\\'s compassion testified itself in tears.\\nCounsel for the defence rose and said:  \"Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink.\\nWe have changed our mind.\\nWe shall not offer that plea.\"\\n[Then to the clerk:] \"Call Thomas Sawyer.\"\\nA puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting Potter\\'s.\\nEvery eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand.\\nThe boy looked wild enough, for he was badly scared.\\nThe oath was administered.\\n\"Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the hour of midnight?\"\\nTom glanced at Injun Joe\\'s iron face and his tongue failed him.\\nThe audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come.\\nAfter a few moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:  \"In the graveyard.\"\\n\"A little bit louder, please.\\nDon\\'t be afraid.\\nYou were-.\"\\n\"In the graveyard.\"\\nA contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe\\'s face.\\n\"Were you anywhere near Horse Williams\\' grave?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"Speak up--just a trifle louder.\\nHow near were you?\"\\n\"Near as I am to you.\"\\n\"Were you hidden, or not?\"\\n\"I was hid.\"\\n\"Where?\"\\n\"Behind the elms that\\'s on the edge of the grave.\"\\nInjun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.\\n\"Any one with you?\"\\n\"Yes, sir.\\nI went there with-.\"\\n\"Wait--wait a moment.\\nNever mind mentioning your companion\\'s name.\\nWe will produce him at the proper time.\\nDid you carry anything there with you.\"\\nTom hesitated and looked confused.\\n\"Speak out, my boy--don\\'t be diffident.\\nThe truth is always respectable.\\nWhat did you take there?\"\\n\"Only a--a--dead cat.\"\\nThere was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.\\n\"We will produce the skeleton of that cat.\\nNow, my boy, tell us everything that occurred--tell it in your own way--don\\'t skip anything, and don\\'t be afraid.\"\\nTom began--hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time, rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale.\\nThe strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said:  \"--and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun Joe jumped with the knife and-.\"\\nCrash!\\nQuick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his way through all opposers, and was gone!\\nHis name even went into immortal print, for the village paper magnified him.\\nThere were some that believed he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.\\nAs usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before.\\nBut that sort of conduct is to the world\\'s credit; therefore it is not well to find fault with it.\\nTom\\'s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights were seasons of horror.\\nInjun Joe infested all his dreams, and always with doom in his eye.\\nHardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall.\\nPoor Huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe\\'s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.\\nThe poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that?\\nSince Tom\\'s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer\\'s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck\\'s confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.\\nDaily Muff Potter\\'s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue.\\nHalf the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the other half he was afraid he would be.\\nHe felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.\\nRewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun Joe was found.\\nOne of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels, a detective, came up from St.\\nLouis, moused around, shook his head, looked wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve.\\nThat is to say, he \"found a clew.\"\\nBut you can\\'t hang a \"cle.\"\\nfor murder, and so after that detective had got through and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.\\nThe slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension.\\nThis desire suddenly came upon Tom one day.\\nHe sallied out to find Joe Harper, but failed of success.\\nNext he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.\\nPresently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed.\\nHuck would answer.\\nTom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially.\\nHuck was willing.\\nHuck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital, for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money.\\n\"Where\\'ll we dig?\"\\nsaid Huck.\\n\"Oh, most anywhere.\"\\n\"Why, is it hid all around?\"\\n\"No, indeed it ain\\'t.\\nIt\\'s hid in mighty particular places, Huck--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha\\'nted houses.\"\\n\"Who hides it?\"\\n\"Why, robbers, of course--who\\'d you reckon?\\nSunday-school sup\\'rintendents?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\\nIf \\'twas mine I wouldn\\'t hide it; I\\'d spend it and have a good time.\"\\n\"So would I.\\nBut robbers don\\'t do that way.\\nThey always hide it and leave it there.\"\\n\"Don\\'t they come after it any more?\"\\n\"No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else they die.\\nAnyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks--a paper that\\'s got to be ciphered over about a week because it\\'s mostly signs and hy\\'roglyphics.\"\\n\"Hyro--which?\"\\n\"Hy\\'roglyphics--pictures and things, you know, that don\\'t seem to mean anything.\"\\n\"Have you got one of them papers, Tom?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Well then, how you going to find the marks?\"\\n\"I don\\'t want any marks.\\nThey always bury it under a ha\\'nted house or on an island, or under a dead tree that\\'s got one limb sticking out.\\nWell, we\\'ve tried Jackson\\'s Island a little, and we can try it again some time; and there\\'s the old ha\\'nted house up the Still-House branch, and there\\'s lots of dead-limb trees--dead loads of \\'em.\"\\n\"Is it under all of them?\"\\n\"How you talk!\\nNo.\"\\n\"Then how you going to know which one to go for?\"\\n\"Go for all of \\'em.\"\\n\"Why, Tom, it\\'ll take all summer.\"\\n\"Well, what of that?\\nSuppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di\\'monds.\\nHow\\'s that?\"\\nHuck\\'s eyes glowed.\\n\"That\\'s bully.\\nPlenty bully enough for me.\\nJust you gimme the hundred dollars and I don\\'t want no di\\'monds.\"\\n\"All right.\\nBut I bet you I ain\\'t going to throw off on di\\'monds.\\nSome of \\'em\\'s worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain\\'t any, hardly, but\\'s worth six bits or a dollar.\"\\n\"No!\\nIs that so?\"\\n\"Cert\\'nly--anybody\\'ll tell you so.\\nHain\\'t you ever seen one, Huck?\"\\n\"Not as I remember.\"\\n\"Oh, kings have slathers of them.\"\\n\"Well, I don\\' know no kings, Tom.\"\\n\"I reckon you don\\'t.\\nBut if you was to go to Europe you\\'d see a raft of \\'em hopping around.\"\\n\"Do they hop?\"\\n\"Hop?--your granny!\\nNo.\"\\n\"Well, what did you say they did, for?\"\\n\"Shucks, I only meant you\\'d _see_ \\'em--not hopping, of course--what do they want to hop for?--but I mean you\\'d just see \\'em--scattered around, you know, in a kind of a general way.\\nLike that old humpbacked Richard.\"\\n\"Richard?\\nWhat\\'s his other name?\"\\n\"He didn\\'t have any other name.\\nKings don\\'t have any but a given name.\"\\n\"No?\"\\n\"But they don\\'t.\"\\n\"Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don\\'t want to be a king and have only just a given name, like a nigger.\\nBut say--where you going to dig first?\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know.\\nS\\'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill t\\'other side of Still-House branch?\"\\n\"I\\'m agreed.\"\\nSo they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their three-mile tramp.\\nThey arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.\\n\"I like this.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"So do I.\"\\n\"Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your share?\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I\\'ll go to every circus that comes along.\\nI bet I\\'ll have a gay time.\"\\n\"Well, ain\\'t you going to save any of it?\"\\n\"Save it?\\nWhat for?\"\\n\"Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.\"\\n\"Oh, that ain\\'t any use.\\nPap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws on it if I didn\\'t hurry up, and I tell you he\\'d clean it out pretty quick.\\nWhat you going to do with yourn, Tom?\"\\n\"I\\'m going to buy a new drum, and a sure\\'nough sword, and a red necktie and a bull pup, and get married.\"\\n\"Married.\"\\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\n\"Tom, you--why, you ain\\'t in your right mind.\"\\n\"Wait--you\\'ll see.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s the foolishest thing you could do.\\nLook at pap and my mother.\\nFight!\\nWhy, they used to fight all the time.\\nI remember, mighty well.\"\\n\"That ain\\'t anything.\\nThe girl I\\'m going to marry won\\'t fight.\"\\n\"Tom, I reckon they\\'re all alike.\\nThey\\'ll all comb a body.\\nNow you better think \\'bout this awhile.\\nI tell you you better.\\nWhat\\'s the name of the gal?\"\\n\"It ain\\'t a gal at all--it\\'s a girl.\"\\n\"It\\'s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl--both\\'s right, like enough.\\nAnyway, what\\'s her name, Tom?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you some time--not now.\"\\n\"All right--that\\'ll do.\\nOnly if you get married I\\'ll be more lonesomer than ever.\"\\n\"No you won\\'t.\\nYou\\'ll come and live with me.\\nNow stir out of this and we\\'ll go to digging.\"\\nThey worked and sweated for half an hour.\\nNo result.\\nThey toiled another halfhour.\\nStill no result.\\nHuck said:  \"Do they always bury it as deep as this?\"\\n\"Sometimes--not always.\\nNot generally.\\nI reckon we haven\\'t got the right place.\"\\nSo they chose a new spot and began again.\\nThe labor dragged a little, but still they made progress.\\nThey pegged away in silence for some time.\\nFinally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve, and said:  \"Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?\"\\n\"I reckon maybe we\\'ll tackle the old tree that\\'s over yonder on Cardiff Hill back of the widow\\'s.\"\\n\"I reckon that\\'ll be a good one.\\nBut won\\'t the widow take it away from us, Tom?\\nIt\\'s on her land.\"\\n\"_She_ take it away!\\nMaybe she\\'d like to try it once.\\nWhoever finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him.\\nIt don\\'t make any difference whose land it\\'s on.\"\\nThat was satisfactory.\\nThe work went on.\\nBy and by Huck said:  \"Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again.\\nWhat do you think?\"\\n\"It is mighty curious, Huck.\\nI don\\'t understand it.\\nSometimes witches interfere.\\nI reckon maybe that\\'s what\\'s the trouble now.\"\\n\"Shucks!\\nWitches ain\\'t got no power in the daytime.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s so.\\nI didn\\'t think of that.\\nOh, I know what the matter is!\\nWhat a blamed lot of fools we are!\\nYou got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that\\'s where you dig.\"\\n\"Then consound it, we\\'ve fooled away all this work for nothing.\\nNow hang it all, we got to come back in the night.\\nIt\\'s an awful long way.\\nCan you get out?\"\\n\"I bet I will.\\nWe\\'ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees these holes they\\'ll know in a minute what\\'s here and they\\'ll go for it.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ll come around and maow tonight.\"\\n\"All right.\\nLet\\'s hide the tools in the bushes.\"\\nThe boys were there that night, about the appointed time.\\nThey sat in the shadow waiting.\\nIt was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old traditions.\\nSpirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note.\\nThe boys were subdued by these solemnities, and talked little.\\nBy and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to dig.\\nTheir hopes commenced to rise.\\nTheir interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it.\\nThe hole deepened and still deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something, they only suffered a new disappointment.\\nIt was only a stone or a chunk.\\nAt last Tom said:  \"It ain\\'t any use, Huck, we\\'re wrong again.\"\\n\"Well, but we _can\\'t_ be wrong.\\nWe spotted the shadder to a dot.\"\\n\"I know it, but then there\\'s another thing.\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\".\\n\"Why, we only guessed at the time.\\nLike enough it was too late or too early.\"\\nHuck dropped his shovel.\\n\"That\\'s it.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"That\\'s the very trouble.\\nWe got to give this one up.\\nWe can\\'t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing\\'s too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so.\\nI feel as if something\\'s behind me all the time; \\xa0and I\\'m afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there\\'s others in front a-waiting for a chance.\\nI been creeping all over, ever since I got here.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ve been pretty much so, too, Huck.\\nThey most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.\"\\n\"Lordy.\"\\n\"Yes, they do.\\nI\\'ve always heard that.\"\\n\"Tom, I don\\'t like to fool around much where there\\'s dead people.\\nA body\\'s bound to get into trouble with \\'em, sure.\"\\n\"I don\\'t like to stir \\'em up, either.\\nS\\'pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something.\"\\n\"Don\\'t Tom!\\nIt\\'s awful.\"\\n\"Well, it just is.\\nHuck, I don\\'t feel comfortable a bit.\"\\n\"Say, Tom, let\\'s give this place up, and try somewheres else.\"\\n\"All right, I reckon we better.\"\\n\"What\\'ll it be?\"\\nTom considered awhile; and then said:  \"The ha\\'nted house.\\nThat\\'s it.\"\\n\"Blame it, I don\\'t like ha\\'nted houses, Tom.\\nWhy, they\\'re a dern sight worse\\'n dead people.\\nDead people might talk, maybe, but they don\\'t come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain\\'t noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does.\\nI couldn\\'t stand such a thing as that, Tom--nobody could.\"\\n\"Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don\\'t travel around only at night.\\nThey won\\'t hender us from digging there in the daytime.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s so.\\nBut you know mighty well people don\\'t go about that ha\\'nted house in the day nor the night.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s mostly because they don\\'t like to go where a man\\'s been murdered, anyway--but nothing\\'s ever been seen around that house except in the night--just some blue lights slipping by the windows--no regular ghosts.\"\\n\"Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there\\'s a ghost mighty close behind it.\\nIt stands to reason.\\nBecuz you know that they don\\'t anybody but ghosts use \\'em.\"\\n\"Yes, that\\'s so.\\nBut anyway they don\\'t come around in the daytime, so what\\'s the use of our being afeard?\"\\n\"Well, all right.\\nWe\\'ll tackle the ha\\'nted house if you say so--but I reckon it\\'s taking chances.\"\\nThey had started down the hill by this time.\\nThere in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the \"ha\\'nte.\"\\nhouse, utterly isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof caved in.\\nThe boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.\\nTom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was measurably so, also--but suddenly said:  \"Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?\"\\nTom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them--  \"My!\\nI never once thought of it, Huck.\"\\n\"Well, I didn\\'t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.\"\\n\"Blame it, a body can\\'t be too careful, Huck.\\nWe might \\'a\\' got into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.\"\\n\"_Might_!\\nBetter say we _would_!\\nThere\\'s some lucky days, maybe, but Friday ain\\'t.\"\\n\"Any fool knows that.\\nI don\\'t reckon _you_ was the first that found it out, Huck.\"\\n\"Well, I never said I was, did I?\\nAnd Friday ain\\'t all, neither.\\nI had a rotten bad dream last night--dreampt about rats.\"\\n\"No!\\nSure sign of trouble.\\nDid they fight?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s good, Huck.\\nWhen they don\\'t fight it\\'s only a sign that there\\'s trouble around, you know.\\nAll we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it.\\nWe\\'ll drop this thing for today, and play.\\nDo you know Robin Hood, Huck?\"\\n\"No.\\nWho\\'s Robin Hood?\"\\n\"Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England--and the best.\\nHe was a robber.\"\\n\"Cracky, I wisht I was.\\nWho did he rob?\"\\n\"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like.\\nBut he never bothered the poor.\\nHe loved \\'em.\\nHe always divided up with \\'em perfectly square.\"\\n\"Well, he must \\'a\\' been a brick.\"\\n\"I bet you he was, Huck.\\nOh, he was the noblest man that ever was.\\nThey ain\\'t any such men now, I can tell you.\\nHe could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.\"\\n\"What\\'s a _yew_ bow?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\\nIt\\'s some kind of a bow, of course.\\nAnd if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse.\\nBut we\\'ll play Robin Hood--it\\'s nobby fun.\\nI\\'ll learn you.\"\\n\"I\\'m agreed.\"\\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow\\'s prospects and possibilities there.\\nAs the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.\\nOn Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.\\nThey had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel.\\nThe thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in.\\nThen they crept to the door and took a trembling peep.\\nThey saw a weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs.\\nThey presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and wondering at it, too.\\nNext they wanted to look upstairs.\\nThis was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one result--they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent.\\nUp there were the same signs of decay.\\nIn one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud--there was nothing in it.\\nTheir courage was up now and well in hand.\\nThey were about to go down and begin work when--  \"Sh.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"What is it?\"\\nwhispered Huck, blanching with fright.\\n\"Sh!...\\nThere!...\\nHear it?\"\\n\"Yes!...\\nOh, my!\\nLet\\'s run.\"\\n\"Keep still!\\nDon\\'t you budge!\\nThey\\'re coming right toward the door.\"\\nThe boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.\\n\"They\\'ve stopped....\\nNo--coming....\\nHere they are.\\nDon\\'t whisper another word, Huck.\\nMy goodness, I wish I was out of this.\"\\nTwo men entered.\\nEach boy said to himself: \"There\\'s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that\\'s been about town once or twice lately--never saw t\\'other man before.\"\\n\"T\\'othe.\"\\nwas a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant in his face.\\nThe Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green goggles.\\nWhen they came in, \"t\\'othe.\"\\nwas talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued his remarks.\\nHis manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:  \"No.\"\\nsaid he, \"I\\'ve thought it all over, and I don\\'t like it.\\nIt\\'s dangerous.\"\\n\"Dangerous.\"\\ngrunted the \"deaf and dum.\"\\nSpaniard--to the vast surprise of the boys.\\n\"Milksop.\"\\nThis voice made the boys gasp and quake.\\nIt was Injun Joe\\'s!\\nThere was silence for some time.\\nThen Joe said:  \"What\\'s any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothing\\'s come of it.\"\\n\"That\\'s different.\\nAway up the river so, and not another house about.\\n\\'Twon\\'t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn\\'t succeed.\"\\n\"Well, what\\'s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody would suspicion us that saw us.\"\\n\"I know that.\\nBut there warn\\'t any other place as handy after that fool of a job.\\nI want to quit this shanty.\\nI wanted to yesterday, only it warn\\'t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view.\"\\n\"Those infernal boy.\"\\nquaked again under the inspiration of this remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day.\\nThey wished in their hearts they had waited a year.\\nThe two men got out some food and made a luncheon.\\nAfter a long and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:  \"Look here, lad--you go back up the river where you belong.\\nWait there till you hear from me.\\nI\\'ll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more, for a look.\\nWe\\'ll do that \\'dangerous\\' job after I\\'ve spied around a little and think things look well for it.\\nThen for Texas!\\nWe\\'ll leg it together.\"\\nThis was satisfactory.\\nBoth men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe said:  \"I\\'m dead for sleep!\\nIt\\'s your turn to watch.\"\\nHe curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore.\\nHis comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet.\\nPresently the watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.\\nThe boys drew a long, grateful breath.\\nTom whispered:  \"Now\\'s our chance--come.\"\\nHuck said:  \"I can\\'t--I\\'d die if they was to wake.\"\\nTom urged--Huck held back.\\nAt last Tom rose slowly and softly, and started alone.\\nBut the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright.\\nHe never made a second attempt.\\nThe boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray; and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.\\nNow one snore ceased.\\nInjun Joe sat up, stared around--smiled grimly upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees--stirred him up with his foot and said:  \"Here!\\n_You\\'re_ a watchman, ain\\'t you!\\nAll right, though--nothing\\'s happened.\"\\n\"My!\\nhave I been asleep?\"\\n\"Oh, partly, partly.\\nNearly time for us to be moving, pard.\\nWhat\\'ll we do with what little swag we\\'ve got left?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know--leave it here as we\\'ve always done, I reckon.\\nNo use to take it away till we start south.\\nSix hundred and fifty in silver\\'s something to carry.\"\\n\"Well--all right--it won\\'t matter to come here once more.\"\\n\"No--but I\\'d say come in the night as we used to do--it\\'s better.\"\\n\"Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right chance at that job; accidents might happen; \\'tain\\'t in such a very good place; we\\'ll just regularly bury it--and bury it deep.\"\\n\"Good idea.\"\\nsaid the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down, raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly.\\nHe subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.\\nThe boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant.\\nWith gloating eyes they watched every movement.\\nLuck!--the splendor of it was beyond all imagination!\\nSix hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich!\\nHere was treasure-hunting under the happiest auspices--there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig.\\nThey nudged each other every moment--eloquent nudges and easily understood, for they simply meant--\"Oh, but ain\\'t you glad _now_ we\\'re here.\"\\nJoe\\'s knife struck upon something.\\n\"Hello.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"What is it?\"\\nsaid his comrade.\\n\"Half-rotten plank--no, it\\'s a box, I believe.\\nHere--bear a hand and we\\'ll see what it\\'s here for.\\nNever mind, I\\'ve broke a hole.\"\\nHe reached his hand in and drew it out--  \"Man, it\\'s money.\"\\nThe two men examined the handful of coins.\\nThey were gold.\\nThe boys above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.\\nJoe\\'s comrade said:  \"We\\'ll make quick work of this.\\nThere\\'s an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--I saw it a minute ago.\"\\nHe ran and brought the boys\\' pick and shovel.\\nInjun Joe took the pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to himself, and then began to use it.\\nThe box was soon unearthed.\\nIt was not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it.\\nThe men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence.\\n\"Pard, there\\'s thousands of dollars here.\"\\nsaid Injun Joe.\\n\"\\'Twas always said that Murrel\\'s gang used to be around here one summer.\"\\nthe stranger observed.\\n\"I know it.\"\\nsaid Injun Joe; \"and this looks like it, I should say.\"\\n\"Now you won\\'t need to do that job.\"\\nThe halfbreed frowned.\\nSaid he:  \"You don\\'t know me.\\nLeast you don\\'t know all about that thing.\\n\\'Tain\\'t robbery altogether--it\\'s _revenge_.\"\\nand a wicked light flamed in his eyes.\\n\"I\\'ll need your help in it.\\nWhen it\\'s finished--then Texas.\\nGo home to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.\"\\n\"Well--if you say so; what\\'ll we do with this--bury it again?\"\\n\"Yes.\\n[Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_!\\nby the great Sachem, no!\\n[Profound distress overhead.] I\\'d nearly forgot.\\nThat pick had fresh earth on it!\\n[The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business has a pick and a shovel here?\\nWhat business with fresh earth on them?\\nWho brought them here--and where are they gone?\\nHave you heard anybody?--seen anybody?\\nWhat!\\nbury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed?\\nNot exactly--not exactly.\\nWe\\'ll take it to my den.\"\\n\"Why, of course!\\nMight have thought of that before.\\nYou mean Number One?\"\\n\"No--Number Two--under the cross.\\nThe other place is bad--too common.\"\\n\"All right.\\nIt\\'s nearly dark enough to start.\"\\nInjun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out.\\nPresently he said:  \"Who could have brought those tools here?\\nDo you reckon they can be upstairs?\"\\nThe boys\\' breath forsook them.\\nInjun Joe put his hand on his knife, halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway.\\nThe boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone.\\nThe steps came creaking up the stairs--the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads--they were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway.\\nHe gathered himself up cursing, and his comrade said:  \"Now what\\'s the use of all that?\\nIf it\\'s anybody, and they\\'re up there, let them _stay_ there--who cares?\\nIf they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects?\\nIt will be dark in fifteen minutes--and then let them follow us if they want to.\\nI\\'m willing.\\nIn my opinion, whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something.\\nI\\'ll bet they\\'re running yet.\"\\nJoe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.\\nShortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.\\nTom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house.\\nFollow?\\nNot they.\\nThey were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the townward track over the hill.\\nThey did not talk much.\\nThey were too much absorbed in hating themselves--hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there.\\nBut for that, Injun Joe never would have suspected.\\nHe would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his \"reveng.\"\\nwas satisfied, and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing.\\nBitter, bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there!\\nThey resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to \"Number Two.\"\\nwherever that might be.\\nThen a ghastly thought occurred to Tom.\\n\"Revenge?\\nWhat if he means _us_, Huck.\"\\n\"Oh, don\\'t.\"\\nsaid Huck, nearly fainting.\\nThey talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else--at least that he might at least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.\\nVery, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger!\\nCompany would be a palpable improvement, he thought.\\nFour times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune.\\nAs he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away--somewhat as if they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by.\\nThen it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream!\\nThere was one very strong argument in favor of this idea--namely, that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real.\\nHe had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to \"hundred.\"\\nand \"thousand.\"\\nwere mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such sums really existed in the world.\\nHe never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one\\'s possession.\\nIf his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.\\nBut the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream, after all.\\nThis uncertainty must be swept away.\\nHe would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find Huck.\\nHuck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy.\\nTom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject.\\nIf he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream.\\n\"Hello, Huck.\"\\n\"Hello, yourself.\"\\nSilence, for a minute.\\n\"Tom, if we\\'d \\'a\\' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we\\'d \\'a\\' got the money.\\nOh, ain\\'t it awful.\"\\n\"\\'Tain\\'t a dream, then, \\'tain\\'t a dream!\\nSomehow I most wish it was.\\nDog\\'d if I don\\'t, Huck.\"\\n\"What ain\\'t a dream?\"\\n\"Oh, that thing yesterday.\\nI been half thinking it was.\"\\n\"Dream!\\nIf them stairs hadn\\'t broke down you\\'d \\'a\\' seen how much dream it was!\\nI\\'ve had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through \\'em--rot him.\"\\n\"No, not rot him.\\n_Find_ him!\\nTrack the money.\"\\n\"Tom, we\\'ll never find him.\\nA feller don\\'t have only one chance for such a pile--and that one\\'s lost.\\nI\\'d feel mighty shaky if I was to see him, anyway.\"\\n\"Well, so\\'d I; but I\\'d like to see him, anyway--and track him out--to his Number Two.\"\\n\"Number Two--yes, that\\'s it.\\nI been thinking \\'bout that.\\nBut I can\\'t make nothing out of it.\\nWhat do you reckon it is?\"\\n\"I dono.\\nIt\\'s too deep.\\nSay, Huck--maybe it\\'s the number of a house.\"\\n\"Goody!...\\nNo, Tom, that ain\\'t it.\\nIf it is, it ain\\'t in this one-horse town.\\nThey ain\\'t no numbers here.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s so.\\nLemme think a minute.\\nHere--it\\'s the number of a room--in a tavern, you know.\"\\n\"Oh, that\\'s the trick!\\nThey ain\\'t only two taverns.\\nWe can find out quick.\"\\n\"You stay here, Huck, till I come.\"\\nTom was off at once.\\nHe did not care to have Huck\\'s company in public places.\\nHe was gone half an hour.\\nHe found that in the best tavern, No.\\n2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.\\nIn the less ostentatious house, No.\\n2 was a mystery.\\nThe tavern-keeper\\'s young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this state of things; had had some little curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was \"ha\\'nted\"; had noticed that there was a light in there the night before.\\n\"That\\'s what I\\'ve found out, Huck.\\nI reckon that\\'s the very No.\\n2 we\\'re after.\"\\n\"I reckon it is, Tom.\\nNow what you going to do?\"\\n\"Lemme think.\"\\nTom thought a long time.\\nThen he said:  \"I\\'ll tell you.\\nThe back door of that No.\\n2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store.\\nNow you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and I\\'ll nip all of auntie\\'s, and the first dark night we\\'ll go there and try \\'em.\\nAnd mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge.\\nIf you see him, you just follow him; and if he don\\'t go to that No.\\n2, that ain\\'t the place.\"\\n\"Lordy, I don\\'t want to foller him by myself.\"\\n\"Why, it\\'ll be night, sure.\\nHe mightn\\'t ever see you--and if he did, maybe he\\'d never think anything.\"\\n\"Well, if it\\'s pretty dark I reckon I\\'ll track him.\\nI dono--I dono.\\nI\\'ll try.\"\\n\"You bet I\\'ll follow him, if it\\'s dark, Huck.\\nWhy, he might \\'a\\' found out he couldn\\'t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.\"\\n\"It\\'s so, Tom, it\\'s so.\\nI\\'ll foller him; I will, by jingoes.\"\\n\"Now you\\'re _talking_!\\nDon\\'t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won\\'t.\"\\nThey hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door.\\nNobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door.\\nThe night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and \"maow.\"\\nwhereupon he would slip out and try the keys.\\nBut the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.\\nTuesday the boys had the same ill luck.\\nAlso Wednesday.\\nBut Thursday night promised better.\\nTom slipped out in good season with his aunt\\'s old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with.\\nHe hid the lantern in Huck\\'s sugar hogshead and the watch began.\\nAn hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out.\\nNo Spaniard had been seen.\\nNobody had entered or left the alley.\\nEverything was auspicious.\\nThe blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.\\nTom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.\\nHuck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley.\\nThen there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck\\'s spirits like a mountain.\\nHe began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet.\\nIt seemed hours since Tom had disappeared.\\nSurely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement.\\nIn his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath.\\nThere was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the way it was beating.\\nSuddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him: \"Run.\"\\nsaid he; \"run, for your life.\"\\nHe needn\\'t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered.\\nThe boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the village.\\nJust as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down.\\nAs soon as Tom got his breath he said:  \"Huck, it was awful!\\nI tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn\\'t hardly get my breath I was so scared.\\nThey wouldn\\'t turn in the lock, either.\\nWell, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the door!\\nIt warn\\'t locked!\\nI hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, _Great Caesar\\'s Ghost!.\"\\n\"What!--what\\'d you see, Tom?\"\\n\"Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe\\'s hand.\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Yes!\\nHe was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out.\"\\n\"Lordy, what did you do?\\nDid he wake up?\"\\n\"No, never budged.\\nDrunk, I reckon.\\nI just grabbed that towel and started.\"\\n\"I\\'d never \\'a\\' thought of the towel, I bet.\"\\n\"Well, I would.\\nMy aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.\"\\n\"Say, Tom, did you see that box?\"\\n\"Huck, I didn\\'t wait to look around.\\nI didn\\'t see the box, I didn\\'t see the cross.\\nI didn\\'t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.\\nDon\\'t you see, now, what\\'s the matter with that ha\\'nted room?\"\\n\"How?\"\\n\"Why, it\\'s ha\\'nted with whiskey!\\nMaybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have got a ha\\'nted room, hey, Huck?\"\\n\"Well, I reckon maybe that\\'s so.\\nWho\\'d \\'a\\' thought such a thing?\\nBut say, Tom, now\\'s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe\\'s drunk.\"\\n\"It is, that!\\nYou try it.\"\\nHuck shuddered.\\n\"Well, no--I reckon not.\"\\n\"And I reckon not, Huck.\\nOnly one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain\\'t enough.\\nIf there\\'d been three, he\\'d be drunk enough and I\\'d do it.\"\\nThere was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:  \"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe\\'s not in there.\\nIt\\'s too scary.\\nNow, if we watch every night, we\\'ll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we\\'ll snatch that box quicker\\'n lightning.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'m agreed.\\nI\\'ll watch the whole night long, and I\\'ll do it every night, too, if you\\'ll do the other part of the job.\"\\n\"All right, I will.\\nAll you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and maow--and if I\\'m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that\\'ll fetch me.\"\\n\"Agreed, and good as wheat.\"\\n\"Now, Huck, the storm\\'s over, and I\\'ll go home.\\nIt\\'ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours.\\nYou go back and watch that long, will you?\"\\n\"I said I would, Tom, and I will.\\nI\\'ll ha\\'nt that tavern every night for a year!\\nI\\'ll sleep all day and I\\'ll stand watch all night.\"\\n\"That\\'s all right.\\nNow, where you going to sleep?\"\\n\"In Ben Rogers\\' hayloft.\\nHe lets me, and so does his pap\\'s nigger man, Uncle Jake.\\nI tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.\\nThat\\'s a mighty good nigger, Tom.\\nHe likes me, becuz I don\\'t ever act as if I was above him.\\nSometime I\\'ve set right down and eat _with_ him.\\nBut you needn\\'t tell that.\\nA body\\'s got to do things when he\\'s awful hungry he wouldn\\'t want to do as a steady thing.\"\\n\"Well, if I don\\'t want you in the daytime, I\\'ll let you sleep.\\nI won\\'t come bothering around.\\nAny time you see something\\'s up, in the night, just skip right around and maow.\"\\nBoth Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy\\'s interest.\\nHe saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing \"hisp.\"\\nand \"gully-keepe.\"\\nwith a crowd of their schoolmates.\\nThe day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented.\\nThe child\\'s delight was boundless; and Tom\\'s not more moderate.\\nThe invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation.\\nTom\\'s excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck\\'s \"maow.\"\\nand of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers with, next day; but he was disappointed.\\nNo signal came that night.\\nMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o\\'clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher\\'s, and everything was ready for a start.\\nIt was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence.\\nThe children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts.\\nThe old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets.\\nSid was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him.\\nThe last thing Mrs.\\nThatcher said to Becky, was:  \"You\\'ll not get back till late.\\nPerhaps you\\'d better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.\"\\n\"Then I\\'ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.\"\\n\"Very well.\\nAnd mind and behave yourself and don\\'t be any trouble.\"\\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:  \"Say--I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do.\\n\\'Stead of going to Joe Harper\\'s we\\'ll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas\\'.\\nShe\\'ll have ice-cream!\\nShe has it most every day--dead loads of it.\\nAnd she\\'ll be awful glad to have us.\"\\n\"Oh, that will be fun.\"\\nThen Becky reflected a moment and said:  \"But what will mamma say?\"\\n\"How\\'ll she ever know?\"\\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:  \"I reckon it\\'s wrong--but-.\"\\n\"But shucks!\\nYour mother won\\'t know, and so what\\'s the harm?\\nAll she wants is that you\\'ll be safe; and I bet you she\\'d \\'a\\' said go there if she\\'d \\'a\\' thought of it.\\nI know she would.\"\\nThe Widow Douglas\\' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait.\\nIt and Tom\\'s persuasions presently carried the day.\\nSo it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night\\'s programme.\\nPresently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal.\\nThe thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations.\\nStill he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas\\'.\\nAnd why should he give it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight?\\nThe sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.\\nThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up.\\nThe crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter.\\nAll the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things began.\\nAfter the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks.\\nBy-and-by somebody shouted:  \"Who\\'s ready for the cave?\"\\nEverybody was.\\nBundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill.\\nThe mouth of the cave was up the hillside--an opening shaped like a letter A.\\nIts massive oaken door stood unbarred.\\nWithin was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat.\\nIt was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun.\\nBut the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again.\\nThe moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase.\\nBut all things have an end.\\nBy-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead.\\nThis main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide.\\nEvery few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal\\'s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere.\\nIt was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them.\\nNo man \"kne.\"\\nthe cave.\\nThat was an impossible thing.\\nMost of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.\\nTom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.\\nThe procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again.\\nParties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the \"know.\"\\nground.\\nBy-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of the day.\\nThen they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand.\\nThe clanging bell had been calling for half an hour.\\nHowever, this sort of close to the day\\'s adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory.\\nWhen the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft.\\nHuck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat\\'s lights went glinting past the wharf.\\nHe heard no noise on board, for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death.\\nHe wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop at the wharf--and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business.\\nThe night was growing cloudy and dark.\\nTen o\\'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts.\\nEleven o\\'clock came, and the tavern lights were put out; darkness everywhere, now.\\nHuck waited what seemed a weary long time, but nothing happened.\\nHis faith was weakening.\\nWas there any use?\\nWas there really any use?\\nWhy not give it up and turn in?\\nA noise fell upon his ear.\\nHe was all attention in an instant.\\nThe alley door closed softly.\\nHe sprang to the corner of the brick store.\\nThe next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under his arm.\\nIt must be that box!\\nSo they were going to remove the treasure.\\nWhy call Tom now?\\nIt would be absurd--the men would get away with the box and never be found again.\\nNo, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery.\\nSo communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.\\nThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a crossstreet.\\nThey went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took.\\nThey passed by the old Welshman\\'s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward.\\nGood, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.\\nBut they never stopped at the quarry.\\nThey passed on, up the summit.\\nThey plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom.\\nHuck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him.\\nHe trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart.\\nThe hooting of an owl came over the hill--ominous sound!\\nBut no footsteps.\\nHeavens, was everything lost!\\nHe was about to spring with winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him!\\nHuck\\'s heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground.\\nHe knew where he was.\\nHe knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas\\' grounds.\\nVery well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won\\'t be hard to find.\\nNow there was a voice--a very low voice--Injun Joe\\'s:  \"Damn her, maybe she\\'s got company--there\\'s lights, late as it is.\"\\n\"I can\\'t see any.\"\\nThis was that stranger\\'s voice--the stranger of the haunted house.\\nA deadly chill went to Huck\\'s heart--this, then, was the \"reveng.\"\\njob!\\nHis thought was, to fly.\\nThen he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder her.\\nHe wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn\\'t dare--they might come and catch him.\\nHe thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger\\'s remark and Injun Joe\\'s next--which was--  \"Because the bush is in your way.\\nNow--this way--now you see, don\\'t you?\"\\n\"Yes.\\nWell, there _is_ company there, I reckon.\\nBetter give it up.\"\\n\"Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever!\\nGive it up and maybe never have another chance.\\nI tell you again, as I\\'ve told you before, I don\\'t care for her swag--you may have it.\\nBut her husband was rough on me--many times he was rough on me--and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant.\\nAnd that ain\\'t all.\\nIt ain\\'t a millionth part of it!\\nHe had me _horsewhipped_!--horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a nigger!--with all the town looking on!\\n_Horsewhipped_!--do you understand?\\nHe took advantage of me and died.\\nBut I\\'ll take it out of _her_.\"\\n\"Oh, don\\'t kill her!\\nDon\\'t do that.\"\\n\"Kill?\\nWho said anything about killing?\\nI would kill _him_ if he was here; but not her.\\nWhen you want to get revenge on a woman you don\\'t kill her--bosh!\\nyou go for her looks.\\nYou slit her nostrils--you notch her ears like a sow.\"\\n\"By God, that\\'s-.\"\\n\"Keep your opinion to yourself!\\nIt will be safest for you.\\nI\\'ll tie her to the bed.\\nIf she bleeds to death, is that my fault?\\nI\\'ll not cry, if she does.\\nMy friend, you\\'ll help me in this thing--for _my_ sake--that\\'s why you\\'re here--I mightn\\'t be able alone.\\nIf you flinch, I\\'ll kill you.\\nDo you understand that?\\nAnd if I have to kill you, I\\'ll kill her--and then I reckon nobody\\'ll ever know much about who done this business.\"\\n\"Well, if it\\'s got to be done, let\\'s get at it.\\nThe quicker the better--I\\'m all in a shiver.\"\\n\"Do it _now_?\\nAnd company there?\\nLook here--I\\'ll get suspicious of you, first thing you know.\\nNo--we\\'ll wait till the lights are out--there\\'s no hurry.\"\\nHuck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the other.\\nHe took another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig snapped under his foot!\\nHis breath stopped and he listened.\\nThere was no sound--the stillness was perfect.\\nHis gratitude was measureless.\\nNow he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship--and then stepped quickly but cautiously along.\\nWhen he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew.\\nDown, down he sped, till he reached the Welshman\\'s.\\nHe banged at the door, and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.\\n\"What\\'s the row there?\\nWho\\'s banging?\\nWhat do you want?\"\\n\"Let me in--quick!\\nI\\'ll tell everything.\"\\n\"Why, who are you?\"\\n\"Huckleberry Finn--quick, let me in.\"\\n\"Huckleberry Finn, indeed!\\nIt ain\\'t a name to open many doors, I judge!\\nBut let him in, lads, and let\\'s see what\\'s the trouble.\"\\n\"Please don\\'t ever tell I told you.\"\\nwere Huck\\'s first words when he got in.\\n\"Please don\\'t--I\\'d be killed, sure--but the widow\\'s been good friends to me sometimes, and I want to tell--I _will_ tell if you\\'ll promise you won\\'t ever say it was me.\"\\n\"By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn\\'t act so.\"\\nexclaimed the old man; \"out with it and nobody here\\'ll ever tell, lad.\"\\nThree minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in their hands.\\nHuck accompanied them no further.\\nHe hid behind a great bowlder and fell to listening.\\nThere was a lagging, anxious silence, and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.\\nHuck waited for no particulars.\\nHe sprang away and sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him.\\nThe inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night.\\nA call came from a window:  \"Who\\'s there.\"\\nHuck\\'s scared voice answered in a low tone:  \"Please let me in!\\nIt\\'s only Huck Finn.\"\\n\"It\\'s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!--and welcome.\"\\nThese were strange words to the vagabond boy\\'s ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard.\\nHe could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before.\\nThe door was quickly unlocked, and he entered.\\nHuck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.\\n\"Now, my boy, I hope you\\'re good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun\\'s up, and we\\'ll have a piping hot one, too--make yourself easy about that!\\nI and the boys hoped you\\'d turn up and stop here last night.\"\\n\"I was awful scared.\"\\nsaid Huck, \"and I run.\\nI took out when the pistols went off, and I didn\\'t stop for three mile.\\nI\\'ve come now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn\\'t want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.\"\\n\"Well, poor chap, you do look as if you\\'d had a hard night of it--but there\\'s a bed here for you when you\\'ve had your breakfast.\\nNo, they ain\\'t dead, lad--we are sorry enough for that.\\nYou see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them--dark as a cellar that sumach path was--and just then I found I was going to sneeze.\\nIt was the meanest kind of luck!\\nI tried to keep it back, but no use--\\'twas bound to come, and it did come!\\nI was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out, \\'Fire boys!\\' and blazed away at the place where the rustling was.\\nSo did the boys.\\nBut they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods.\\nI judge we never touched them.\\nThey fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn\\'t do us any harm.\\nAs soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables.\\nThey got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods.\\nMy boys will be with them presently.\\nI wish we had some sort of description of those rascals--\\'twould help a good deal.\\nBut you couldn\\'t see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?\"\\n\"Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.\"\\n\"Splendid!\\nDescribe them--describe them, my boy.\"\\n\"One\\'s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that\\'s ben around here once or twice, and t\\'other\\'s a mean-looking, ragged-.\"\\n\"That\\'s enough, lad, we know the men!\\nHappened on them in the woods back of the widow\\'s one day, and they slunk away.\\nOff with you, boys, and tell the sheriff--get your breakfast tomorrow morning.\"\\nThe Welshman\\'s sons departed at once.\\nAs they were leaving the room Huck sprang up and exclaimed:  \"Oh, please don\\'t tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them!\\nOh, please.\"\\n\"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you did.\"\\n\"Oh no, no!\\nPlease don\\'t tell.\"\\nWhen the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:  \"They won\\'t tell--and I won\\'t.\\nBut why don\\'t you want it known?\"\\nHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world--he would be killed for knowing it, sure.\\nThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:  \"How did you come to follow these fellows, lad?\\nWere they looking suspicious?\"\\nHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply.\\nThen he said:  \"Well, you see, I\\'m a kind of a hard lot,--least everybody says so, and I don\\'t see nothing agin it--and sometimes I can\\'t sleep much, on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing.\\nThat was the way of it last night.\\nI couldn\\'t sleep, and so I come along upstreet \\'bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think.\\nWell, just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their arm, and I reckoned they\\'d stole it.\\nOne was a-smoking, and t\\'other one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t\\'other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil.\"\\n\"Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?\"\\nThis staggered Huck for a moment.\\nThen he said:  \"Well, I don\\'t know--but somehow it seems as if I did.\"\\n\"Then they went on, and you-.\"\\n\"Follered \\'em--yes.\\nThat was it.\\nI wanted to see what was up--they sneaked along so.\\nI dogged \\'em to the widder\\'s stile, and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he\\'d spile her looks just as I told you and your two-.\"\\n\"What!\\nThe _deaf and dumb_ man said all that.\"\\nHuck had made another terrible mistake!\\nHe was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do.\\nHe made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man\\'s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.\\nPresently the Welshman said:  \"My boy, don\\'t be afraid of me.\\nI wouldn\\'t hurt a hair of your head for all the world.\\nNo--I\\'d protect you--I\\'d protect you.\\nThis Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you\\'ve let that slip without intending it; you can\\'t cover that up now.\\nYou know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark.\\nNow trust me--tell me what it is, and trust me--I won\\'t betray you.\"\\nHuck looked into the old man\\'s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and whispered in his ear:  \"\\'Tain\\'t a Spaniard--it\\'s Injun Joe.\"\\nThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair.\\nIn a moment he said:  \"It\\'s all plain enough, now.\\nWhen you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don\\'t take that sort of revenge.\\nBut an Injun!\\nThat\\'s a different matter altogether.\"\\nDuring breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood.\\nThey found none, but captured a bulky bundle of--  \"Of _what_?\"\\nIf the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from Huck\\'s blanched lips.\\nHis eyes were staring wide, now, and his breath suspended--waiting for the answer.\\nThe Welshman started--stared in return--three seconds--five seconds--ten--then replied:  \"Of burglar\\'s tools.\\nWhy, what\\'s the _matter_ with you?\"\\nHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful.\\nThe Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously--and presently said:  \"Yes, burglar\\'s tools.\\nThat appears to relieve you a good deal.\\nBut what did give you that turn?\\nWhat were _you_ expecting we\\'d found?\"\\nHuck was in a close place--the inquiring eye was upon him--he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer--nothing suggested itself--the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper--a senseless reply offered--there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it--feebly:  \"Sunday-school books, maybe.\"\\nPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man\\'s pocket, because it cut down the doctor\\'s bill like everything.\\nThen he added:  \"Poor old chap, you\\'re white and jaded--you ain\\'t well a bit--no wonder you\\'re a little flighty and off your balance.\\nBut you\\'ll come out of it.\\nRest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.\"\\nHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow\\'s stile.\\nHe had only thought it was not the treasure, however--he had not known that it wasn\\'t--and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession.\\nBut on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable.\\nIn fact, everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No.\\n2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption.\\nJust as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door.\\nHuck jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late event.\\nThe Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill--to stare at the stile.\\nSo the news had spread.\\nThe Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors.\\nThe widow\\'s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\\n\"Don\\'t say a word about it, madam.\\nThere\\'s another that you\\'re more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don\\'t allow me to tell his name.\\nWe wouldn\\'t have been there but for him.\"\\nOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his secret.\\nWhen all else had been learned, the widow said:  \"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise.\\nWhy didn\\'t you come and wake me?\"\\n\"We judged it warn\\'t worth while.\\nThose fellows warn\\'t likely to come again--they hadn\\'t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death?\\nMy three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night.\\nThey\\'ve just come back.\"\\nMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more.\\nThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was early at church.\\nThe stirring event was well canvassed.\\nNews came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered.\\nWhen the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher\\'s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.\\nHarper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:  \"Is my Becky going to sleep all day?\\nI just expected she would be tired to death.\"\\n\"Your Becky?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nwith a startled look--\"didn\\'t she stay with you last night?\"\\n\"Why, no.\"\\nMrs.\\nThatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by.\\nAunt Polly said:  \"Goodmorning, Mrs.\\nThatcher.\\nGoodmorning, Mrs.\\nHarper.\\nI\\'ve got a boy that\\'s turned up missing.\\nI reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night--one of you.\\nAnd now he\\'s afraid to come to church.\\nI\\'ve got to settle with him.\"\\nMrs.\\nThatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.\\n\"He didn\\'t stay with us.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nHarper, beginning to look uneasy.\\nA marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly\\'s face.\\n\"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?\"\\n\"No\\'m.\"\\n\"When did you see him last?\"\\nJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say.\\nThe people had stopped moving out of church.\\nWhispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance.\\nChildren were anxiously questioned, and young teachers.\\nThey all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing.\\nOne young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!\\nMrs.\\nThatcher swooned away.\\nAunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.\\nThe alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up!\\nThe Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave.\\nAll the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead.\\nMany women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs.\\nThatcher and tried to comfort them.\\nThey cried with them, too, and that was still better than words.\\nAll the tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, \"Send more candles--and send food.\"\\nMrs.\\nThatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also.\\nJudge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.\\nThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out.\\nHe found Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with fever.\\nThe physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient.\\nShe said she would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord\\'s, and nothing that was the Lord\\'s was a thing to be neglected.\\nThe Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:  \"You can depend on it.\\nThat\\'s the Lord\\'s mark.\\nHe don\\'t leave it off.\\nHe never does.\\nPuts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands.\"\\nEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching.\\nAll the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles.\\nIn one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names \"BECKY & TO.\"\\nhad been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon.\\nMrs.\\nThatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it.\\nShe said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came.\\nSome said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher\\'s light.\\nThree dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and the village sank into a hopeless stupor.\\nNo one had heart for anything.\\nThe accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the fact was.\\nIn a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked--dimly dreading the worst--if anything had been discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsaid the widow.\\nHuck started up in bed, wildeyed:  \"What?\\nWhat was it?\"\\n\"Liquor!--and the place has been shut up.\\nLie down, child--what a turn you did give me.\"\\n\"Only tell me just one thing--only just one--please!\\nWas it Tom Sawyer that found it?\"\\nThe widow burst into tears.\\n\"Hush, hush, child, hush!\\nI\\'ve told you before, you must _not_ talk.\\nYou are very, very sick.\"\\nThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold.\\nSo the treasure was gone forever--gone forever!\\nBut what could she be crying about?\\nCurious that she should cry.\\nThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck\\'s mind, and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep.\\nThe widow said to herself:  \"There--he\\'s asleep, poor wreck.\\nTom Sawyer find it!\\nPity but somebody could find Tom Sawyer!\\nAh, there ain\\'t many left, now, that\\'s got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.\"\\nThey tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names, such as \"The Drawing-Room.\"\\n\"The Cathedral.\"\\n\"Aladdin\\'s Palace.\"\\nand so on.\\nPresently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke).\\nStill drifting along and talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed.\\nThey smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on.\\nPresently they came to a place where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone.\\nTom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky\\'s gratification.\\nHe found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.\\nBecky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future guidance, and started upon their quest.\\nThey wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about.\\nIn one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man\\'s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it.\\nThis shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries.\\nUnder the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles.\\nTom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct.\\nHe seized Becky\\'s hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky\\'s light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern.\\nThe bats chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous things.\\nTom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows.\\nHe wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile, first.\\nNow, for the first time, the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children.\\nBecky said:  \"Why, I didn\\'t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others.\"\\n\"Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them--and I don\\'t know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is.\\nWe couldn\\'t hear them here.\"\\nBecky grew apprehensive.\\n\"I wonder how long we\\'ve been down here, Tom?\\nWe better start back.\"\\n\"Yes, I reckon we better.\\nP\\'raps we better.\"\\n\"Can you find the way, Tom?\\nIt\\'s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.\"\\n\"I reckon I could find it--but then the bats.\\nIf they put our candles out it will be an awful fix.\\nLet\\'s try some other way, so as not to go through there.\"\\n\"Well.\\nBut I hope we won\\'t get lost.\\nIt would be so awful.\"\\nand the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.\\nThey started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it; but they were all strange.\\nEvery time Tom made an examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:  \"Oh, it\\'s all right.\\nThis ain\\'t the one, but we\\'ll come to it right away.\"\\nBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted.\\nHe still said it was \"all right.\"\\nbut there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said, \"All is lost.\"\\nBecky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come.\\nAt last she said:  \"Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let\\'s go back that way!\\nWe seem to get worse and worse off all the time.\"\\n\"Listen.\"\\nsaid he.\\nProfound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush.\\nTom shouted.\\nThe call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.\\n\"Oh, don\\'t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid.\"\\nsaid Becky.\\n\"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know.\"\\nand he shouted again.\\nThe \"migh.\"\\nwas even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope.\\nThe children stood still and listened; but there was no result.\\nTom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps.\\nIt was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky--he could not find his way back!\\n\"Oh, Tom, you didn\\'t make any marks.\"\\n\"Becky, I was such a fool!\\nSuch a fool!\\nI never thought we might want to come back!\\nNo--I can\\'t find the way.\\nIt\\'s all mixed up.\"\\n\"Tom, Tom, we\\'re lost!\\nwe\\'re lost!\\nWe never can get out of this awful place!\\nOh, why _did_ we ever leave the others.\"\\nShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason.\\nHe sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter.\\nTom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not.\\nHe fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better effect.\\nShe said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more.\\nFor he was no more to blame than she, she said.\\nSo they moved on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they could do was to move, keep moving.\\nFor a little while, hope made a show of reviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure.\\nBy-and-by Tom took Becky\\'s candle and blew it out.\\nThis economy meant so much!\\nWords were not needed.\\nBecky understood, and her hope died again.\\nShe knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets--yet he must economize.\\nBy-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.\\nAt last Becky\\'s frail limbs refused to carry her farther.\\nShe sat down.\\nTom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light!\\nBecky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms.\\nFatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep.\\nTom was grateful.\\nHe sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there.\\nThe peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories.\\nWhile he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh--but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.\\n\"Oh, how _could_ I sleep!\\nI wish I never, never had waked!\\nNo!\\nNo, I don\\'t, Tom!\\nDon\\'t look so!\\nI won\\'t say it again.\"\\n\"I\\'m glad you\\'ve slept, Becky; you\\'ll feel rested, now, and we\\'ll find the way out.\"\\n\"We can try, Tom; but I\\'ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream.\\nI reckon we are going there.\"\\n\"Maybe not, maybe not.\\nCheer up, Becky, and let\\'s go on trying.\"\\nThey rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless.\\nThey tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not be, for their candles were not gone yet.\\nA long time after this--they could not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water--they must find a spring.\\nThey found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest again.\\nBoth were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther.\\nShe was surprised to hear Tom dissent.\\nShe could not understand it.\\nThey sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay.\\nThought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time.\\nThen Becky broke the silence:  \"Tom, I am so hungry.\"\\nTom took something out of his pocket.\\n\"Do you remember this?\"\\nsaid he.\\nBecky almost smiled.\\n\"It\\'s our wedding-cake, Tom.\"\\n\"Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it\\'s all we\\'ve got.\"\\n\"I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup people do with wedding-cake--but it\\'ll be our-.\"\\nShe dropped the sentence where it was.\\nTom divided the cake and Becky ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety.\\nThere was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with.\\nBy-and-by Becky suggested that they move on again.\\nTom was silent a moment.\\nThen he said:  \"Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?\"\\nBecky\\'s face paled, but she thought she could.\\n\"Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there\\'s water to drink.\\nThat little piece is our last candle.\"\\nBecky gave loose to tears and wailings.\\nTom did what he could to comfort her, but with little effect.\\nAt length Becky said:  \"Tom.\"\\n\"Well, Becky?\"\\n\"They\\'ll miss us and hunt for us.\"\\n\"Yes, they will!\\nCertainly they will.\"\\n\"Maybe they\\'re hunting for us now, Tom.\"\\n\"Why, I reckon maybe they are.\\nI hope they are.\"\\n\"When would they miss us, Tom?\"\\n\"When they get back to the boat, I reckon.\"\\n\"Tom, it might be dark then--would they notice we hadn\\'t come?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\\nBut anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they got home.\"\\nA frightened look in Becky\\'s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder.\\nBecky was not to have gone home that night!\\nThe children became silent and thoughtful.\\nIn a moment a new burst of grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also--that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs.\\nThatcher discovered that Becky was not at Mrs.\\nHarper\\'s.\\nThe children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then--the horror of utter darkness reigned!\\nHow long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in Tom\\'s arms, neither could tell.\\nAll that they knew was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more.\\nTom said it might be Sunday, now--maybe Monday.\\nHe tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone.\\nTom said that they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going on.\\nHe would shout and maybe some one would come.\\nHe tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more.\\nThe hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again.\\nA portion of Tom\\'s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it.\\nBut they seemed hungrier than before.\\nThe poor morsel of food only whetted desire.\\nBy-and-by Tom said:  \"SH!\\nDid you hear that?\"\\nBoth held their breath and listened.\\nThere was a sound like the faintest, far-off shout.\\nInstantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction.\\nPresently he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little nearer.\\n\"It\\'s them.\"\\nsaid Tom; \"they\\'re coming!\\nCome along, Becky--we\\'re all right now.\"\\nThe joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming.\\nTheir speed was slow, however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded against.\\nThey shortly came to one and had to stop.\\nIt might be three feet deep, it might be a hundred--there was no passing it at any rate.\\nTom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could.\\nNo bottom.\\nThey must stay there and wait until the searchers came.\\nThey listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!\\na moment or two more and they had gone altogether.\\nThe heart-sinking misery of it!\\nTom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use.\\nHe talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.\\nThe children groped their way back to the spring.\\nThe weary time dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken.\\nTom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.\\nNow an idea struck him.\\nThere were some side passages near at hand.\\nIt would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness.\\nHe took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along.\\nAt the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a \"jumping-off place.\"\\nTom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock!\\nTom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to--Injun Joe\\'s!\\nTom was paralyzed; he could not move.\\nHe was vastly gratified the next moment, to see the \"Spaniar.\"\\ntake to his heels and get himself out of sight.\\nTom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court.\\nBut the echoes must have disguised the voice.\\nWithout doubt, that was it, he reasoned.\\nTom\\'s fright weakened every muscle in his body.\\nHe said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again.\\nHe was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen.\\nHe told her he had only shouted \"for luck.\"\\nBut hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.\\nAnother tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes.\\nThe children awoke tortured with a raging hunger.\\nTom believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given over.\\nHe proposed to explore another passage.\\nHe felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors.\\nBut Becky was very weak.\\nShe had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused.\\nShe said she would wait, now, where she was, and die--it would not be long.\\nShe told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.\\nTom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave; then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom.\\nThe village of St.\\nPetersburg still mourned.\\nThe lost children had not been found.\\nPublic prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner\\'s whole heart in it; but still no good news came from the cave.\\nThe majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the children could never be found.\\nMrs.\\nThatcher was very ill, and a great part of the time delirious.\\nPeople said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan.\\nAunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white.\\nThe village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.\\nAway in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people, who shouted, \"Turn out!\\nturn out!\\nthey\\'re found!\\nthey\\'re found.\"\\nTin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah!\\nThe village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen.\\nDuring the first half-hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher\\'s house, seized the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs.\\nThatcher\\'s hand, tried to speak but couldn\\'t--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.\\nAunt Polly\\'s happiness was complete, and Mrs.\\nThatcher\\'s nearly so.\\nIt would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband.\\nTom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it, pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by!\\nAnd if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more!\\nHe told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to.\\nHe described how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men didn\\'t believe the wild tale at first, \"because.\"\\nsaid they, \"you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in\"--then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.\\nBefore day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind them, and informed of the great news.\\nThree days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered.\\nThey were bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn, all the time.\\nTom got about, a little, on Thursday, was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.\\nTom learned of Huck\\'s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.\\nHe was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic.\\nThe Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed.\\nAt home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the \"ragged man\\'.\"\\nbody had eventually been found in the river near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.\\nAbout a fortnight after Tom\\'s rescue from the cave, he started off to visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought.\\nJudge Thatcher\\'s house was on Tom\\'s way, and he stopped to see Becky.\\nThe Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him ironically if he wouldn\\'t like to go to the cave again.\\nTom said he thought he wouldn\\'t mind it.\\nThe Judge said:  \"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I\\'ve not the least doubt.\\nBut we have taken care of that.\\nNobody will get lost in that cave any more.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and triple-locked--and I\\'ve got the keys.\"\\nTom turned as white as a sheet.\\n\"What\\'s the matter, boy!\\nHere, run, somebody!\\nFetch a glass of water.\"\\nThe water was brought and thrown into Tom\\'s face.\\n\"Ah, now you\\'re all right.\\nWhat was the matter with you, Tom?\"\\n\"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe\\'s in the cave.\"\\nTom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.\\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place.\\nInjun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside.\\nTom was touched, for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered.\\nHis pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\\nInjun Joe\\'s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two.\\nThe great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself.\\nBut if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it.\\nSo he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something--in order to pass the weary time--in order to employ his tortured faculties.\\nOrdinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now.\\nThe prisoner had searched them out and eaten them.\\nHe had also contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws.\\nThe poor unfortunate had starved to death.\\nIn one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead.\\nThe captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick--a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours.\\nThat drop was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was \"news.\"\\nIt is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion.\\nHas everything a purpose and a mission?\\nDid this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect\\'s need?\\nand has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come?\\nNo matter.\\nIt is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal\\'s cave.\\nInjun Joe\\'s cup stands first in the list of the cavern\\'s marvels; even \"Aladdin\\'s Palac.\"\\ncannot rival it.\\nInjun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the hanging.\\nThis funeral stopped the further growth of one thing--the petition to the governor for Injun Joe\\'s pardon.\\nThe petition had been largely signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot.\\nInjun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the village, but what of that?\\nIf he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water-works.\\nThe morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an important talk.\\nHuck had learned all about Tom\\'s adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted to talk about now.\\nHuck\\'s face saddened.\\nHe said:  \"I know what it is.\\nYou got into No.\\n2 and never found anything but whiskey.\\nNobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must \\'a\\' ben you, soon as I heard \\'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn\\'t got the money becuz you\\'d \\'a\\' got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else.\\nTom, something\\'s always told me we\\'d never get holt of that swag.\"\\n\"Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper.\\n_You_ know his tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic.\\nDon\\'t you remember you was to watch there that night?\"\\n\"Oh yes!\\nWhy, it seems \\'bout a year ago.\\nIt was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder\\'s.\"\\n\"_You_ followed him?\"\\n\"Yes--but you keep mum.\\nI reckon Injun Joe\\'s left friends behind him, and I don\\'t want \\'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks.\\nIf it hadn\\'t ben for me he\\'d be down in Texas now, all right.\"\\nThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only heard of the Welshman\\'s part of it before.\\n\"Well.\"\\nsaid Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, \"whoever nipped the whiskey in No.\\n2, nipped the money, too, I reckon--anyways it\\'s a goner for us, Tom.\"\\n\"Huck, that money wasn\\'t ever in No.\\n2.\"\\n\"What.\"\\nHuck searched his comrade\\'s face keenly.\\n\"Tom, have you got on the track of that money again?\"\\n\"Huck, it\\'s in the cave.\"\\nHuck\\'s eyes blazed.\\n\"Say it again, Tom.\"\\n\"The money\\'s in the cave.\"\\n\"Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?\"\\n\"Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life.\\nWill you go in there with me and help get it out?\"\\n\"I bet I will!\\nI will if it\\'s where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost.\"\\n\"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world.\"\\n\"Good as wheat!\\nWhat makes you think the money\\'s-.\"\\n\"Huck, you just wait till we get in there.\\nIf we don\\'t find it I\\'ll agree to give you my drum and every thing I\\'ve got in the world.\\nI will, by jings.\"\\n\"All right--it\\'s a whiz.\\nWhen do you say?\"\\n\"Right now, if you say it.\\nAre you strong enough?\"\\n\"Is it far in the cave?\\nI ben on my pins a little, three or four days, now, but I can\\'t walk more\\'n a mile, Tom--least I don\\'t think I could.\"\\n\"It\\'s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck, but there\\'s a mighty short cut that they don\\'t anybody but me know about.\\nHuck, I\\'ll take you right to it in a skiff.\\nI\\'ll float the skiff down there, and I\\'ll pull it back again all by myself.\\nYou needn\\'t ever turn your hand over.\"\\n\"Less start right off, Tom.\"\\n\"All right.\\nWe want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled things they call lucifer matches.\\nI tell you, many\\'s the time I wished I had some when I was in there before.\"\\nA trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent, and got under way at once.\\nWhen they were several miles below \"Cave Hollow.\"\\nTom said:  \"Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike.\\nBut do you see that white place up yonder where there\\'s been a landslide?\\nWell, that\\'s one of my marks.\\nWe\\'ll get ashore, now.\"\\nThey landed.\\n\"Now, Huck, where we\\'re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out of with a fishing-pole.\\nSee if you can find it.\"\\nHuck searched all the place about, and found nothing.\\nTom proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:  \"Here you are!\\nLook at it, Huck; it\\'s the snuggest hole in this country.\\nYou just keep mum about it.\\nAll along I\\'ve been wanting to be a robber, but I knew I\\'d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across it was the bother.\\nWe\\'ve got it now, and we\\'ll keep it quiet, only we\\'ll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in--because of course there\\'s got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn\\'t be any style about it.\\nTom Sawyer\\'s Gang--it sounds splendid, don\\'t it, Huck?\"\\n\"Well, it just does, Tom.\\nAnd who\\'ll we rob?\"\\n\"Oh, most anybody.\\nWaylay people--that\\'s mostly the way.\"\\n\"And kill them?\"\\n\"No, not always.\\nHive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.\"\\n\"What\\'s a ransom?\"\\n\"Money.\\nYou make them raise all they can, off\\'n their friends; and after you\\'ve kept them a year, if it ain\\'t raised then you kill them.\\nThat\\'s the general way.\\nOnly you don\\'t kill the women.\\nYou shut up the women, but you don\\'t kill them.\\nThey\\'re always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared.\\nYou take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite.\\nThey ain\\'t anybody as polite as robbers--you\\'ll see that in any book.\\nWell, the women get to loving you, and after they\\'ve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn\\'t get them to leave.\\nIf you drove them out they\\'d turn right around and come back.\\nIt\\'s so in all the books.\"\\n\"Why, it\\'s real bully, Tom.\\nI believe it\\'s better\\'n to be a pirate.\"\\n\"Yes, it\\'s better in some ways, because it\\'s close to home and circuses and all that.\"\\nBy this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in the lead.\\nThey toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on.\\nA few steps brought them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.\\nHe showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire.\\nThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits.\\nThey went on, and presently entered and followed Tom\\'s other corridor until they reached the \"jumping-off place.\"\\nThe candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high.\\nTom whispered:  \"Now I\\'ll show you something, Huck.\"\\nHe held his candle aloft and said:  \"Look as far around the corner as you can.\\nDo you see that?\\nThere--on the big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.\"\\n\"Tom, it\\'s a _cross_.\"\\n\"_Now_ where\\'s your Number Two?\\n\\'_under the cross_,\\' hey?\\nRight yonder\\'s where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck.\"\\nHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:  \"Tom, less git out of here.\"\\n\"What!\\nand leave the treasure?\"\\n\"Yes--leave it.\\nInjun Joe\\'s ghost is round about there, certain.\"\\n\"No it ain\\'t, Huck, no it ain\\'t.\\nIt would ha\\'nt the place where he died--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.\"\\n\"No, Tom, it wouldn\\'t.\\nIt would hang round the money.\\nI know the ways of ghosts, and so do you.\"\\nTom began to fear that Huck was right.\\nMis-givings gathered in his mind.\\nBut presently an idea occurred to him--  \"Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we\\'re making of ourselves!\\nInjun Joe\\'s ghost ain\\'t a going to come around where there\\'s a cross.\"\\nThe point was well taken.\\nIt had its effect.\\n\"Tom, I didn\\'t think of that.\\nBut that\\'s so.\\nIt\\'s luck for us, that cross is.\\nI reckon we\\'ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.\"\\nTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.\\nHuck followed.\\nFour avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in.\\nThe boys examined three of them with no result.\\nThey found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls.\\nBut there was no moneybox.\\nThe lads searched and researched this place, but in vain.\\nTom said:  \"He said _under_ the cross.\\nWell, this comes nearest to being under the cross.\\nIt can\\'t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground.\"\\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged.\\nHuck could suggest nothing.\\nBy-and-by Tom said:  \"Lookyhere, Huck, there\\'s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides.\\nNow, what\\'s that for?\\nI bet you the money _is_ under the rock.\\nI\\'m going to dig in the clay.\"\\n\"That ain\\'t no bad notion, Tom.\"\\nsaid Huck with animation.\\nTom\\'s \"real Barlo.\"\\nwas out at once, and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood.\\n\"Hey, Huck!--you hear that?\"\\nHuck began to dig and scratch now.\\nSome boards were soon uncovered and removed.\\nThey had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.\\nTom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift.\\nHe proposed to explore.\\nHe stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended gradually.\\nHe followed its winding course, first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels.\\nTom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and exclaimed:  \"My goodness, Huck, lookyhere.\"\\nIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.\\n\"Got it at last.\"\\nsaid Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with his hand.\\n\"My, but we\\'re rich, Tom.\"\\n\"Huck, I always reckoned we\\'d get it.\\nIt\\'s just too good to believe, but we _have_ got it, sure!\\nSay--let\\'s not fool around here.\\nLet\\'s snake it out.\\nLemme see if I can lift the box.\"\\nIt weighed about fifty pounds.\\nTom could lift it, after an awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.\\n\"I thought so.\"\\nhe said; \"_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day at the ha\\'nted house.\\nI noticed that.\\nI reckon I was right to think of fetching the little bags along.\"\\nThe money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock.\\n\"Now less fetch the guns and things.\"\\nsaid Huck.\\n\"No, Huck--leave them there.\\nThey\\'re just the tricks to have when we go to robbing.\\nWe\\'ll keep them there all the time, and we\\'ll hold our orgies there, too.\\nIt\\'s an awful snug place for orgies.\"\\n\"What orgies?\"\\n\"I dono.\\nBut robbers always have orgies, and of course we\\'ve got to have them, too.\\nCome along, Huck, we\\'ve been in here a long time.\\nIt\\'s getting late, I reckon.\\nI\\'m hungry, too.\\nWe\\'ll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff.\"\\nThey presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff.\\nAs the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way.\\nTom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.\\n\"Now, Huck.\"\\nsaid Tom, \"we\\'ll hide the money in the loft of the widow\\'s woodshed, and I\\'ll come up in the morning and we\\'ll count it and divide, and then we\\'ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe.\\nJust you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor\\'s little wagon; I won\\'t be gone a minute.\"\\nHe disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging his cargo behind him.\\nWhen the boys reached the Welshman\\'s house, they stopped to rest.\\nJust as they were about to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:  \"Hallo, who\\'s that?\"\\n\"Huck and Tom Sawyer.\"\\n\"Good!\\nCome along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.\\nHere--hurry up, trot ahead--I\\'ll haul the wagon for you.\\nWhy, it\\'s not as light as it might be.\\nGot bricks in it?--or old metal?\"\\n\"Old metal.\"\\nsaid Tom.\\n\"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits\\' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work.\\nBut that\\'s human nature--hurry along, hurry along.\"\\nThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.\\n\"Never mind; you\\'ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas\\'.\"\\nHuck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being falsely accused:  \"Mr.\\nJones, we haven\\'t been doing nothing.\"\\nThe Welshman laughed.\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know, Huck, my boy.\\nI don\\'t know about that.\\nAin\\'t you and the widow good friends?\"\\n\"Yes.\\nWell, she\\'s ben good friends to me, anyway.\"\\n\"All right, then.\\nWhat do you want to be afraid for?\"\\nThis question was not entirely answered in Huck\\'s slow mind before he found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs.\\nDouglas\\' drawing-room.\\nMr.\\nJones left the wagon near the door and followed.\\nThe place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence in the village was there.\\nThe Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great many more, and all dressed in their best.\\nThe widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings.\\nThey were covered with clay and candle-grease.\\nAunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom.\\nNobody suffered half as much as the two boys did, however.\\nMr.\\nJones said:  \"Tom wasn\\'t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.\"\\n\"And you did just right.\"\\nsaid the widow.\\n\"Come with me, boys.\"\\nShe took them to a bedchamber and said:  \"Now wash and dress yourselves.\\nHere are two new suits of clothes--shirts, socks, everything complete.\\nThey\\'re Huck\\'s--no, no thanks, Huck--Mr.\\nJones bought one and I the other.\\nBut they\\'ll fit both of you.\\nGet into them.\\nWe\\'ll wait--come down when you are slicked up enough.\"\\nThen she left.\\nThe window ain\\'t high from the ground.\"\\n\"Shucks!\\nwhat do you want to slope for?\"\\n\"Well, I ain\\'t used to that kind of a crowd.\\nI can\\'t stand it.\\nI ain\\'t going down there, Tom.\"\\n\"Oh, bother!\\nIt ain\\'t anything.\\nI don\\'t mind it a bit.\\nI\\'ll take care of you.\"\\nSid appeared.\\n\"Tom.\"\\nsaid he, \"auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.\\nMary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody\\'s been fretting about you.\\nSay--ain\\'t this grease and clay, on your clothes?\"\\n\"Now, Mr.\\nSiddy, you jist \\'tend to your own business.\\nWhat\\'s all this blowout about, anyway?\"\\n\"It\\'s one of the widow\\'s parties that she\\'s always having.\\nThis time it\\'s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night.\\nAnd say--I can tell you something, if you want to know.\"\\n\"Well, what?\"\\n\"Why, old Mr.\\nJones is going to try to spring something on the people here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a secret, but I reckon it\\'s not much of a secret now.\\nEverybody knows--the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don\\'t.\\nMr.\\nJones was bound Huck should be here--couldn\\'t get along with his grand secret without Huck, you know.\"\\n\"Secret about what, Sid?\"\\n\"About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow\\'s.\\nI reckon Mr.\\nJones was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop pretty flat.\"\\nSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.\\n\"Sid, was it you that told?\"\\n\"Oh, never mind who it was.\\n_Somebody_ told--that\\'s enough.\"\\n\"Sid, there\\'s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and that\\'s you.\\nIf you had been in Huck\\'s place you\\'d \\'a\\' sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers.\\nYou can\\'t do any but mean things, and you can\\'t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.\\nThere--no thanks, as the widow says\"--and Tom cuffed Sid\\'s ears and helped him to the door with several kicks.\\n\"Now go and tell auntie if you dare--and tomorrow you\\'ll catch it.\"\\nSome minutes later the widow\\'s guests were at the supper-table, and a dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room, after the fashion of that country and that day.\\nAt the proper time Mr.\\nJones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was another person whose modesty--  And so forth and so on.\\nHe sprung his secret about Huck\\'s share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances.\\nHowever, the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody\\'s gaze and everybody\\'s laudations.\\nThe widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way.\\nTom\\'s chance was come.\\nHe said:  \"Huck don\\'t need it.\\nHuck\\'s rich.\"\\nNothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke.\\nBut the silence was a little awkward.\\nTom broke it:  \"Huck\\'s got money.\\nMaybe you don\\'t believe it, but he\\'s got lots of it.\\nOh, you needn\\'t smile--I reckon I can show you.\\nYou just wait a minute.\"\\nTom ran out of doors.\\nThe company looked at each other with a perplexed interest--and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.\\n\"Sid, what ails Tom?\"\\nsaid Aunt Polly.\\n\"He--well, there ain\\'t ever any making of that boy out.\\nI never-.\"\\nTom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly did not finish her sentence.\\nTom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said:  \"There--what did I tell you?\\nHalf of it\\'s Huck\\'s and half of it\\'s mine.\"\\nThe spectacle took the general breath away.\\nAll gazed, nobody spoke for a moment.\\nThen there was a unanimous call for an explanation.\\nTom said he could furnish it, and he did.\\nThe tale was long, but brimful of interest.\\nThere was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow.\\nWhen he had finished, Mr.\\nJones said:  \"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it don\\'t amount to anything now.\\nThis one makes it sing mighty small, I\\'m willing to allow.\"\\nThe money was counted.\\nThe sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand dollars.\\nIt was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property.\\nPetersburg.\\nSo vast a sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible.\\nIt was talked about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement.\\nEvery \"haunte.\"\\nhouse in St.\\nPetersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected, plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure--and not by boys, but men--pretty grave, unromantic men, too, some of them.\\nWherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired, stared at.\\nThe boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality.\\nThe village paper published biographical sketches of the boys.\\nThe Widow Douglas put Huck\\'s money out at six per cent., and Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom\\'s at Aunt Polly\\'s request.\\nEach lad had an income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every weekday in the year and half of the Sundays.\\nIt was just what the minister got--no, it was what he was promised--he generally couldn\\'t collect it.\\nA dollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.\\nJudge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom.\\nHe said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave.\\nWhen Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with George Washington\\'s lauded Truth about the hatchet!\\nBecky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that.\\nShe went straight off and told Tom about it.\\nJudge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day.\\nHe said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or both.\\nHuck Finn\\'s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas\\' protection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into it, hurled him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear.\\nThe widow\\'s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend.\\nHe had to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.\\nHe bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up missing.\\nFor forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress.\\nThe public were profoundly concerned; they searched high and low, they dragged the river for his body.\\nEarly the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.\\nHuck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe.\\nHe was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy.\\nTom routed him out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.\\nHuck\\'s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast.\\nHe said:  \"Don\\'t talk about it, Tom.\\nI\\'ve tried it, and it don\\'t work; it don\\'t work, Tom.\\nIt ain\\'t for me; I ain\\'t used to it.\\nThe widder\\'s good to me, and friendly; but I can\\'t stand them ways.\\nShe makes me get up just at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to thunder; she won\\'t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don\\'t seem to any air git through \\'em, somehow; and they\\'re so rotten nice that I can\\'t set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher\\'s; I hain\\'t slid on a cellar-door for--well, it \\'pears to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons!\\nI can\\'t ketch a fly in there, I can\\'t chaw.\\nI got to wear shoes all Sunday.\\nThe widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything\\'s so awful reg\\'lar a body can\\'t stand it.\"\\n\"Well, everybody does that way, Huck.\"\\n\"Tom, it don\\'t make no difference.\\nI ain\\'t everybody, and I can\\'t _stand_ it.\\nIt\\'s awful to be tied up so.\\nAnd grub comes too easy--I don\\'t take no interest in vittles, that way.\\nI got to ask to go a-fishing; I got to ask to go in a-swimming--dern\\'d if I hain\\'t got to ask to do everything.\\nWell, I\\'d got to talk so nice it wasn\\'t no comfort--I\\'d got to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste in my mouth, or I\\'d a died, Tom.\\nThe widder wouldn\\'t let me smoke; she wouldn\\'t let me yell, she wouldn\\'t let me gape, nor stretch, nor scratch, before folks-.\"\\n[Then with a spasm of special irritation and injury]--\"And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time!\\nI never see such a woman!\\nI _had_ to shove, Tom--I just had to.\\nAnd besides, that school\\'s going to open, and I\\'d a had to go to it--well, I wouldn\\'t stand _that_, Tom.\\nLooky-here, Tom, being rich ain\\'t what it\\'s cracked up to be.\\nIt\\'s just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead all the time.\\nNow these clothes suits me, and this bar\\'l suits me, and I ain\\'t ever going to shake \\'em any more.\\nTom, I wouldn\\'t ever got into all this trouble if it hadn\\'t \\'a\\' ben for that money; now you just take my sheer of it along with your\\'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not many times, becuz I don\\'t give a dern for a thing \\'thout it\\'s tollable hard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder.\"\\n\"Oh, Huck, you know I can\\'t do that.\\n\\'Tain\\'t fair; and besides if you\\'ll try this thing just a while longer you\\'ll come to like it.\"\\n\"Like it!\\nYes--the way I\\'d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long enough.\\nNo, Tom, I won\\'t be rich, and I won\\'t live in them cussed smothery houses.\\nI like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and I\\'ll stick to \\'em, too.\\nBlame it all!\\njust as we\\'d got guns, and a cave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all.\"\\nTom saw his opportunity--  \"Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain\\'t going to keep me back from turning robber.\"\\n\"No!\\nOh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?\"\\n\"Just as dead earnest as I\\'m sitting here.\\nBut Huck, we can\\'t let you into the gang if you ain\\'t respectable, you know.\"\\nHuck\\'s joy was quenched.\\n\"Can\\'t let me in, Tom?\\nDidn\\'t you let me go for a pirate?\"\\n\"Yes, but that\\'s different.\\nA robber is more high-toned than what a pirate is--as a general thing.\\nIn most countries they\\'re awful high up in the nobility--dukes and such.\"\\n\"Now, Tom, hain\\'t you always ben friendly to me?\\nYou wouldn\\'t shet me out, would you, Tom?\\nYou wouldn\\'t do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?\"\\n\"Huck, I wouldn\\'t want to, and I _don\\'t_ want to--but what would people say?\\nWhy, they\\'d say, \\'Mph!\\nTom Sawyer\\'s Gang!\\npretty low characters in it!\\' They\\'d mean you, Huck.\\nYou wouldn\\'t like that, and I wouldn\\'t.\"\\nHuck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle.\\nFinally he said:  \"Well, I\\'ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I can come to stand it, if you\\'ll let me b\\'long to the gang, Tom.\"\\n\"All right, Huck, it\\'s a whiz!\\nCome along, old chap, and I\\'ll ask the widow to let up on you a little, Huck.\"\\n\"Will you, Tom--now will you?\\nThat\\'s good.\\nIf she\\'ll let up on some of the roughest things, I\\'ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd through or bust.\\nWhen you going to start the gang and turn robbers?\"\\n\"Oh, right off.\\nWe\\'ll get the boys together and have the initiation tonight, maybe.\"\\n\"Have the which?\"\\n\"Have the initiation.\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\"It\\'s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang\\'s secrets, even if you\\'re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang.\"\\n\"That\\'s gay--that\\'s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.\"\\n\"Well, I bet it is.\\nAnd all that swearing\\'s got to be done at midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha\\'nted house is the best, but they\\'re all ripped up now.\"\\n\"Well, midnight\\'s good, anyway, Tom.\"\\n\"Yes, so it is.\\nAnd you\\'ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with blood.\"\\n\"Now, that\\'s something _like_!\\nWhy, it\\'s a million times bullier than pirating.\\nI\\'ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be a reg\\'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking \\'bout it, I reckon she\\'ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.\"\\nCONCLUSION  SO endeth this chronicle.\\nIt being strictly a history of a _boy_, it must stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a _man_.\\nWhen one writes a novel about grown people, he knows exactly where to stop--that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop where he best can.\\nMost of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are prosperous and happy.\\nSome day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present.\\n\\nProduced by Jose Menendez     A CHRISTMAS CAROL  IN PROSE BEING A Ghost Story of Christmas

Stave   I: Marley\\'s Ghost Stave  II: The First of the Three Spirits Stave III: The Second of the Three Spirits Stave  IV: The Last of the Spirits Stave   V: The End of It    STAVE I:  MARLEY\\'S GHOST  MARLEY was dead: to begin with.\\nThere is no doubt whatever about that.\\nThe register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner.\\nScrooge signed it: and Scrooge\\'s name was good upon \\'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to.\\nOld Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\\nMind!\\nI don\\'t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail.\\nI might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade.\\nBut the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country\\'s done for.\\nYou will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\\nScrooge knew he was dead?\\nOf course he did.\\nHow could it be otherwise?\\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\\'t know how many years.\\nScrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner.\\nAnd even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\\nThe mention of Marley\\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started from.\\nThere is no doubt that Marley was dead.\\nThis must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate.\\nIf we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\\'s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot--say Saint Paul\\'s Churchyard for instance-- literally to astonish his son\\'s weak mind.\\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\\'s name.\\nThere it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley.\\nThe firm was known as Scrooge and Marley.\\nSometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names.\\nIt was all the same to him.\\nOh!\\nBut he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone, Scrooge!\\na squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!\\nHard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.\\nA frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin.\\nHe carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn\\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge.\\nNo warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him.\\nNo wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty.\\nFoul weather didn\\'t know where to have him.\\nThe heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect.\\nThey often \"came dow.\"\\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\\nWhen will you come to see me?\"\\nNo beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o\\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.\\nEven the blind men\\'s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, \"No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master.\"\\nBut what did Scrooge care!\\nIt was the very thing he liked.\\nTo edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call \"nut.\"\\nto Scrooge.\\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house.\\nIt was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.\\nThe city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already-- it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.\\nThe fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\\nTo see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\\nThe door of Scrooge\\'s counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters.\\nScrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\\'s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal.\\nBut he couldn\\'t replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part.\\nWherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.\\n\"A merry Christmas, uncle!\\nGod save you.\"\\ncried a cheerful voice.\\nIt was the voice of Scrooge\\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\\n\"Bah.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"Humbug.\"\\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge\\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\\n\"Christmas a humbug, uncle.\"\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s nephew.\\n\"You don\\'t mean that, I am sure?\"\\n\"I do.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Merry Christmas!\\nWhat right have you to be merry?\\nWhat reason have you to be merry?\\nYou\\'re poor enough.\"\\n\"Come, then.\"\\nreturned the nephew gaily.\\n\"What right have you to be dismal?\\nWhat reason have you to be morose?\\nYou\\'re rich enough.\"\\nScrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, \"Bah.\"\\nagain; and followed it up with \"Humbug.\"\\n\"Don\\'t be cross, uncle.\"\\nsaid the nephew.\\n\"What else can I be.\"\\nreturned the uncle, \"when I live in such a world of fools as this?\\nMerry Christmas!\\nOut upon merry Christmas!\\nWhat\\'s Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in \\'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you?\\nIf I could work my will.\"\\nsaid Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot who goes about with \\'Merry Christmas\\' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.\\nHe should.\"\\n\"Uncle.\"\\npleaded the nephew.\\n\"Nephew.\"\\nreturned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\"\\n\"Keep it.\"\\nrepeated Scrooge\\'s nephew.\\n\"But you don\\'t keep it.\"\\n\"Let me leave it alone, then.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Much good may it do you!\\nMuch good it has ever done you.\"\\n\"There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say.\"\\nreturned the nephew.\\n\"Christmas among the rest.\\nBut I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.\\nAnd therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it.\"\\nThe clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.\\nBecoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.\\n\"Let me hear another sound from you.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"and you\\'ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation!\\nYou\\'re quite a powerful speaker, sir.\"\\nhe added, turning to his nephew.\\n\"I wonder you don\\'t go into Parliament.\"\\n\"Don\\'t be angry, uncle.\\nCome!\\nDine with us to-morrow.\"\\nScrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he did.\\nHe went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.\\n\"But why?\"\\ncried Scrooge\\'s nephew.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Why did you get married?\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Because I fell in love.\"\\n\"Because you fell in love.\"\\ngrowled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas.\\n\"Good afternoon.\"\\n\"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened.\\nWhy give it as a reason for not coming now?\"\\n\"Good afternoon.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?\"\\n\"Good afternoon.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute.\\nWe have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party.\\nBut I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I\\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle.\"\\n\"Good afternoon.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"And A Happy New Year.\"\\n\"Good afternoon.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding.\\nHe stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.\\n\"There\\'s another fellow.\"\\nmuttered Scrooge; who overheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas.\\nI\\'ll retire to Bedlam.\"\\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\\'s nephew out, had let two other people in.\\nThey were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge\\'s office.\\nThey had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him.\\n\"Scrooge and Marley\\'s, I believe.\"\\nsaid one of the gentlemen, referring to his list.\\n\"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr.\\nScrooge, or Mr.\\nMarley?\"\\n\"Mr.\\nMarley has been dead these seven years.\"\\nScrooge replied.\\n\"He died seven years ago, this very night.\"\\n\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner.\"\\nsaid the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits.\\nAt the ominous word \"liberality.\"\\nScrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.\\n\"At this festive season of the year, Mr.\\nScrooge.\"\\nsaid the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.\\nMany thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\"\\n\"Are there no prisons?\"\\nasked Scrooge.\\n\"Plenty of prisons.\"\\nsaid the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\\n\"And the Union workhouses?\"\\ndemanded Scrooge.\\n\"Are they still in operation?\"\\n\"They are.\\nStill.\"\\nreturned the gentleman, \"I wish I could say they were not.\"\\n\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Both very busy, sir.\"\\n\"Oh!\\nI was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"I\\'m very glad to hear it.\"\\n\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude.\"\\nreturned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth.\\nWe choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices.\\nWhat shall I put you down for?\"\\n\"Nothing.\"\\nScrooge replied.\\n\"You wish to be anonymous?\"\\n\"I wish to be left alone.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.\\nI don\\'t make merry myself at Christmas and I can\\'t afford to make idle people merry.\\nI help to support the establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there.\"\\n\"Many can\\'t go there; and many would rather die.\"\\n\"If they would rather die.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\\nBesides--excuse me--I don\\'t know that.\"\\n\"But you might know it.\"\\nobserved the gentleman.\\n\"It\\'s not my business.\"\\nScrooge returned.\\n\"It\\'s enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\\'s.\\nMine occupies me constantly.\\nGood afternoon, gentlemen.\"\\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew.\\nScrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way.\\nThe ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\\nThe cold became intense.\\nIn the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture.\\nThe water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice.\\nThe brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed.\\nPoulterers\\' and grocers\\' trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do.\\nThe Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\\'s household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow\\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.\\nFoggier yet, and colder.\\nPiercing, searching, biting cold.\\nIf the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\\'s nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose.\\nThe owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge\\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of          \"God bless you, merry gentleman!\\nMay nothing you dismay.\"\\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.\\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived.\\nWith an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.\\n\"You\\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"If quite convenient, sir.\"\\n\"It\\'s not convenient.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"and it\\'s not fair.\\nIf I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you\\'d think yourself ill-used, I\\'ll be bound?\"\\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\\n\"And yet.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"you don\\'t think me ill-used, when I pay a day\\'s wages for no work.\"\\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\\n\"A poor excuse for picking a man\\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of December.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin.\\n\"But I suppose you must have the whole day.\\nBe here all the earlier next morning.\"\\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman\\'s-buff.\\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker\\'s-book, went home to bed.\\nHe lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner.\\nThey were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again.\\nIt was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\\nThe yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.\\nThe fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.\\nNow, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large.\\nIt is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including--which is a bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery.\\nLet it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years\\' dead partner that afternoon.\\nAnd then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but Marley\\'s face.\\nMarley\\'s face.\\nIt was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar.\\nIt was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead.\\nThe hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.\\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.\\nBut he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\\nHe did pause, with a moment\\'s irresolution, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley\\'s pigtail sticking out into the hall.\\nBut there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said \"Pooh, pooh.\"\\nand closed it with a bang.\\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder.\\nEvery room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant\\'s cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own.\\nScrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes.\\nHe fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.\\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy.\\nThere was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom.\\nHalf-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn\\'t have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\\'s dip.\\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.\\nDarkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it.\\nBut before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right.\\nHe had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.\\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room.\\nAll as they should be.\\nNobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob.\\nNobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall.\\nLumber-room as usual.\\nOld fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom.\\nThus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night.\\nHe was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.\\nThe fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.\\nThere were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh\\'s daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet\\'s rod, and swallowed up the whole.\\nIf each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley\\'s head on every one.\\n\"Humbug.\"\\nsaid Scrooge; and walked across the room.\\nAfter several turns, he sat down again.\\nAs he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building.\\nIt was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing.\\nIt swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.\\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour.\\nThe bells ceased as they had begun, together.\\nThey were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant\\'s cellar.\\nScrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.\\nThe cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door.\\n\"It\\'s humbug still.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"I won\\'t believe it.\"\\nHis colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes.\\nUpon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know him; Marley\\'s Ghost.\"\\nand fell again.\\nThe same face: the very same.\\nMarley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head.\\nThe chain he drew was clasped about his middle.\\nIt was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.\\nHis body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\\nNo, nor did he believe it even now.\\nThough he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.\\n\"How now.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.\\n\"What do you want with me?\"\\n\"Much!\"--Marley\\'s voice, no doubt about it.\\n\"Who are you?\"\\n\"Ask me who I was.\"\\n\"Who were you then?\"\\nsaid Scrooge, raising his voice.\\n\"You\\'re particular, for a shade.\"\\nHe was going to say \"to a shade.\"\\nbut substituted this, as more appropriate.\\n\"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"\\n\"Can you--can you sit down?\"\\nasked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\\n\"I can.\"\\n\"Do it, then.\"\\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn\\'t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation.\\nBut the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\\n\"You don\\'t believe in me.\"\\nobserved the Ghost.\\n\"I don\\'t.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Why do you doubt your senses?\"\\n\"Because.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them.\\nA slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats.\\nYou may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.\\nThere\\'s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are.\"\\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then.\\nThe truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre\\'s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\\nTo sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him.\\nThere was something very awful, too, in the spectre\\'s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own.\\nScrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.\\n\"You see this toothpick?\"\\nsaid Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision\\'s stony gaze from himself.\\n\"I do.\"\\nreplied the Ghost.\\n\"You are not looking at it.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"But I see it.\"\\nsaid the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"\\n\"Well.\"\\nreturned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation.\\nHumbug, I tell you!\\nhumbug.\"\\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon.\\nBut how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!\\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\\n\"Mercy.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?\"\\n\"Man of the worldly mind.\"\\nreplied the Ghost, \"do you believe in me or not?\"\\n\"I do.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"I must.\\nBut why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?\"\\n\"It is required of every man.\"\\nthe Ghost returned, \"that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death.\\nIt is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is me!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness.\"\\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.\\n\"You are fettered.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, trembling.\\n\"Tell me why?\"\\n\"I wear the chain I forged in life.\"\\nreplied the Ghost.\\n\"I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it.\\nIs its pattern strange to you?\"\\nScrooge trembled more and more.\\n\"Or would you know.\"\\npursued the Ghost, \"the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?\\nIt was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago.\\nYou have laboured on it, since.\\nIt is a ponderous chain.\"\\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.\\n\"Jacob.\"\\nhe said, imploringly.\\n\"Old Jacob Marley, tell me more.\\nSpeak comfort to me, Jacob.\"\\n\"I have none to give.\"\\nthe Ghost replied.\\n\"It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men.\\nNor can I tell you what I would.\\nA very little more is all permitted to me.\\nI cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.\\nMy spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me.\"\\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.\\nPondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\\n\"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob.\"\\nScrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.\\n\"Slow.\"\\nthe Ghost repeated.\\n\"Seven years dead.\"\\nmused Scrooge.\\n\"And travelling all the time.\"\\n\"The whole time.\"\\nsaid the Ghost.\\n\"No rest, no peace.\\nIncessant torture of remorse.\"\\n\"You travel fast?\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"On the wings of the wind.\"\\nreplied the Ghost.\\n\"You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\\n\"Oh!\\ncaptive, bound, and double-ironed.\"\\ncried the phantom, \"not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed.\\nNot to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness.\\nNot to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life\\'s opportunity misused!\\nYet such was I!\\nOh!\\nsuch was I.\"\\n\"But you were always a good man of business, Jacob.\"\\nfaltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.\\n\"Business.\"\\ncried the Ghost, wringing its hands again.\\n\"Mankind was my business.\\nThe common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business.\\nThe dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business.\"\\nIt held up its chain at arm\\'s length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\\n\"At this time of the rolling year.\"\\nthe spectre said, \"I suffer most.\\nWhy did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode!\\nWere there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me.\"\\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.\\n\"Hear me.\"\\ncried the Ghost.\\n\"My time is nearly gone.\"\\n\"I will.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"But don\\'t be hard upon me!\\nDon\\'t be flowery, Jacob!\\nPray.\"\\n\"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell.\\nI have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.\"\\nIt was not an agreeable idea.\\nScrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\\n\"That is no light part of my penance.\"\\npursued the Ghost.\\n\"I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate.\\nA chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\"\\n\"You were always a good friend to me.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Thank\\'ee.\"\\n\"You will be haunted.\"\\nresumed the Ghost, \"by Three Spirits.\"\\nScrooge\\'s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost\\'s had done.\\n\"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?\"\\nhe demanded, in a faltering voice.\\n\"It is.\"\\n\"I--I think I\\'d rather not.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Without their visits.\"\\nsaid the Ghost, \"you cannot hope to shun the path I tread.\\nExpect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.\"\\n\"Couldn\\'t I take \\'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?\"\\nhinted Scrooge.\\n\"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour.\\nThe third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.\\nLook to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us.\"\\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before.\\nScrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage.\\nHe ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.\\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.\\nIt beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.\\nWhen they were within two paces of each other, Marley\\'s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer.\\nScrooge stopped.\\nNot so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory.\\nThe spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity.\\nHe looked out.\\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went.\\nEvery one of them wore chains like Marley\\'s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free.\\nMany had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives.\\nHe had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step.\\nThe misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.\\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell.\\nBut they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.\\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered.\\nIt was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed.\\nHe tried to say \"Humbug.\"\\nbut stopped at the first syllable.\\nAnd being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.\\nSTAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS  WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber.\\nHe was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.\\nSo he listened for the hour.\\nTo his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped.\\nTwelve!\\nIt was past two when he went to bed.\\nThe clock was wrong.\\nAn icicle must have got into the works.\\nTwelve!\\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock.\\nIts rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.\\n\"Why, it isn\\'t possible.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night.\\nIt isn\\'t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon.\"\\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window.\\nHe was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then.\\nAll he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world.\\nThis was a great relief, because \"three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr.\\nEbenezer Scrooge or his order.\"\\nand so forth, would have become a mere United States\\' security if there were no days to count by.\\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.\\nThe more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.\\nMarley\\'s Ghost bothered him exceedingly.\\nEvery time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, \"Was it a dream or not?\"\\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.\\nHe resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.\\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock.\\nAt length it broke upon his listening ear.\\n\"Ding, dong.\"\\n\"A quarter past.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, counting.\\n\"Ding, dong.\"\\n\"Half-past.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Ding, dong.\"\\n\"A quarter to it.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Ding, dong.\"\\n\"The hour itself.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, triumphantly, \"and nothing else.\"\\nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.\\nLight flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand.\\nNot the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed.\\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\\nIt was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child\\'s proportions.\\nIts hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin.\\nThe arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength.\\nIts legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare.\\nIt wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful.\\nIt held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers.\\nBut the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality.\\nFor as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away.\\nAnd in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.\\n\"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\"\\nasked Scrooge.\\n\"I am.\"\\nThe voice was soft and gentle.\\nSingularly low, as if instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.\\n\"Who, and what are you?\"\\nScrooge demanded.\\n\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"\\n\"Long Past?\"\\ninquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish stature.\\n\"No.\\nYour past.\"\\nPerhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.\\n\"What.\"\\nexclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out, with worldly hands, the light I give?\\nIs it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow.\"\\nScrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully \"bonnete.\"\\nthe Spirit at any period of his life.\\nHe then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.\\n\"Your welfare.\"\\nsaid the Ghost.\\nScrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end.\\nThe Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:  \"Your reclamation, then.\\nTake heed.\"\\nIt put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm.\\n\"Rise!\\nand walk with me.\"\\nIt would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time.\\nThe grasp, though gentle as a woman\\'s hand, was not to be resisted.\\nHe rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.\\n\"I am a mortal.\"\\nScrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"\\n\"Bear but a touch of my hand there.\"\\nsaid the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more than this.\"\\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand.\\nThe city had entirely vanished.\\nNot a vestige of it was to be seen.\\nThe darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground.\\n\"Good Heaven.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him.\\n\"I was bred in this place.\\nI was a boy here.\"\\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly.\\nIts gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man\\'s sense of feeling.\\nHe was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten!\\n\"Your lip is trembling.\"\\nsaid the Ghost.\\n\"And what is that upon your cheek?\"\\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\\n\"You recollect the way?\"\\ninquired the Spirit.\\n\"Remember it.\"\\ncried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"\\n\"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years.\"\\nobserved the Ghost.\\n\"Let us go on.\"\\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.\\nSome shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers.\\nAll these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it!\\n\"These are but shadows of the things that have been.\"\\nsaid the Ghost.\\n\"They have no consciousness of us.\"\\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one.\\nWhy was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them!\\nWhy did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past!\\nWhy was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes!\\nWhat was merry Christmas to Scrooge?\\nOut upon merry Christmas!\\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\\n\"The school is not quite deserted.\"\\nsaid the Ghost.\\n\"A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.\"\\nScrooge said he knew it.\\nAnd he sobbed.\\nThey left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it.\\nIt was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\\nFowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.\\nNor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast.\\nThere was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.\\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house.\\nIt opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks.\\nAt one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.\\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading.\\nSuddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\\n\"Why, it\\'s Ali Baba.\"\\nScrooge exclaimed in ecstasy.\\n\"It\\'s dear old honest Ali Baba!\\nYes, yes, I know!\\nOne Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that.\\nPoor boy!\\nAnd Valentine.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"and his wild brother, Orson; there they go!\\nAnd what\\'s his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don\\'t you see him!\\nAnd the Sultan\\'s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head!\\nServe him right.\\nI\\'m glad of it.\\nWhat business had he to be married to the Princess.\"\\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.\\n\"There\\'s the Parrot.\"\\ncried Scrooge.\\n\"Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!\\nPoor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island.\\n\\'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?\\'\\nThe man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn\\'t.\\nIt was the Parrot, you know.\\nThere goes Friday, running for his life to the little creek!\\nHalloa!\\nHoop!\\nHalloo.\"\\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor boy.\"\\nand cried again.\\n\"I wish.\"\\nScrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: \"but it\\'s too late now.\"\\n\"What is the matter?\"\\nasked the Spirit.\\n\"Nothing.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Nothing.\\nThere was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night.\\nI should like to have given him something: that\\'s all.\"\\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, \"Let us see another Christmas.\"\\nScrooge\\'s former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker and more dirty.\\nThe panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you do.\\nHe only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.\\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.\\nScrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her \"Dear, dear brother.\"\\n\"I have come to bring you home, dear brother.\"\\nsaid the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.\\n\"To bring you home, home, home.\"\\n\"Home, little Fan?\"\\nreturned the boy.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsaid the child, brimful of glee.\\n\"Home, for good and all.\\nHome, for ever and ever.\\nFather is so much kinder than he used to be, that home\\'s like Heaven!\\nHe spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you.\\nAnd you\\'re to be a man.\"\\nsaid the child, opening her eyes, \"and are never to come back here; but first, we\\'re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.\"\\n\"You are quite a woman, little Fan.\"\\nexclaimed the boy.\\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.\\nThen she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.\\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master Scrooge\\'s box, there.\"\\nand in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him.\\nHe then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.\\nHere he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of \"somethin.\"\\nto the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\\nMaster Scrooge\\'s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.\\n\"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered.\"\\nsaid the Ghost.\\n\"But she had a large heart.\"\\n\"So she had.\"\\ncried Scrooge.\\n\"You\\'re right.\\nI will not gainsay it, Spirit.\\nGod forbid.\"\\n\"She died a woman.\"\\nsaid the Ghost, \"and had, as I think, children.\"\\n\"One child.\"\\nScrooge returned.\\n\"True.\"\\nsaid the Ghost.\\n\"Your nephew.\"\\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, \"Yes.\"\\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were.\\nIt was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.\\n\"Know it.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Was I apprenticed here.\"\\nThey went in.\\nAt sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:  \"Why, it\\'s old Fezziwig!\\nBless his heart; it\\'s Fezziwig alive again.\"\\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven.\\nHe rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:  \"Yo ho, there!\\nEbenezer!\\nDick.\"\\nScrooge\\'s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-\\'prentice.\\n\"Dick Wilkins, to be sure.\"\\nsaid Scrooge to the Ghost.\\n\"Bless me, yes.\\nThere he is.\\nHe was very much attached to me, was Dick.\\nPoor Dick!\\nDear, dear.\"\\n\"Yo ho, my boys.\"\\nsaid Fezziwig.\\n\"No more work to-night.\\nChristmas Eve, Dick.\\nChristmas, Ebenezer!\\nLet\\'s have the shutters up.\"\\ncried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack Robinson.\"\\nYou wouldn\\'t believe how those two fellows went at it!\\nThey charged into the street with the shutters--one, two, three--had \\'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred \\'em and pinned \\'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.\\n\"Hilli-ho.\"\\ncried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility.\\n\"Clear away, my lads, and let\\'s have lots of room here!\\nHilli-ho, Dick!\\nChirrup, Ebenezer.\"\\nClear away!\\nThere was nothing they wouldn\\'t have cleared away, or couldn\\'t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on.\\nIt was done in a minute.\\nEvery movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter\\'s night.\\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches.\\nIn came Mrs.\\nFezziwig, one vast substantial smile.\\nIn came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable.\\nIn came the six young followers whose hearts they broke.\\nIn came all the young men and women employed in the business.\\nIn came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker.\\nIn came the cook, with her brother\\'s particular friend, the milkman.\\nIn came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.\\nIn they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow.\\nAway they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them!\\nWhen this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well done.\"\\nand the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.\\nBut scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.\\nBut the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind!\\nThe sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\"\\nThen old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs.\\nFezziwig.\\nTop couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.\\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs.\\nFezziwig.\\nAs to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term.\\nIf that\\'s not high praise, tell me higher, and I\\'ll use it.\\nA positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig\\'s calves.\\nThey shone in every part of the dance like moons.\\nYou couldn\\'t have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next.\\nAnd when old Fezziwig and Mrs.\\nFezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.\\nMr.\\nand Mrs.\\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.\\nWhen everybody had retired but the two \\'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop.\\nDuring the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits.\\nHis heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self.\\nHe corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation.\\nIt was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\\n\"A small matter.\"\\nsaid the Ghost, \"to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.\"\\n\"Small.\"\\nechoed Scrooge.\\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so, said,  \"Why!\\nIs it not?\\nHe has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps.\\nIs that so much that he deserves this praise?\"\\n\"It isn\\'t that.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.\\n\"It isn\\'t that, Spirit.\\nHe has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil.\\nSay that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count \\'em up: what then?\\nThe happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"\\nHe felt the Spirit\\'s glance, and stopped.\\n\"What is the matter?\"\\nasked the Ghost.\\n\"Nothing particular.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Something, I think?\"\\nthe Ghost insisted.\\n\"No.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"No.\\nI should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now.\\nThat\\'s all.\"\\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\\n\"My time grows short.\"\\nobserved the Spirit.\\n\"Quick.\"\\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but it produced an immediate effect.\\nFor again Scrooge saw himself.\\nHe was older now; a man in the prime of life.\\nHis face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.\\nThere was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.\\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\\n\"It matters little.\"\\nshe said, softly.\\n\"To you, very little.\\nAnother idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.\"\\n\"What Idol has displaced you?\"\\nhe rejoined.\\n\"A golden one.\"\\n\"This is the even-handed dealing of the world.\"\\nhe said.\\n\"There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth.\"\\n\"You fear the world too much.\"\\nshe answered, gently.\\n\"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach.\\nI have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you.\\nHave I not?\"\\n\"What then?\"\\nhe retorted.\\n\"Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then?\\nI am not changed towards you.\"\\nShe shook her head.\\n\"Am I?\"\\n\"Our contract is an old one.\\nIt was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry.\\nYou are changed.\\nWhen it was made, you were another man.\"\\n\"I was a boy.\"\\nhe said impatiently.\\n\"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are.\"\\nshe returned.\\n\"I am.\\nThat which promised happiness when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two.\\nHow often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say.\\nIt is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.\"\\n\"Have I ever sought release?\"\\n\"In words.\\nNo.\\nNever.\"\\n\"In what, then?\"\\n\"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end.\\nIn everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight.\\nIf this had never been between us.\"\\nsaid the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; \"tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now?\\nAh, no.\"\\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself.\\nBut he said with a struggle, \"You think not.\"\\n\"I would gladly think otherwise if I could.\"\\nshe answered, \"Heaven knows!\\nWhen I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be.\\nBut if you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow?\\nI do; and I release you.\\nWith a full heart, for the love of him you once were.\"\\nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed.\\n\"You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have pain in this.\\nA very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke.\\nMay you be happy in the life you have chosen.\"\\nShe left him, and they parted.\\n\"Spirit.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"show me no more!\\nConduct me home.\\nWhy do you delight to torture me?\"\\n\"One shadow more.\"\\nexclaimed the Ghost.\\n\"No more.\"\\ncried Scrooge.\\n\"No more.\\nI don\\'t wish to see it.\\nShow me no more.\"\\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next.\\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort.\\nNear to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty.\\nThe consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly.\\nWhat would I not have given to be one of them!\\nThough I never could have been so rude, no, no!\\nI wouldn\\'t for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn\\'t have plucked it off, God bless my soul!\\nto save my life.\\nAs to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn\\'t have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again.\\nAnd yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.\\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents.\\nThen the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!\\nThe scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection!\\nThe shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received!\\nThe terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll\\'s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!\\nThe immense relief of finding this a false alarm!\\nThe joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy!\\nThey are all indescribable alike.\\nIt is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.\\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.\\n\"Belle.\"\\nsaid the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, \"I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.\"\\n\"Who was it?\"\\n\"Guess.\"\\n\"How can I?\\nTut, don\\'t I know?\"\\nshe added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed.\\n\"Mr.\\nScrooge.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nScrooge it was.\\nI passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him.\\nHis partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.\"\\n\"Spirit.\"\\nsaid Scrooge in a broken voice, \"remove me from this place.\"\\n\"I told you these were shadows of the things that have been.\"\\nsaid the Ghost.\\n\"That they are what they are, do not blame me.\"\\n\"Remove me.\"\\nScrooge exclaimed, \"I cannot bear it.\"\\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.\\n\"Leave me!\\nTake me back.\\nHaunt me no longer.\"\\nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.\\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom.\\nHe gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.\\nSTAVE III:  THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS  AWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One.\\nHe felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley\\'s intervention.\\nBut finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed.\\nFor he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous.\\nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects.\\nWithout venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don\\'t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\\nNow, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling.\\nFive minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.\\nAll this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it.\\nAt last, however, he began to think--as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.\\nThis idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door.\\nThe moment Scrooge\\'s hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter.\\nHe obeyed.\\nIt was his own room.\\nThere was no doubt about that.\\nBut it had undergone a surprising transformation.\\nThe walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened.\\nThe crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge\\'s time, or Marley\\'s, or for many and many a winter season gone.\\nHeaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.\\nIn easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty\\'s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.\\n\"Come in.\"\\nexclaimed the Ghost.\\n\"Come in!\\nand know me better, man.\"\\nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit.\\nHe was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit\\'s eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\\n\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.\"\\nsaid the Spirit.\\n\"Look upon me.\"\\nScrooge reverently did so.\\nIt was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur.\\nThis garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice.\\nIts feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles.\\nIts dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air.\\nGirded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.\\n\"You have never seen the like of me before.\"\\nexclaimed the Spirit.\\n\"Never.\"\\nScrooge made answer to it.\\n\"Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?\"\\npursued the Phantom.\\n\"I don\\'t think I have.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"I am afraid I have not.\\nHave you had many brothers, Spirit?\"\\n\"More than eighteen hundred.\"\\nsaid the Ghost.\\n\"A tremendous family to provide for.\"\\nmuttered Scrooge.\\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\\n\"Spirit.\"\\nsaid Scrooge submissively, \"conduct me where you will.\\nI went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working now.\\nTo-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.\"\\n\"Touch my robe.\"\\nScrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.\\nHolly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly.\\nSo did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms.\\nThe house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water.\\nThe sky was gloomy, and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away to their dear hearts\\' content.\\nThere was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\\nFor, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest-- laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong.\\nThe poulterers\\' shops were still half open, and the fruiterers\\' were radiant in their glory.\\nThere were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence.\\nThere were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe.\\nThere were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers\\' benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people\\'s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner.\\nThe very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.\\nThe Grocers\\'!\\noh, the Grocers\\'!\\nnearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses!\\nIt was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious.\\nNor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.\\nBut soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces.\\nAnd at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers\\' shops.\\nThe sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker\\'s doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch.\\nAnd it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly.\\nFor they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day.\\nAnd so it was!\\nGod love it, so it was!\\nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker\\'s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.\\n\"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?\"\\nasked Scrooge.\\n\"There is.\\nMy own.\"\\n\"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\"\\nasked Scrooge.\\n\"To any kindly given.\\nTo a poor one most.\"\\n\"Why to a poor one most?\"\\nasked Scrooge.\\n\"Because it needs it most.\"\\n\"Spirit.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, after a moment\\'s thought, \"I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people\\'s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.\"\\n\"I.\"\\ncried the Spirit.\\n\"You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\"I.\"\\ncried the Spirit.\\n\"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"And it comes to the same thing.\"\\n\"I seek.\"\\nexclaimed the Spirit.\\n\"Forgive me if I am wrong.\\nIt has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"There are some upon this earth of yours.\"\\nreturned the Spirit, \"who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived.\\nRemember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.\"\\nScrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town.\\nIt was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker\\'s), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.\\nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge\\'s clerk\\'s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit\\'s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch.\\nThink of that!\\nBob had but fifteen \"Bo.\"\\na-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\\nThen up rose Mrs.\\nCratchit, Cratchit\\'s wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob\\'s private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.\\nAnd now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker\\'s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.\\n\"What has ever got your precious father then?\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nCratchit.\\n\"And your brother, Tiny Tim!\\nAnd Martha warn\\'t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?\"\\n\"Here\\'s Martha, mother.\"\\nsaid a girl, appearing as she spoke.\\n\"Here\\'s Martha, mother.\"\\ncried the two young Cratchits.\\n\"Hurrah!\\nThere\\'s such a goose, Martha.\"\\n\"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.\\n\"We\\'d a deal of work to finish up last night.\"\\nreplied the girl, \"and had to clear away this morning, mother.\"\\n\"Well!\\nNever mind so long as you are come.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nCratchit.\\n\"Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye.\"\\n\"No, no!\\nThere\\'s father coming.\"\\ncried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once.\\n\"Hide, Martha, hide.\"\\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder.\\nAlas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\\n\"Why, where\\'s our Martha?\"\\ncried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\\n\"Not coming.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nCratchit.\\n\"Not coming.\"\\nsaid Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim\\'s blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant.\\n\"Not coming upon Christmas Day.\"\\nMartha didn\\'t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\\n\"And how did little Tim behave?\"\\nasked Mrs.\\nCratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart\\'s content.\\n\"As good as gold.\"\\nsaid Bob, \"and better.\\nSomehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard.\\nHe told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see.\"\\nBob\\'s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.\\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was something very like it in that house.\\nMrs.\\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped.\\nAt last the dishes were set on, and grace was said.\\nIt was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.\\nCratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\\nThere never was such a goose.\\nBob said he didn\\'t believe there ever was such a goose cooked.\\nIts tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration.\\nEked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs.\\nCratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn\\'t ate it all at last!\\nYet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows!\\nBut now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs.\\nCratchit left the room alone--too nervous to bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.\\nSuppose it should not be done enough!\\nSuppose it should break in turning out!\\nSuppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid!\\nAll sorts of horrors were supposed.\\nHallo!\\nA great deal of steam!\\nThe pudding was out of the copper.\\nA smell like a washing-day!\\nThat was the cloth.\\nA smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook\\'s next door to each other, with a laundress\\'s next door to that!\\nThat was the pudding!\\nIn half a minute Mrs.\\nCratchit entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\\nOh, a wonderful pudding!\\nBob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs.\\nCratchit since their marriage.\\nMrs.\\nCratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family.\\nIt would have been flat heresy to do so.\\nAny Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing.\\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up.\\nThe compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire.\\nThen all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit\\'s elbow stood the family display of glass.\\nTwo tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.\\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily.\\nThen Bob proposed:  \"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears.\\nGod bless us.\"\\nWhich all the family re-echoed.\\n\"God bless us every one.\"\\nsaid Tiny Tim, the last of all.\\nHe sat very close to his father\\'s side upon his little stool.\\nBob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\\n\"Spirit.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, \"tell me if Tiny Tim will live.\"\\n\"I see a vacant seat.\"\\nreplied the Ghost, \"in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved.\\nIf these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.\"\\n\"No, no.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Oh, no, kind Spirit!\\nsay he will be spared.\"\\n\"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race.\"\\nreturned the Ghost, \"will find him here.\\nWhat then?\\nIf he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\"\\nScrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\\n\"Man.\"\\nsaid the Ghost, \"if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is.\\nWill you decide what men shall live, what men shall die?\\nIt may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man\\'s child.\\nOh God!\\nto hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust.\"\\nScrooge bent before the Ghost\\'s rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground.\\nBut he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name.\\n\"Mr.\\nScrooge.\"\\nsaid Bob; \"I\\'ll give you Mr.\\nScrooge, the Founder of the Feast.\"\\n\"The Founder of the Feast indeed.\"\\ncried Mrs.\\nCratchit, reddening.\\n\"I wish I had him here.\\nI\\'d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he\\'d have a good appetite for it.\"\\n\"My dear.\"\\nsaid Bob, \"the children!\\nChristmas Day.\"\\n\"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure.\"\\nsaid she, \"on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr.\\nScrooge.\\nYou know he is, Robert!\\nNobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow.\"\\n\"My dear.\"\\nwas Bob\\'s mild answer, \"Christmas Day.\"\\n\"I\\'ll drink his health for your sake and the Day\\'s.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nCratchit, \"not for his.\\nLong life to him!\\nA merry Christmas and a happy new year!\\nHe\\'ll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt.\"\\nThe children drank the toast after her.\\nIt was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness.\\nTiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn\\'t care twopence for it.\\nScrooge was the Ogre of the family.\\nThe mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.\\nAfter it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with.\\nBob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly.\\nThe two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter\\'s being a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income.\\nMartha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner\\'s, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home.\\nAlso how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord \"was much about as tall as Peter.\"\\nat which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn\\'t have seen his head if you had been there.\\nAll this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.\\nThere was nothing of high mark in this.\\nThey were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker\\'s.\\nBut, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit\\'s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.\\nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful.\\nHere, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\\nThere all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them.\\nHere, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour\\'s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!\\nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high.\\nBlessings on it, how the Ghost exulted!\\nHow it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach!\\nThe very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas!\\nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.\\nDown in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.\\n\"What place is this?\"\\nasked Scrooge.\\n\"A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth.\"\\nreturned the Spirit.\\n\"But they know me.\\nSee.\"\\nA light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it.\\nPassing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire.\\nAn old, old man and woman, with their children and their children\\'s children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a boy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.\\nSo surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.\\nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither?\\nNot to sea?\\nTo sea.\\nTo Scrooge\\'s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\\nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.\\nGreat heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds --born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.\\nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea.\\nJoining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.\\nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea --on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship.\\nThey stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it.\\nAnd every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh.\\nIt was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew\\'s and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\\n\"Ha, ha.\"\\nlaughed Scrooge\\'s nephew.\\n\"Ha, ha, ha.\"\\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge\\'s nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too.\\nIntroduce him to me, and I\\'ll cultivate his acquaintance.\\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour.\\nWhen Scrooge\\'s nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge\\'s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he.\\nAnd their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\\n\"Ha, ha!\\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\"\\n\"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live.\"\\ncried Scrooge\\'s nephew.\\n\"He believed it too.\"\\n\"More shame for him, Fred.\"\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s niece, indignantly.\\nBless those women; they never do anything by halves.\\nThey are always in earnest.\\nShe was very pretty: exceedingly pretty.\\nWith a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature\\'s head.\\nAltogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too.\\nOh, perfectly satisfactory.\\n\"He\\'s a comical old fellow.\"\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s nephew, \"that\\'s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be.\\nHowever, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure he is very rich, Fred.\"\\nhinted Scrooge\\'s niece.\\n\"At least you always tell me so.\"\\n\"What of that, my dear.\"\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s nephew.\\n\"His wealth is of no use to him.\\nHe don\\'t do any good with it.\\nHe don\\'t make himself comfortable with it.\\nHe hasn\\'t the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is ever going to benefit US with it.\"\\n\"I have no patience with him.\"\\nobserved Scrooge\\'s niece.\\nScrooge\\'s niece\\'s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\\n\"Oh, I have.\"\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s nephew.\\n\"I am sorry for him; I couldn\\'t be angry with him if I tried.\\nWho suffers by his ill whims!\\nHimself, always.\\nHere, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won\\'t come and dine with us.\\nWhat\\'s the consequence?\\nHe don\\'t lose much of a dinner.\"\\n\"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner.\"\\ninterrupted Scrooge\\'s niece.\\nEverybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.\\n\"Well!\\nI\\'m very glad to hear it.\"\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s nephew, \"because I haven\\'t great faith in these young housekeepers.\\nWhat do you say, Topper?\"\\nTopper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge\\'s niece\\'s sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject.\\nWhereat Scrooge\\'s niece\\'s sister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.\\n\"Do go on, Fred.\"\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s niece, clapping her hands.\\n\"He never finishes what he begins to say!\\nHe is such a ridiculous fellow.\"\\nScrooge\\'s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.\\n\"I was only going to say.\"\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s nephew, \"that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.\\nI am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers.\\nI mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him.\\nHe may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can\\'t help thinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\\nIf it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that\\'s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.\"\\nIt was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\\nBut being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.\\nAfter tea, they had some music.\\nFor they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it.\\nScrooge\\'s niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past.\\nWhen this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton\\'s spade that buried Jacob Marley.\\nBut they didn\\'t devote the whole evening to music.\\nAfter a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.\\nStop!\\nThere was first a game at blind-man\\'s buff.\\nOf course there was.\\nAnd I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots.\\nMy opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge\\'s nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it.\\nThe way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature.\\nKnocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he!\\nHe always knew where the plump sister was.\\nHe wouldn\\'t catch anybody else.\\nIf you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.\\nShe often cried out that it wasn\\'t fair; and it really was not.\\nBut when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable.\\nFor his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous!\\nNo doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains.\\nScrooge\\'s niece was not one of the blind-man\\'s buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her.\\nBut she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.\\nLikewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge\\'s nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\\nThere might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.\\nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed.\\nBut this the Spirit said could not be done.\\n\"Here is a new game.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"One half hour, Spirit, only one.\"\\nIt was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge\\'s nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was.\\nThe brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn\\'t made a show of, and wasn\\'t led by anybody, and didn\\'t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear.\\nAt every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp.\\nAt last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:  \"I have found it out!\\nI know what it is, Fred!\\nI know what it is.\"\\n\"What is it?\"\\ncried Fred.\\n\"It\\'s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge.\"\\nWhich it certainly was.\\nAdmiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to \"Is it a bear?\"\\nought to have been \"Yes.\"\\ninasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr.\\nScrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.\\n\"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure.\"\\nsaid Fred, \"and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health.\\nHere is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, \\'Uncle Scrooge!.\"\\n\"Well!\\nUncle Scrooge.\"\\nthey cried.\\n\"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is.\"\\nsaid Scrooge\\'s nephew.\\n\"He wouldn\\'t take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless.\\nUncle Scrooge.\"\\nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time.\\nBut the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.\\nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end.\\nThe Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich.\\nIn almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery\\'s every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\\nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together.\\nIt was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older.\\nScrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children\\'s Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey.\\n\"Are spirits\\' lives so short?\"\\nasked Scrooge.\\n\"My life upon this globe, is very brief.\"\\nreplied the Ghost.\\n\"It ends to-night.\"\\n\"To-night.\"\\ncried Scrooge.\\n\"To-night at midnight.\\nHark!\\nThe time is drawing near.\"\\nThe chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.\\n\"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit\\'s robe, \"but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts.\\nIs it a foot or a claw?\"\\n\"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it.\"\\nwas the Spirit\\'s sorrowful reply.\\n\"Look here.\"\\nFrom the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable.\\nThey knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.\\n\"Oh, Man!\\nlook here.\\nLook, look, down here.\"\\nexclaimed the Ghost.\\nThey were a boy and girl.\\nYellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility.\\nWhere graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds.\\nWhere angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing.\\nNo change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.\\nScrooge started back, appalled.\\nHaving them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\\n\"Spirit!\\nare they yours?\"\\nScrooge could say no more.\\n\"They are Man\\'s.\"\\nsaid the Spirit, looking down upon them.\\n\"And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.\\nThis boy is Ignorance.\\nThis girl is Want.\\nBeware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.\\nDeny it.\"\\ncried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city.\\n\"Slander those who tell it ye!\\nAdmit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.\\nAnd bide the end.\"\\n\"Have they no refuge or resource?\"\\ncried Scrooge.\\n\"Are there no prisons?\"\\nsaid the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words.\\n\"Are there no workhouses?\"\\nThe bell struck twelve.\\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.\\nAs the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.\\nSTAVE IV:  THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS  THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached.\\nWhen it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand.\\nBut for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.\\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread.\\nHe knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\\n\"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\\n\"You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us.\"\\nScrooge pursued.\\n\"Is that so, Spirit?\"\\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.\\nThat was the only answer he received.\\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it.\\nThe Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.\\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this.\\nIt thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.\\n\"Ghost of the Future.\"\\nhe exclaimed, \"I fear you more than any spectre I have seen.\\nBut as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart.\\nWill you not speak to me?\"\\nIt gave him no reply.\\nThe hand was pointed straight before them.\\n\"Lead on.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Lead on!\\nThe night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know.\\nLead on, Spirit.\"\\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.\\nScrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him along.\\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act.\\nBut there they were, in the heart of it; on \\'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.\\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.\\nObserving that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.\\n\"No.\"\\nsaid a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \"I don\\'t know much about it, either way.\\nI only know he\\'s dead.\"\\n\"When did he die?\"\\ninquired another.\\n\"Last night, I believe.\"\\n\"Why, what was the matter with him?\"\\nasked a third, taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box.\\n\"I thought he\\'d never die.\"\\n\"God knows.\"\\nsaid the first, with a yawn.\\n\"What has he done with his money?\"\\nasked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.\\n\"I haven\\'t heard.\"\\nsaid the man with the large chin, yawning again.\\n\"Left it to his company, perhaps.\\nHe hasn\\'t left it to me.\\nThat\\'s all I know.\"\\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\\n\"It\\'s likely to be a very cheap funeral.\"\\nsaid the same speaker; \"for upon my life I don\\'t know of anybody to go to it.\\nSuppose we make up a party and volunteer?\"\\n\"I don\\'t mind going if a lunch is provided.\"\\nobserved the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose.\\n\"But I must be fed, if I make one.\"\\nAnother laugh.\\n\"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all.\"\\nsaid the first speaker, \"for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch.\\nBut I\\'ll offer to go, if anybody else will.\\nWhen I come to think of it, I\\'m not at all sure that I wasn\\'t his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met.\\nBye, bye.\"\\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.\\nScrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\\nThe Phantom glided on into a street.\\nIts finger pointed to two persons meeting.\\nScrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.\\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly.\\nThey were men of business: very wealthy, and of great importance.\\nHe had made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.\\n\"How are you?\"\\nsaid one.\\n\"How are you?\"\\nreturned the other.\\n\"Well.\"\\nsaid the first.\\n\"Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\"\\n\"So I am told.\"\\nreturned the second.\\n\"Cold, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Seasonable for Christmas time.\\nYou\\'re not a skater, I suppose?\"\\n\"No.\\nNo.\\nSomething else to think of.\\nGood morning.\"\\nNot another word.\\nThat was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.\\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.\\nThey could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost\\'s province was the Future.\\nNor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them.\\nBut nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared.\\nFor he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy.\\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch.\\nIt gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this.\\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand.\\nWhen he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly.\\nIt made him shudder, and feel very cold.\\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute.\\nThe ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.\\nAlleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought.\\nUpon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds.\\nSecrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones.\\nSitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop.\\nBut she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other.\\nAfter a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\\n\"Let the charwoman alone to be the first.\"\\ncried she who had entered first.\\n\"Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker\\'s man alone to be the third.\\nLook here, old Joe, here\\'s a chance!\\nIf we haven\\'t all three met here without meaning it.\"\\n\"You couldn\\'t have met in a better place.\"\\nsaid old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth.\\n\"Come into the parlour.\\nYou were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an\\'t strangers.\\nStop till I shut the door of the shop.\\nAh!\\nHow it skreeks!\\nThere an\\'t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I\\'m sure there\\'s no such old bones here, as mine.\\nHa, ha!\\nWe\\'re all suitable to our calling, we\\'re well matched.\\nCome into the parlour.\\nCome into the parlour.\"\\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags.\\nThe old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.\\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\\n\"What odds then!\\nWhat odds, Mrs.\\nDilber?\"\\nsaid the woman.\\n\"Every person has a right to take care of themselves.\\nHe always did.\"\\n\"That\\'s true, indeed.\"\\nsaid the laundress.\\n\"No man more so.\"\\n\"Why then, don\\'t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who\\'s the wiser?\\nWe\\'re not going to pick holes in each other\\'s coats, I suppose?\"\\n\"No, indeed.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nDilber and the man together.\\n\"We should hope not.\"\\n\"Very well, then.\"\\ncried the woman.\\n\"That\\'s enough.\\nWho\\'s the worse for the loss of a few things like these?\\nNot a dead man, I suppose.\"\\n\"No, indeed.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nDilber, laughing.\\n\"If he wanted to keep \\'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw.\"\\npursued the woman, \"why wasn\\'t he natural in his lifetime?\\nIf he had been, he\\'d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.\"\\n\"It\\'s the truest word that ever was spoke.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nDilber.\\n\"It\\'s a judgment on him.\"\\n\"I wish it was a little heavier judgment.\"\\nreplied the woman; \"and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else.\\nOpen that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it.\\nSpeak out plain.\\nI\\'m not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it.\\nWe know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe.\\nIt\\'s no sin.\\nOpen the bundle, Joe.\"\\nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder.\\nIt was not extensive.\\nA seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all.\\nThey were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come.\\n\"That\\'s your account.\"\\nsaid Joe, \"and I wouldn\\'t give another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it.\\nWho\\'s next?\"\\nMrs.\\nDilber was next.\\nSheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots.\\nHer account was stated on the wall in the same manner.\\n\"I always give too much to ladies.\\nIt\\'s a weakness of mine, and that\\'s the way I ruin myself.\"\\nsaid old Joe.\\n\"That\\'s your account.\\nIf you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I\\'d repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.\"\\n\"And now undo my bundle, Joe.\"\\nsaid the first woman.\\nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.\\n\"What do you call this?\"\\nsaid Joe.\\n\"Bed-curtains.\"\\n\"Ah.\"\\nreturned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms.\\n\"Bed-curtains.\"\\n\"You don\\'t mean to say you took \\'em down, rings and all, with him lying there?\"\\nsaid Joe.\\n\"Yes I do.\"\\nreplied the woman.\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"You were born to make your fortune.\"\\nsaid Joe, \"and you\\'ll certainly do it.\"\\n\"I certainly shan\\'t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe.\"\\nreturned the woman coolly.\\n\"Don\\'t drop that oil upon the blankets, now.\"\\n\"His blankets?\"\\nasked Joe.\\n\"Whose else\\'s do you think?\"\\nreplied the woman.\\n\"He isn\\'t likely to take cold without \\'em, I dare say.\"\\n\"I hope he didn\\'t die of anything catching?\\nEh?\"\\nsaid old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.\\n\"Don\\'t you be afraid of that.\"\\nreturned the woman.\\n\"I an\\'t so fond of his company that I\\'d loiter about him for such things, if he did.\\nAh!\\nyou may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won\\'t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place.\\nIt\\'s the best he had, and a fine one too.\\nThey\\'d have wasted it, if it hadn\\'t been for me.\"\\n\"What do you call wasting of it?\"\\nasked old Joe.\\n\"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure.\"\\nreplied the woman with a laugh.\\n\"Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again.\\nIf calico an\\'t good enough for such a purpose, it isn\\'t good enough for anything.\\nIt\\'s quite as becoming to the body.\\nHe can\\'t look uglier than he did in that one.\"\\nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror.\\nAs they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man\\'s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.\\n\"Ha, ha.\"\\nlaughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground.\\n\"This is the end of it, you see!\\nHe frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead!\\nHa, ha, ha.\"\\n\"Spirit.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot.\\n\"I see, I see.\\nThe case of this unhappy man might be my own.\\nMy life tends that way, now.\\nMerciful Heaven, what is this.\"\\nHe recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful language.\\nThe room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was.\\nA pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.\\nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom.\\nIts steady hand was pointed to the head.\\nThe cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge\\'s part, would have disclosed the face.\\nHe thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.\\nOh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy dominion!\\nBut of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious.\\nIt is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a man\\'s.\\nStrike, Shadow, strike!\\nAnd see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!\\nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge\\'s ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed.\\nHe thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts?\\nAvarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?\\nThey have brought him to a rich end, truly!\\nHe lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him.\\nA cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone.\\nWhat they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\\n\"Spirit.\"\\nhe said, \"this is a fearful place.\\nIn leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me.\\nLet us go.\"\\nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.\\n\"I understand you.\"\\nScrooge returned, \"and I would do it, if I could.\\nBut I have not the power, Spirit.\\nI have not the power.\"\\nAgain it seemed to look upon him.\\n\"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man\\'s death.\"\\nsaid Scrooge quite agonised, \"show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you.\"\\nThe Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her children were.\\nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked up and down the room; started at every sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play.\\nAt length the long-expected knock was heard.\\nShe hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young.\\nThere was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.\\nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.\\n\"Is it good?\"\\nshe said, \"or bad?\"--to help him.\\n\"Bad.\"\\nhe answered.\\n\"We are quite ruined?\"\\n\"No.\\nThere is hope yet, Caroline.\"\\n\"If he relents.\"\\nshe said, amazed, \"there is!\\nNothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.\"\\n\"He is past relenting.\"\\nsaid her husband.\\n\"He is dead.\"\\nShe was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands.\\nShe prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.\\n\"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week\\'s delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite true.\\nHe was not only very ill, but dying, then.\"\\n\"To whom will our debt be transferred?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know.\\nBut before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor.\\nWe may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline.\"\\nYes.\\nSoften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.\\nThe children\\'s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man\\'s death!\\nThe only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure.\\n\"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death.\"\\nsaid Scrooge; \"or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever present to me.\"\\nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen.\\nThey entered poor Bob Cratchit\\'s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.\\nQuiet.\\nVery quiet.\\nThe noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him.\\nThe mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing.\\nBut surely they were very quiet!\\n\"\\'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them..\"\\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words?\\nHe had not dreamed them.\\nThe boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold.\\nWhy did he not go on?\\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.\\n\"The colour hurts my eyes.\"\\nshe said.\\nThe colour?\\nAh, poor Tiny Tim!\\n\"They\\'re better now again.\"\\nsaid Cratchit\\'s wife.\\n\"It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn\\'t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world.\\nIt must be near his time.\"\\n\"Past it rather.\"\\nPeter answered, shutting up his book.\\n\"But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother.\"\\nThey were very quiet again.\\nAt last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:  \"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.\"\\n\"And so have I.\"\\ncried Peter.\\n\"Often.\"\\n\"And so have I.\"\\nexclaimed another.\\nSo had all.\\n\"But he was very light to carry.\"\\nshe resumed, intent upon her work, \"and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble.\\nAnd there is your father at the door.\"\\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter --he had need of it, poor fellow--came in.\\nHis tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most.\\nThen the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, \"Don\\'t mind it, father.\\nDon\\'t be grieved.\"\\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family.\\nHe looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs.\\nCratchit and the girls.\\nThey would be done long before Sunday, he said.\\n\"Sunday!\\nYou went to-day, then, Robert?\"\\nsaid his wife.\\n\"Yes, my dear.\"\\nreturned Bob.\\n\"I wish you could have gone.\\nIt would have done you good to see how green a place it is.\\nBut you\\'ll see it often.\\nI promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday.\\nMy little, little child.\"\\ncried Bob.\\n\"My little child.\"\\nHe broke down all at once.\\nHe couldn\\'t help it.\\nIf he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were.\\nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.\\nThere was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there, lately.\\nPoor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face.\\nHe was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.\\nThey drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still.\\nBob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr.\\nScrooge\\'s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little--\"just a little down you know.\"\\nsaid Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him.\\n\"On which.\"\\nsaid Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him.\\n\\'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr.\\nCratchit,\\' he said, \\'and heartily sorry for your good wife.\\' By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don\\'t know.\"\\n\"Knew what, my dear?\"\\n\"Why, that you were a good wife.\"\\nreplied Bob.\\n\"Everybody knows that.\"\\nsaid Peter.\\n\"Very well observed, my boy.\"\\ncried Bob.\\n\"I hope they do.\\n\\'Heartily sorry,\\' he said, \\'for your good wife.\\nIf I can be of service to you in any way,\\' he said, giving me his card, \\'that\\'s where I live.\\nPray come to me.\\' Now, it wasn\\'t.\"\\ncried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful.\\nIt really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure he\\'s a good soul.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nCratchit.\\n\"You would be surer of it, my dear.\"\\nreturned Bob, \"if you saw and spoke to him.\\nI shouldn\\'t be at all surprised-- mark what I say!--if he got Peter a better situation.\"\\n\"Only hear that, Peter.\"\\nsaid Mrs.\\nCratchit.\\n\"And then.\"\\ncried one of the girls, \"Peter will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.\"\\n\"Get along with you.\"\\nretorted Peter, grinning.\\n\"It\\'s just as likely as not.\"\\nsaid Bob, \"one of these days; though there\\'s plenty of time for that, my dear.\\nBut however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this first parting that there was among us?\"\\n\"Never, father.\"\\ncried they all.\\n\"And I know.\"\\nsaid Bob, \"I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.\"\\n\"No, never, father.\"\\nthey all cried again.\\n\"I am very happy.\"\\nsaid little Bob, \"I am very happy.\"\\nMrs.\\nCratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands.\\nSpirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God!\\n\"Spectre.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"something informs me that our parting moment is at hand.\\nI know it, but I know not how.\\nTell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?\"\\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed him not himself.\\nIndeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\\n\"This court.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time.\\nI see the house.\\nLet me behold what I shall be, in days to come.\"\\nThe Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.\\n\"The house is yonder.\"\\nScrooge exclaimed.\\n\"Why do you point away?\"\\nThe inexorable finger underwent no change.\\nScrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in.\\nIt was an office still, but not his.\\nThe furniture was not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.\\nThe Phantom pointed as before.\\nHe joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.\\nHe paused to look round before entering.\\nA churchyard.\\nHere, then; the wretched man whose name he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground.\\nIt was a worthy place.\\nWalled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation\\'s death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite.\\nA worthy place!\\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One.\\nHe advanced towards it trembling.\\nThe Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.\\n\"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"answer me one question.\\nAre these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?\"\\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.\\n\"Men\\'s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change.\\nSay it is thus with what you show me.\"\\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.\\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.\\n\"Am I that man who lay upon the bed?\"\\nhe cried, upon his knees.\\nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.\\n\"No, Spirit!\\nOh no, no.\"\\nThe finger still was there.\\n\"Spirit.\"\\nhe cried, tight clutching at its robe, \"hear me!\\nI am not the man I was.\\nI will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse.\\nWhy show me this, if I am past all hope.\"\\nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake.\\n\"Good Spirit.\"\\nhe pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: \"Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me.\\nAssure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life.\"\\nThe kind hand trembled.\\n\"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year.\\nI will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future.\\nThe Spirits of all Three shall strive within me.\\nI will not shut out the lessons that they teach.\\nOh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone.\"\\nIn his agony, he caught the spectral hand.\\nIt sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.\\nThe Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.\\nHolding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom\\'s hood and dress.\\nIt shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.\\nSTAVE V:  THE END OF IT  YES!\\nand the bedpost was his own.\\nThe bed was his own, the room was his own.\\nBest and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in!\\n\"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future.\"\\nScrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed.\\n\"The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me.\\nOh Jacob Marley!\\nHeaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this!\\nI say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees.\"\\nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call.\\nHe had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with tears.\\n\"They are not torn down.\"\\ncried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, \"they are not torn down, rings and all.\\nThey are here--I am here--the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled.\\nThey will be.\\nI know they will.\"\\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance.\\n\"I don\\'t know what to do.\"\\ncried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with his stockings.\\n\"I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy.\\nI am as giddy as a drunken man.\\nA merry Christmas to everybody!\\nA happy New Year to all the world.\\nHallo here!\\nWhoop!\\nHallo.\"\\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there: perfectly winded.\\n\"There\\'s the saucepan that the gruel was in.\"\\ncried Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace.\\n\"There\\'s the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered!\\nThere\\'s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat!\\nThere\\'s the window where I saw the wandering Spirits!\\nIt\\'s all right, it\\'s all true, it all happened.\\nHa ha ha.\"\\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh.\\nThe father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!\\n\"I don\\'t know what day of the month it is.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"I don\\'t know how long I\\'ve been among the Spirits.\\nI don\\'t know anything.\\nI\\'m quite a baby.\\nNever mind.\\nI don\\'t care.\\nI\\'d rather be a baby.\\nHallo!\\nWhoop!\\nHallo here.\"\\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard.\\nClash, clang, hammer; ding, dong, bell.\\nBell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash!\\nOh, glorious, glorious!\\nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his head.\\nNo fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells.\\nOh, glorious!\\nGlorious!\\n\"What\\'s to-day.\"\\ncried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.\\n\"EH?\"\\nreturned the boy, with all his might of wonder.\\n\"What\\'s to-day, my fine fellow?\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"To-day.\"\\nreplied the boy.\\n\"Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.\"\\n\"It\\'s Christmas Day.\"\\nsaid Scrooge to himself.\\n\"I haven\\'t missed it.\\nThe Spirits have done it all in one night.\\nThey can do anything they like.\\nOf course they can.\\nOf course they can.\\nHallo, my fine fellow.\"\\n\"Hallo.\"\\nreturned the boy.\\n\"Do you know the Poulterer\\'s, in the next street but one, at the corner?\"\\nScrooge inquired.\\n\"I should hope I did.\"\\nreplied the lad.\\n\"An intelligent boy.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"A remarkable boy!\\nDo you know whether they\\'ve sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there?--Not the little prize Turkey: the big one?\"\\n\"What, the one as big as me?\"\\nreturned the boy.\\n\"What a delightful boy.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"It\\'s a pleasure to talk to him.\\nYes, my buck.\"\\n\"It\\'s hanging there now.\"\\nreplied the boy.\\n\"Is it?\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Go and buy it.\"\\n\"Walk-ER.\"\\nexclaimed the boy.\\n\"No, no.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"I am in earnest.\\nGo and buy it, and tell \\'em to bring it here, that I may give them the direction where to take it.\\nCome back with the man, and I\\'ll give you a shilling.\\nCome back with him in less than five minutes and I\\'ll give you half-a-crown.\"\\nThe boy was off like a shot.\\nHe must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.\\n\"I\\'ll send it to Bob Cratchit\\'s.\"\\nwhispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh.\\n\"He sha\\'n\\'t know who sends it.\\nIt\\'s twice the size of Tiny Tim.\\nJoe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob\\'s will be.\"\\nThe hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer\\'s man.\\nAs he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye.\\n\"I shall love it, as long as I live.\"\\ncried Scrooge, patting it with his hand.\\n\"I scarcely ever looked at it before.\\nWhat an honest expression it has in its face!\\nIt\\'s a wonderful knocker!--Here\\'s the Turkey!\\nHallo!\\nWhoop!\\nHow are you!\\nMerry Christmas.\"\\nIt was a Turkey!\\nHe never could have stood upon his legs, that bird.\\nHe would have snapped \\'em short off in a minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.\\n\"Why, it\\'s impossible to carry that to Camden Town.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"You must have a cab.\"\\nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried.\\nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don\\'t dance while you are at it.\\nBut if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.\\nHe dressed himself \"all in his best.\"\\nand at last got out into the streets.\\nThe people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile.\\nHe looked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows said, \"Good morning, sir!\\nA merry Christmas to you.\"\\nAnd Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\\nHe had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and said, \"Scrooge and Marley\\'s, I believe?\"\\nIt sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\\n\"My dear sir.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old gentleman by both his hands.\\n\"How do you do?\\nI hope you succeeded yesterday.\\nIt was very kind of you.\\nA merry Christmas to you, sir.\"\\n\"Mr.\\nScrooge?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant to you.\\nAllow me to ask your pardon.\\nAnd will you have the goodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in his ear.\\n\"Lord bless me.\"\\ncried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away.\\n\"My dear Mr.\\nScrooge, are you serious?\"\\n\"If you please.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"Not a farthing less.\\nA great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you.\\nWill you do me that favour?\"\\n\"My dear sir.\"\\nsaid the other, shaking hands with him.\\n\"I don\\'t know what to say to such munifi-.\"\\n\"Don\\'t say anything, please.\"\\nretorted Scrooge.\\n\"Come and see me.\\nWill you come and see me?\"\\n\"I will.\"\\ncried the old gentleman.\\nAnd it was clear he meant to do it.\\n\"Thank\\'ee.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"I am much obliged to you.\\nI thank you fifty times.\\nBless you.\"\\nHe went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure.\\nHe had never dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much happiness.\\nIn the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew\\'s house.\\nHe passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up and knock.\\nBut he made a dash, and did it:  \"Is your master at home, my dear?\"\\nsaid Scrooge to the girl.\\nNice girl!\\nVery.\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\"Where is he, my love?\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\n\"He\\'s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress.\\nI\\'ll show you up-stairs, if you please.\"\\n\"Thank\\'ee.\\nHe knows me.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room lock.\\n\"I\\'ll go in here, my dear.\"\\nHe turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door.\\nThey were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see that everything is right.\\n\"Fred.\"\\nsaid Scrooge.\\nDear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!\\nScrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn\\'t have done it, on any account.\\n\"Why bless my soul.\"\\ncried Fred, \"who\\'s that?\"\\n\"It\\'s I.\\nYour uncle Scrooge.\\nI have come to dinner.\\nWill you let me in, Fred?\"\\nLet him in!\\nIt is a mercy he didn\\'t shake his arm off.\\nHe was at home in five minutes.\\nNothing could be heartier.\\nHis niece looked just the same.\\nSo did Topper when he came.\\nSo did the plump sister when she came.\\nSo did every one when they came.\\nWonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\\nBut he was early at the office next morning.\\nOh, he was early there.\\nIf he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late!\\nThat was the thing he had set his heart upon.\\nAnd he did it; yes, he did!\\nThe clock struck nine.\\nNo Bob.\\nA quarter past.\\nNo Bob.\\nHe was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.\\nScrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.\\nHis hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too.\\nHe was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o\\'clock.\\n\"Hallo.\"\\ngrowled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as he could feign it.\\n\"What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?\"\\n\"I am very sorry, sir.\"\\nsaid Bob.\\n\"I am behind my time.\"\\n\"You are?\"\\nrepeated Scrooge.\\n\"Yes.\\nI think you are.\\nStep this way, sir, if you please.\"\\n\"It\\'s only once a year, sir.\"\\npleaded Bob, appearing from the Tank.\\n\"It shall not be repeated.\\nI was making rather merry yesterday, sir.\"\\n\"Now, I\\'ll tell you what, my friend.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, \"I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer.\\nAnd therefore.\"\\nhe continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again; \"and therefore I am about to raise your salary.\"\\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler.\\nHe had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\\n\"A merry Christmas, Bob.\"\\nsaid Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back.\\n\"A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year!\\nI\\'ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob!\\nMake up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit.\"\\nScrooge was better than his word.\\nHe did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father.\\nHe became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world.\\nSome people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms.\\nHis own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.\\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.\\nMay that be truly said of us, and all of us!\\nAnd so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!\\n\\nProduced by Daniel Lazarus and Jonesey      MOBY DICK; OR THE WHALE  By Herman Melville     Original

As it floundered in the sea.\"\\n--ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH.\\n\"The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture of this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six

he endures from these fresh attacks, the infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous head, and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he rushes at the boats with

whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people\\'s hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.\\nThis is my substitute for pistol and ball.\\nWith a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the

there.\\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.\\nGo from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward.\\nWhat do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.\\nSome leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.\\nBut these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.\\nHow then is this?\\nAre the green fields gone?\\nWhat do they here?\\nBut look!\\nhere come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive.\\nStrange!\\nNothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.\\nNo.\\nThey must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in.\\nAnd there they stand--miles of them--leagues.\\nInlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west.\\nYet here

plunged in his deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.\\nYes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.\\nBut here is an artist.\\nHe desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco.\\nWhat is the chief element he employs?\\nThere stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.\\nDeep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.\\nBut though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd\\'s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd\\'s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.\\nGo visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there!\\nWere Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it?\\nWhy did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach?\\nWhy is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land?\\nWhy did the old Persians hold the sea holy?\\nWhy did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?\\nSurely all this is not without meaning.\\nAnd still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned.\\nBut that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.\\nIt is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger.\\nFor to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.\\nBesides, passengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don\\'t sleep of nights--do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.\\nI abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them.\\nFor my part, I abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever.\\nIt is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\\nAnd as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.\\nIt is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.\\nAnd at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough.\\nIt touches one\\'s sense of honour, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.\\nAnd more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you.\\nThe transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.\\nBut even this wears off in time.\\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks?\\nWhat does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?\\nDo you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance?\\nWho ain\\'t a slave?\\nTell me that.\\nWell, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other\\'s shoulder-blades, and be content.\\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of.\\nOn the contrary, passengers themselves must pay.\\nAnd there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid.\\nThe act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us.\\nBut BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?\\nThe urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.\\nAh!\\nhow cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.\\nFor as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle.\\nHe thinks he breathes it first; but not so.\\nIn much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.\\nBut wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than any one else.\\nAnd, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago.\\nIt came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances.\\nI take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:   \"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.\\n\"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.\\n\"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\"\\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.\\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself.\\nSuch a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.\\nThen the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.\\nWith other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote.\\nI love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.\\nNot ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.\\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\\nThe Carpet-Bag.\\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.\\nQuitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.\\nIt was a Saturday night in December.\\nMuch was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.\\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.\\nFor my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.\\nBesides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre of this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was stranded.\\nWhere else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan?\\nAnd where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?\\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.\\nIt was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.\\nI knew no one in the place.\\nWith anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don\\'t be too particular.\\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \"The Crossed Harpoons\"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there.\\nFurther on, from the bright red windows of the \"Sword-Fish Inn.\"\\nthere came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight.\\nToo expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.\\nBut go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don\\'t you hear?\\nget away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.\\nSo on I went.\\nI now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.\\nSuch dreary streets!\\nblocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb.\\nAt this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted.\\nBut presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open.\\nIt had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.\\nHa!\\nthought I, ha, as the flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah?\\nBut \"The Crossed Harpoons.\"\\nand \"The Sword-Fish?\"--this, then must needs be the sign of \"The Trap.\"\\nHowever, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.\\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.\\nA hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.\\nIt was a negro church; and the preacher\\'s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.\\nHa, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of \\'The Trap!\\'\\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath--\"The Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin.\"\\nCoffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I.\\nBut it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.\\nAs the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\\nIt was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.\\nIt stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul\\'s tossed craft.\\nEuroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.\\n\"In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon.\"\\nsays an old writer--of whose works I possess the only copy extant--\"it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.\"\\nTrue enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest well.\\nYes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house.\\nWhat a pity they didn\\'t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.\\nBut it\\'s too late to make any improvements now.\\nThe universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.\\nPoor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon.\\nEuroclydon!\\nsays old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh!\\nWhat a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights!\\nLet them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\\nBut what thinks Lazarus?\\nCan he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights?\\nWould not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here?\\nWould he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods!\\ngo down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?\\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas.\\nYet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.\\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come.\\nLet us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this \"Spoute.\"\\nmay be.\\nThe Spouter-Inn.\\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.\\nOn one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose.\\nSuch unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched.\\nBut by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast.\\nA boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.\\nYet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant.\\nEver and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--It\\'s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.--It\\'s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.--It\\'s a blasted heath.--It\\'s a Hyperborean winter scene.--It\\'s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.\\nBut at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture\\'s midst.\\nTHAT once found out, and all the rest were plain.\\nBut stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish?\\neven the great leviathan himself?\\nIn fact, the artist\\'s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject.\\nThe picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears.\\nSome were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower.\\nYou shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement.\\nMixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.\\nSome were storied weapons.\\nWith this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset.\\nAnd that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco.\\nThe original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.\\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round--you enter the public room.\\nA still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft\\'s cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.\\nOn one side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world\\'s remotest nooks.\\nProjecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale\\'s head.\\nBe that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale\\'s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it.\\nWithin are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.\\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.\\nThough true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.\\nParallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads\\' goblets.\\nFill to THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS a penny more; and so on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.\\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER.\\nI sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was full--not a bed unoccupied.\\n\"But avast.\"\\nhe added, tapping his forehead, \"you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer\\'s blanket, have ye?\\nI s\\'pose you are goin\\' a-whalin\\', so you\\'d better get used to that sort of thing.\"\\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decent man\\'s blanket.\\n\"I thought so.\\nAll right; take a seat.\\nSupper?--you want supper?\\nSupper\\'ll be ready directly.\"\\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the Battery.\\nAt one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs.\\nHe was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn\\'t make much headway, I thought.\\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room.\\nIt was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord said he couldn\\'t afford it.\\nNothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet.\\nWe were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers.\\nBut the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens!\\ndumplings for supper!\\nOne young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.\\n\"My boy.\"\\nsaid the landlord, \"you\\'ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty.\"\\n\"Landlord.\"\\nI whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer is it?\"\\n\"Oh, no.\"\\nsaid he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.\\nHe never eats dumplings, he don\\'t--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes \\'em rare.\"\\n\"The devil he does.\"\\nsays I.\\n\"Where is that harpooneer?\\nIs he here?\"\\n\"He\\'ll be here afore long.\"\\nwas the answer.\\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \"dark complexione.\"\\nharpooneer.\\nAt any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed before I did.\\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on.\\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without.\\nStarting up, the landlord cried, \"That\\'s the Grampus\\'s crew.\\nI seed her reported in the offing this morning; a three years\\' voyage, and a full ship.\\nHurrah, boys; now we\\'ll have the latest news from the Feegees.\"\\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.\\nEnveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.\\nThey had just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they entered.\\nNo wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the whale\\'s mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.\\nOne complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side of an ice-island.\\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most obstreperously.\\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest.\\nThis man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him.\\nHe stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam.\\nI have seldom seen such brawn in a man.\\nHis face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.\\nHis voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.\\nWhen the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.\\nIn a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry of \"Bulkington!\\nBulkington!\\nwhere\\'s Bulkington?\"\\nand darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\\nIt was now about nine o\\'clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.\\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed.\\nIn fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother.\\nI don\\'t know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping.\\nAnd when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply.\\nNor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.\\nTo be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him.\\nIt was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.\\nI began to twitch all over.\\nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards.\\nSuppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\\n\"Landlord!\\nI\\'ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan\\'t sleep with him.\\nI\\'ll try the bench here.\"\\n\"Just as you please; I\\'m sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it\\'s a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots and notches.\\n\"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I\\'ve got a carpenter\\'s plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I\\'ll make ye snug enough.\"\\nSo saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape.\\nThe shavings flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\\nThe landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven\\'s sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank.\\nSo gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.\\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but that could be mended with a chair.\\nBut it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.\\nI then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\\nBut I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.\\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn\\'t I steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?\\nIt seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.\\nFor who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person\\'s bed, I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.\\nThinks I, I\\'ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long.\\nI\\'ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all--there\\'s no telling.\\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\\n\"Landlord.\"\\nsaid I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep such late hours?\"\\nIt was now hard upon twelve o\\'clock.\\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.\\n\"No.\"\\nhe answered, \"generally he\\'s an early bird--airley to bed and airley to rise--yes, he\\'s the bird what catches the worm.\\nBut to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don\\'t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can\\'t sell his head.\"\\n\"Can\\'t sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?\"\\ngetting into a towering rage.\\n\"Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?\"\\n\"That\\'s precisely it.\"\\nsaid the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn\\'t sell it here, the market\\'s overstocked.\"\\n\"With what?\"\\nshouted I.\\n\"With heads to be sure; ain\\'t there too many heads in the world?\"\\n\"I tell you what it is, landlord.\"\\nsaid I quite calmly, \"you\\'d better stop spinning that yarn to me--I\\'m not green.\"\\n\"May be not.\"\\ntaking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I rayther guess you\\'ll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin\\' his head.\"\\n\"I\\'ll break it for him.\"\\nsaid I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord\\'s.\\n\"It\\'s broke a\\'ready.\"\\nsaid he.\\n\"Broke.\"\\nsaid I--\"BROKE, do you mean?\"\\n\"Sartain, and that\\'s the very reason he can\\'t sell it, I guess.\"\\n\"Landlord.\"\\nsaid I, going up to him as cool as Mt.\\nHecla in a snow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling.\\nYou and I must understand one another, and that too without delay.\\nI come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer.\\nAnd about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree.\\nI now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him.\\nAnd in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I\\'ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.\"\\n\"Wall.\"\\nsaid the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that\\'s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.\\nBut be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin\\' you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of \\'balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he\\'s sold all on \\'em but one, and that one he\\'s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow\\'s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin\\' human heads about the streets when folks is goin\\' to churches.\\nHe wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin\\' out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.\"\\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\\n\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\\n\"He pays reg\\'lar.\"\\nwas the rejoinder.\\n\"But come, it\\'s getting dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it\\'s a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.\\nThere\\'s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it\\'s an almighty big bed that.\\nWhy, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it.\\nBut I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\\nArter that, Sal said it wouldn\\'t do.\\nCome along here, I\\'ll give ye a glim in a jiffy.\"\\nand so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.\\nBut I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed \"I vum it\\'s Sunday--you won\\'t see that harpooneer to-night; he\\'s come to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON\\'T ye come?\"\\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.\\n\"There.\"\\nsaid the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"\\nI turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.\\nThough none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.\\nI then glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale.\\nOf things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman\\'s bag, containing the harpooneer\\'s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.\\nLikewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\\nBut what is this on the chest?\\nI took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.\\nI can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.\\nThere was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.\\nBut could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\\nI put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.\\nI went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life.\\nI tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.\\nAfter thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room thinking.\\nI then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.\\nBut beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer\\'s not coming home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time.\\nAt last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.\\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler.\\nBut I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to.\\nHolding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room.\\nI was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag\\'s mouth.\\nThis accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens!\\nwhat a sight!\\nSuch a face!\\nIt was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.\\nYes, it\\'s just as I thought, he\\'s a terrible bedfellow; he\\'s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.\\nBut at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks.\\nThey were stains of some sort or other.\\nAt first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me.\\nI remembered a story of a white man--a whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them.\\nI concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.\\nAnd what is it, thought I, after all!\\nIt\\'s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin.\\nBut then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing.\\nTo be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun\\'s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\\nHowever, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.\\nNow, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all.\\nBut, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on.\\nPlacing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed it down into the bag.\\nHe now took off his hat--a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\\nThere was no hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.\\nHis bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.\\nHad not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.\\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back.\\nI am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\\nIgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.\\nIn fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms.\\nAs I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years\\' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\\nStill more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.\\nIt was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country.\\nI quaked to think of it.\\nA peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers.\\nHe might take a fancy to mine--heavens!\\nlook at that tomahawk!\\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen.\\nGoing to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days\\' old Congo baby.\\nRemembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner.\\nBut seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be.\\nFor now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons.\\nThe chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.\\nFirst he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze.\\nPresently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.\\nBut the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips.\\nAll these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\\nAt last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.\\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\\nTaking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.\\nThe next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.\\nI sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.\\nBut his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.\\n\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\"\\nAnd so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.\\n\"Landlord, for God\\'s sake, Peter Coffin.\"\\nshouted I.\\n\"Landlord!\\nWatch!\\nCoffin!\\nAngels!\\nsave me.\"\\n\"Speak-e!\\ntell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e.\"\\nagain growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\\nBut thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\\n\"Don\\'t be afraid now.\"\\nsaid he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here wouldn\\'t harm a hair of your head.\"\\n\"Stop your grinning.\"\\nshouted I, \"and why didn\\'t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\\n\"I thought ye know\\'d it;--didn\\'t I tell ye, he was a peddlin\\' heads around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.\\nQueequeg, look here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\"\\n\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.\\n\"You gettee in.\"\\nhe added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side.\\nHe really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way.\\nI stood looking at him a moment.\\nFor all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal.\\nWhat\\'s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself--the man\\'s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\\nBetter sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\\n\"Landlord.\"\\nsaid I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him.\\nBut I don\\'t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.\\nIt\\'s dangerous.\\nBesides, I ain\\'t insured.\"\\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to say--\"I won\\'t touch a leg of ye.\"\\n\"Good night, landlord.\"\\nsaid I, \"you may go.\"\\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\\nThe Counterpane.\\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\\'s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.\\nYou had almost thought I had been his wife.\\nThe counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt.\\nIndeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\\nMy sensations were strange.\\nLet me try to explain them.\\nWhen I was a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.\\nThe circumstance was this.\\nI had been cutting up some caper or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though it was only two o\\'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.\\nI felt dreadfully.\\nBut there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.\\nSixteen hours in bed!\\nthe small of my back ached to think of it.\\nAnd it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.\\nI felt worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.\\nBut she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room.\\nFor several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\\nAt last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness.\\nInstantly I felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\\nMy arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\\nFor what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken.\\nI knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery.\\nNay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it.\\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\\'s pagan arm thrown round me.\\nBut at length all the past night\\'s events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament.\\nFor though I tried to move his arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\\nI now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a snore.\\nI then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.\\nThrowing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage\\'s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby.\\nA pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk!\\n\"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake.\"\\nAt length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him.\\nMeanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature.\\nWhen, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself.\\nThinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are.\\nI pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.\\nNevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don\\'t see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.\\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his boots.\\nWhat under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his boots.\\nBut Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.\\nHe was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners.\\nHis education was not yet completed.\\nHe was an undergraduate.\\nIf he had not been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on.\\nAt last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible.\\nHe complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.\\nAt that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.\\nHe then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.\\nI was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\\nThinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers\\'s best cutlery with a vengeance.\\nAfterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his harpoon like a marshal\\'s baton.\\nBreakfast.\\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly.\\nI cherished no malice towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow.\\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good thing; the more\\'s the pity.\\nSo, if any one man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way.\\nAnd the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.\\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.\\nThey were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.\\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.\\nThis young fellow\\'s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage.\\nThat man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.\\nIn the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.\\nBut who could show a cheek like Queequeg?\\nwhich, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes\\' western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.\\n\"Grub, ho.\"\\nnow cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to breakfast.\\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.\\nNot always, though: Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.\\nBut perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo\\'s performances--this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish.\\nStill, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.\\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man maintained a profound silence.\\nAnd not only that, but they looked embarrassed.\\nYes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas--entire strangers to them--and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains.\\nA curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!\\nBut as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle.\\nTo be sure I cannot say much for his breeding.\\nHis greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him.\\nBut THAT was certainly very coolly done by him, and every one knows that in most people\\'s estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.\\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg\\'s peculiarities here; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare.\\nEnough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.\\nThe Street.\\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts.\\nEven in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.\\nRegent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives.\\nBut New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping.\\nIn these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh.\\nIt makes a stranger stare.\\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious, certainly more comical.\\nThere weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.\\nThey are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.\\nMany are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came.\\nIn some things you would think them but a few hours old.\\nLook there!\\nthat chap strutting round the corner.\\nHe wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.\\nHere comes another with a sou\\'-wester and a bombazine cloak.\\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.\\nNow when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.\\nIn bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers.\\nAh, poor Hay-Seed!\\nhow bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors.\\nNot at all.\\nStill New Bedford is a queer place.\\nHad it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador.\\nAs it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony.\\nThe town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England.\\nIt is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.\\nThe streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.\\nYet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford.\\nWhence came they?\\nhow planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?\\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered.\\nYes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.\\nOne and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea.\\nCan Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?\\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\\nYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.\\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long avenues of green and gold.\\nAnd in August, high in air, the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.\\nSo omnipotent is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation\\'s final day.\\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.\\nBut roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.\\nElsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.\\nThe Chapel.\\nIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman\\'s Chapel, and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.\\nI am sure that I did not.\\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this special errand.\\nThe sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist.\\nWrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.\\nEntering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors\\' wives and widows.\\nA muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm.\\nEach silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable.\\nThe chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit.\\nThree of them ran something like the following, but I do not pretend to quote:--  SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, November 1st, 1836.\\nTHIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.\\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats\\' crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the Off-shore Ground in the PACIFIC, December 31st, 1839.\\nTHIS MARBLE Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES.\\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, AUGUST 3d, 1833.\\nTHIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.\\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me.\\nAffected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.\\nThis savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.\\nWhether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.\\nOh!\\nye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these.\\nWhat bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!\\nWhat despair in those immovable inscriptions!\\nWhat deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave.\\nAs well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.\\nIn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.\\nAll these things are not without their meanings.\\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.\\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me.\\nYes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.\\nBut somehow I grew merry again.\\nDelightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet.\\nYes, there is death in this business of whaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity.\\nBut what then?\\nMethinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.\\nMethinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance.\\nMethinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.\\nMethinks my body is but the lees of my better being.\\nIn fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.\\nAnd therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.\\nThe Pulpit.\\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain.\\nYes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.\\nHe had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry.\\nAt the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February\\'s snow.\\nNo one having previously heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led.\\nWhen he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed.\\nHowever, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\\nThe wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste.\\nHalting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.\\nAt my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\\nFor I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.\\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\\nFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage.\\nNo, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\\nCan it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions?\\nYes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.\\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed from the chaplain\\'s former sea-farings.\\nBetween the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers.\\nBut high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel\\'s face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship\\'s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory\\'s plank where Nelson fell.\\n\"Ah, noble ship.\"\\nthe angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo!\\nthe sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand.\"\\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture.\\nIts panelled front was in the likeness of a ship\\'s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship\\'s fiddle-headed beak.\\nWhat could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this earth\\'s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world.\\nFrom thence it is the storm of God\\'s quick wrath is first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.\\nFrom thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.\\nYes, the world\\'s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.\\nThe Sermon.\\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the scattered people to condense.\\n\"Starboard gangway, there!\\nside away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!\\nMidships!\\nmidships.\"\\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still slighter shuffling of women\\'s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every eye on the preacher.\\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit\\'s bows, folded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea.\\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy--       \"The ribs and terrors in the whale,      Arched over me a dismal gloom,      While all God\\'s sun-lit waves rolled by,      And lift me deepening down to doom.\\n\"I saw the opening maw of hell,      With endless pains and sorrows there;      Which none but they that feel can tell--      Oh, I was plunging to despair.\\n\"In black distress, I called my God,      When I could scarce believe him mine,      He bowed his ear to my complaints--      No more the whale did me confine.\\n\"With speed he flew to my relief,      As on a radiant dolphin borne;      Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone      The face of my Deliverer God.\\n\"My song for ever shall record      That terrible, that joyful hour;      I give the glory to my God,      His all the mercy and the power.\"\\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling of the storm.\\nA brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said: \"Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah--\\'And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah..\"\\n\"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.\\nYet what depths of the soul does Jonah\\'s deep sealine sound!\\nwhat a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!\\nWhat a noble thing is that canticle in the fish\\'s belly!\\nHow billow-like and boisterously grand!\\nWe feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us!\\nBut WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?\\nShipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.\\nAs sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.\\nAs with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God--never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command.\\nBut all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade.\\nAnd if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.\\n\"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him.\\nHe thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth.\\nHe skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that\\'s bound for Tarshish.\\nThere lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here.\\nBy all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.\\nThat\\'s the opinion of learned men.\\nAnd where is Cadiz, shipmates?\\nCadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.\\nBecause Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar.\\nSee ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\\nMiserable man!\\nOh!\\nmost contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas.\\nSo disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck.\\nHow plainly he\\'s a fugitive!\\nno baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux.\\nAt last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger\\'s evil eye.\\nJonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.\\nStrong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.\\nIn their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other--\"Jack, he\\'s robbed a widow.\"\\nor, \"Joe, do you mark him; he\\'s a bigamist.\"\\nor, \"Harry lad, I guess he\\'s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.\"\\nAnother runs to read the bill that\\'s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his person.\\nHe reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him.\\nFrighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.\\nHe will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.\\nSo he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.\\n\"\\'Who\\'s there?\\' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs--\\'Who\\'s there?\\' Oh!\\nhow that harmless question mangles Jonah!\\nFor the instant he almost turns to flee again.\\nBut he rallies.\\n\\'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?\\' Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.\\n\\'We sail with the next coming tide,\\' at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him.\\n\\'No sooner, sir?\\'--\\'Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.\\' Ha!\\nJonah, that\\'s another stab.\\nBut he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.\\n\\'I\\'ll sail with ye,\\'--he says,--\\'the passage money how much is that?--I\\'ll pay now.\\' For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, \\'that he paid the fare thereof\\' ere the craft did sail.\\nAnd taken with the context, this is full of meaning.\\n\"Now Jonah\\'s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.\\nIn this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers.\\nSo Jonah\\'s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah\\'s purse, ere he judge him openly.\\nHe charges him thrice the usual sum; and it\\'s assented to.\\nThen the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold.\\nYet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.\\nHe rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\\nNot a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage.\\n\\'Point out my state-room, Sir,\\' says Jonah now, \\'I\\'m travel-weary; I need sleep.\\' \\'Thou lookest like it,\\' says the Captain, \\'there\\'s thy room.\\' Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key.\\nHearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of convicts\\' cells being never allowed to be locked within.\\nAll dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead.\\nThe air is close, and Jonah gasps.\\nThen, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship\\'s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels\\' wards.\\n\"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah\\'s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung.\\nThe lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.\\nBut that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him.\\nThe floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry.\\n\\'Oh!\\nso my conscience hangs in me!\\' he groans, \\'straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!\\'\\n\"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there\\'s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah\\'s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\\n\"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea.\\nThat ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers!\\nthe contraband was Jonah.\\nBut the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden.\\nA dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break.\\nBut now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah\\'s head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.\\nHe sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him.\\nAye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship--a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep.\\nBut the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, \\'What meanest thou, O, sleeper!\\narise!\\' Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea.\\nBut at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks.\\nWave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.\\nAnd ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.\\n\"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.\\nIn all his cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.\\nThe sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them.\\nThe lot is Jonah\\'s; that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions.\\n\\'What is thine occupation?\\nWhence comest thou?\\nThy country?\\nWhat people?\\nBut mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.\\nThe eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.\\n\"\\'I am a Hebrew,\\' he cries--and then--\\'I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!\\' Fear him, O Jonah?\\nAye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN!\\nStraightway, he now goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still are pitiful.\\nFor when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship.\\nBut all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.\\n\"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind.\\nHe goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.\\nThen Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish\\'s belly.\\nBut observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson.\\nFor sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance.\\nHe feels that his dreadful punishment is just.\\nHe leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple.\\nAnd here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment.\\nAnd how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.\\nShipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.\\nSin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.\"\\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing Jonah\\'s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.\\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.\\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:  \"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me.\\nI have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.\\nAnd now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a pilot of the living God.\\nHow being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.\\nBut God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached.\\nAs we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along \\'into the midst of the seas,\\' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and \\'the weeds were wrapped about his head,\\' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.\\nYet even then beyond the reach of any plummet--\\'out of the belly of hell\\'--when the whale grounded upon the ocean\\'s utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried.\\nThen God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and \\'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;\\' when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean--Jonah did the Almighty\\'s bidding.\\nAnd what was that, shipmates?\\nTo preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood!\\nThat was it!\\n\"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it.\\nWoe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty!\\nWoe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale!\\nWoe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal!\\nWoe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness!\\nWoe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour!\\nWoe to him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!\\nYea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway.\"\\nHe dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm,--\"But oh!\\nshipmates!\\non the starboard hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.\\nIs not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low?\\nDelight is to him--a far, far upward, and inward delight--who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.\\nDelight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him.\\nDelight is to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges.\\nDelight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven.\\nDelight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages.\\nAnd eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O Father!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I die.\\nI have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world\\'s, or mine own.\\nYet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?\"\\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and he was left alone in the place.\\nA Bosom Friend.\\nReturning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time.\\nHe was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.\\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment.\\nHe would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.\\nWith much interest I sat watching him.\\nSavage though he was, and hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable.\\nYou cannot hide the soul.\\nThrough all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.\\nAnd besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim.\\nHe looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor.\\nWhether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one.\\nIt may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington\\'s head, as seen in the popular busts of him.\\nIt had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top.\\nQueequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.\\nConsidering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very strange.\\nBut savages are strange beings; at times you do not know exactly how to take them.\\nAt first they are overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom.\\nI had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.\\nHe made no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.\\nAll this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.\\nHere was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could get there--thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to himself.\\nSurely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.\\nBut, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving.\\nSo soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have \"broken his digester.\"\\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange feelings.\\nI felt a melting in me.\\nNo more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world.\\nThis soothing savage had redeemed it.\\nThere he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits.\\nWild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.\\nAnd those same things that would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me.\\nI\\'ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.\\nI drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile.\\nAt first he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night\\'s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows.\\nI told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.\\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it.\\nThus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town.\\nSoon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.\\nAnd then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly passing between us.\\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan\\'s breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left us cronies.\\nHe seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country\\'s phrase, that we were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be.\\nIn a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.\\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room together.\\nHe made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine.\\nI was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers\\' pockets.\\nI let them stay.\\nHe then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper fireboard.\\nBy certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.\\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church.\\nHow then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood?\\nBut what is worship?\\nthought I.\\nDo you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood?\\nImpossible!\\nBut what is worship?--to do the will of God--THAT is worship.\\nAnd what is the will of God?--to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me--THAT is the will of God.\\nNow, Queequeg is my fellow man.\\nAnd what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?\\nWhy, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.\\nConsequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator.\\nSo I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.\\nBut we did not go to sleep without some little chat.\\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends.\\nMan and wife, they say, there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.\\nThus, then, in our hearts\\' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving pair.\\nNightgown.\\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.\\nYes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans.\\nWe felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the room.\\nThe more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.\\nNothing exists in itself.\\nIf you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more.\\nBut if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm.\\nFor this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich.\\nFor the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air.\\nThen there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed.\\nBecause no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part.\\nUpon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o\\'clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion.\\nNor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk.\\nBe it said, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\\nFor now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then.\\nI no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord\\'s policy of insurance.\\nI was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.\\nWith our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.\\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it.\\nHe gladly complied.\\nThough at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.\\nBiographical.\\nQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and South.\\nIt is not down in any map; true places never are.\\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green sapling; even then, in Queequeg\\'s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two.\\nHis father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors.\\nThere was excellent blood in his veins--royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.\\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father\\'s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands.\\nBut the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father\\'s influence could prevail.\\nBut Queequeg vowed a vow.\\nAlone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island.\\nOn one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water.\\nHiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged not.\\nStruck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make himself at home.\\nBut this fine young savage--this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain\\'s cabin.\\nThey put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.\\nBut like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.\\nFor at bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they were.\\nBut, alas!\\nthe practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father\\'s heathens.\\nArrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost.\\nThought he, it\\'s a wicked world in all meridians; I\\'ll die a pagan.\\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.\\nHence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.\\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.\\nHe answered no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him.\\nBut by and by, he said, he would return,--as soon as he felt himself baptized again.\\nFor the nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans.\\nThey had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.\\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future movements.\\nHe answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.\\nUpon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.\\nHe at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds.\\nTo all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.\\nHis story being ended with his pipe\\'s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.\\nWheelbarrow.\\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade\\'s bill; using, however, my comrade\\'s money.\\nThe grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin\\'s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with.\\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg\\'s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to \"the Moss.\"\\nthe little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf.\\nAs we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.\\nBut we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs.\\nI asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons.\\nTo this, in substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.\\nIn short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers\\' meadows armed with their own scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish them--even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.\\nIt was in Sag Harbor.\\nThe owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house.\\nNot to seem ignorant about the thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf.\\n\"Why.\"\\nsaid I, \"Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would think.\\nDidn\\'t the people laugh?\"\\nUpon this, he told me another story.\\nThe people of his island of Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held.\\nNow a certain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain--this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg\\'s sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten.\\nWell; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride\\'s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of honour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg\\'s father.\\nGrace being said,--for those people have their grace as well as we--though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.\\nSeeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King\\'s own house--the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass.\\n\"Now.\"\\nsaid Queequeg, \"what you tink now?--Didn\\'t our people laugh?\"\\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.\\nHoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river.\\nOn one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear, cold air.\\nHuge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye.\\nSuch is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.\\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings.\\nHow I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that turnpike earth!--that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.\\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\\nHis dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth.\\nOn, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\\nSideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.\\nSo full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.\\nBut there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure.\\nQueequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back.\\nI thought the bumpkin\\'s hour of doom was come.\\nDropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.\\n\"Capting!\\nCapting.\"\\nyelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer; \"Capting, Capting, here\\'s the devil.\"\\n\"Hallo, _you_ sir.\"\\ncried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to Queequeg, \"what in thunder do you mean by that?\\nDon\\'t you know you might have killed that chap?\"\\n\"What him say?\"\\nsaid Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\\n\"He say.\"\\nsaid I, \"that you came near kill-e that man there.\"\\npointing to the still shivering greenhorn.\\n\"Kill-e.\"\\ncried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain, \"ah!\\nhim bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale.\"\\n\"Look you.\"\\nroared the Captain, \"I\\'ll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\"\\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye.\\nThe prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.\\nThe poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness.\\nIt flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.\\nNothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.\\nIn the midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe.\\nThe schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.\\nFor three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.\\nI looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.\\nThe greenhorn had gone down.\\nShooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant\\'s glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.\\nA few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.\\nThe boat soon picked them up.\\nThe poor bumpkin was restored.\\nAll hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon.\\nFrom that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\\nWas there ever such unconsciousness?\\nHe did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.\\nHe only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to himself--\"It\\'s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians.\\nWe cannibals must help these Christians.\"\\nNantucket.\\nNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\\nNantucket!\\nTake out your map and look at it.\\nSee what a real corner of the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.\\nLook at it--a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background.\\nThere is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper.\\nSome gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they don\\'t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day\\'s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles.\\nBut these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red-men.\\nThus goes the legend.\\nIn olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his talons.\\nWith loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters.\\nThey resolved to follow in the same direction.\\nSetting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,--the poor little Indian\\'s skeleton.\\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to the sea for a livelihood!\\nThey first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring\\'s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous and most mountainous!\\nThat Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!\\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland.\\nLet America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer\\'s.\\nFor the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it.\\nMerchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself.\\nThe Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.\\nTHERE is his home; THERE lies his business, which a Noah\\'s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.\\nHe lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps.\\nFor years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.\\nWith the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\\nChowder.\\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.\\nThe landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.\\nIn short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots.\\nBut the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse--our first point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.\\nHowever, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.\\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses\\' ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway.\\nThe horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\\nPerhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving.\\nA sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, TWO of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me.\\nIt\\'s ominous, thinks I.\\nA Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen\\'s chapel; and here a gallows!\\nand a pair of prodigious black pots too!\\nAre these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?\\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.\\n\"Get along with ye.\"\\nsaid she to the man, \"or I\\'ll be combing ye.\"\\n\"Come on, Queequeg.\"\\nsaid I, \"all right.\\nThere\\'s Mrs.\\nHussey.\"\\nAnd so it turned out; Mr.\\nHosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs.\\nHussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.\\nUpon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs.\\nHussey, postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said--\"Clam or Cod?\"\\n\"What\\'s that about Cods, ma\\'am?\"\\nsaid I, with much politeness.\\n\"Clam or Cod?\"\\nshe repeated.\\n\"A clam for supper?\\na cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs.\\nHussey?\"\\nsays I, \"but that\\'s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain\\'t it, Mrs.\\nHussey?\"\\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word \"clam.\"\\nMrs.\\nHussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out \"clam for two.\"\\ndisappeared.\\n\"Queequeg.\"\\nsaid I, \"do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?\"\\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us.\\nBut when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.\\nOh, sweet friends!\\nhearken to me.\\nIt was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.\\nOur appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs.\\nHussey\\'s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.\\nStepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word \"co.\"\\nwith great emphasis, and resumed my seat.\\nIn a few moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?\\nWhat\\'s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?\\n\"But look, Queequeg, ain\\'t that a live eel in your bowl?\\nWhere\\'s your harpoon?\"\\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders.\\nChowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.\\nThe area before the house was paved with clam-shells.\\nMrs.\\nHussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin.\\nThere was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen\\'s boats, I saw Hosea\\'s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod\\'s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs.\\nHussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers.\\n\"Why not?\"\\nsaid I; \"every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why not?\"\\n\"Because it\\'s dangerous.\"\\nsays she.\\n\"Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort\\'nt v\\'y\\'ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night.\\nSo, Mr.\\nQueeque.\"\\n(for she had learned his name), \"I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning.\\nBut the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?\"\\n\"Both.\"\\nsays I; \"and let\\'s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.\"\\nThe Ship.\\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.\\nBut to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little god--and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo\\'s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\\nNow, this plan of Queequeg\\'s, or rather Yojo\\'s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all.\\nI had not a little relied upon Queequeg\\'s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.\\nBut as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair.\\nNext morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.\\nAfter much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years\\' voyages--The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.\\nDEVIL-DAM, I do not know the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.\\nI peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.\\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.\\nShe was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her.\\nLong seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull\\'s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier\\'s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia.\\nHer venerable bows looked bearded.\\nHer masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne.\\nHer ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled.\\nBut to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed.\\nOld Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake\\'s carved buckler or bedstead.\\nShe was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.\\nShe was a thing of trophies.\\nA cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies.\\nAll round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to.\\nThose thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.\\nScorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.\\nThe helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.\\nA noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy!\\nAll noble things are touched with that.\\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.\\nIt seemed only a temporary erection used in port.\\nIt was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale.\\nPlanted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem\\'s head.\\nA triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.\\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship\\'s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command.\\nHe was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.\\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together.\\nSuch eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\\n\"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\"\\nsaid I, advancing to the door of the tent.\\n\"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?\"\\nhe demanded.\\n\"I was thinking of shipping.\"\\n\"Thou wast, wast thou?\\nI see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in a stove boat?\"\\n\"No, Sir, I never have.\"\\n\"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?\\n\"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.\\nI\\'ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that-.\"\\n\"Merchant service be damned.\\nTalk not that lingo to me.\\nDost see that leg?--I\\'ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again.\\nMarchant service indeed!\\nI suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships.\\nBut flukes!\\nman, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?--it looks a little suspicious, don\\'t it, eh?--Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?--Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?\"\\nI protested my innocence of these things.\\nI saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.\\n\"But what takes thee a-whaling?\\nI want to know that before I think of shipping ye.\"\\n\"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.\\nI want to see the world.\"\\n\"Want to see what whaling is, eh?\\nHave ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?\"\\n\"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?\"\\n\"Aye, aye, I thought so.\\nCaptain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\"\\n\"I am mistaken then.\\nI thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.\"\\n\"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that\\'s who ye are speaking to, young man.\\nIt belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew.\\nWe are part owners and agents.\\nBut as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out.\\nClap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.\"\\n\"What do you mean, sir?\\nWas the other one lost by a whale?\"\\n\"Lost by a whale!\\nYoung man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!--ah, ah.\"\\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, \"What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.\"\\n\"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d\\'ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit.\\nSURE, ye\\'ve been to sea before now; sure of that?\"\\n\"Sir.\"\\nsaid I, \"I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant-.\"\\n\"Hard down out of that!\\nMind what I said about the marchant service--don\\'t aggravate me--I won\\'t have it.\\nBut let us understand each other.\\nI have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?\"\\n\"I do, sir.\"\\n\"Very good.\\nNow, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale\\'s throat, and then jump after it?\\nAnswer, quick.\"\\n\"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don\\'t take to be the fact.\"\\n\"Good again.\\nNow then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world?\\nWas not that what ye said?\\nI thought so.\\nWell then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.\"\\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.\\nBut concentrating all his crow\\'s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.\\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean.\\nThe prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.\\n\"Well, what\\'s the report?\"\\nsaid Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye see?\"\\n\"Not much.\"\\nI replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there\\'s a squall coming up, I think.\"\\n\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?\\nDo ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?\\nCan\\'t ye see the world where you stand?\"\\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all this I now repeated to Peleg.\\nSeeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.\\n\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off.\"\\nhe added--\"come along with ye.\"\\nAnd so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.\\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure.\\nIt turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship.\\nPeople in Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest.\\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.\\nFor some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters.\\nThey are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.\\nAnd when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature\\'s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language--that man makes one in a whole nation\\'s census--a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.\\nNor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature.\\nFor all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness.\\nBe sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.\\nBut, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\\nBut unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest.\\nStill, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg.\\nThough refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore.\\nHow now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man\\'s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\\nThis world pays dividends.\\nRising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.\\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master.\\nThey told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.\\nFor a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least.\\nHe never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them.\\nWhen Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.\\nIndolence and idleness perished before him.\\nHis own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character.\\nOn his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.\\nThe space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.\\nHis broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\\n\"Bildad.\"\\ncried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh?\\nYe have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge.\\nHow far ye got, Bildad?\"\\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\\n\"He says he\\'s our man, Bildad.\"\\nsaid Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\\n\"Dost thee?\"\\nsaid Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\\n\"I dost.\"\\nsaid I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\\n\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\"\\nsaid Peleg.\\n\"He\\'ll do.\"\\nsaid Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.\\nBut I said nothing, only looking round me sharply.\\nPeleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship\\'s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table.\\nI began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage.\\nI was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship\\'s company.\\nI was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to.\\nAnd though the 275th lay was what they call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years\\' beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.\\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.\\nBut I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.\\nUpon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship\\'s affairs to these two.\\nAnd I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside.\\nNow while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, \"LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth-.\"\\n\"Well, Captain Bildad.\"\\ninterrupted Peleg, \"what d\\'ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?\"\\n\"Thou knowest best.\"\\nwas the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn\\'t be too much, would it?--\\'where moth and rust do corrupt, but LAY--.\"\\nLAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay!\\nthe seven hundred and seventy-seventh!\\nWell, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.\\nIt was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\\n\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad.\"\\ncried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to swindle this young man!\\nhe must have more than that.\"\\n\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh.\"\\nagain said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\"\\n\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth.\"\\nsaid Peleg, \"do ye hear that, Bildad!\\nThe three hundredth lay, I say.\"\\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, \"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans.\\nThe seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\"\\n\"Thou Bildad.\"\\nroared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.\\n\"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.\"\\n\"Captain Peleg.\"\\nsaid Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can\\'t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\\n\"Fiery pit!\\nfiery pit!\\nye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me.\\nIt\\'s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he\\'s bound to hell.\\nFlukes and flames!\\nBildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I\\'ll--I\\'ll--yes, I\\'ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on.\\nOut of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye.\"\\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg.\\nBut to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing.\\nHe seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways.\\nAs for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.\\n\"Whew.\"\\nhe whistled at last--\"the squall\\'s gone off to leeward, I think.\\nBildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye.\\nMy jack-knife here needs the grindstone.\\nThat\\'s he; thank ye, Bildad.\\nNow then, my young man, Ishmael\\'s thy name, didn\\'t ye say?\\nWell then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.\"\\n\"Captain Peleg.\"\\nsaid I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\\n\"To be sure.\"\\nsaid Peleg.\\n\"Fetch him along, and we\\'ll look at him.\"\\n\"What lay does he want?\"\\ngroaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying himself.\\n\"Oh!\\nnever thee mind about that, Bildad.\"\\nsaid Peleg.\\n\"Has he ever whaled it any?\"\\nturning to me.\\n\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\\n\"Well, bring him along then.\"\\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning\\'s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.\\nHowever, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands.\\nTurning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\\n\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?\\nIt\\'s all right enough; thou art shipped.\"\\n\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\\n\"But I don\\'t think thou wilt be able to at present.\\nI don\\'t know exactly what\\'s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don\\'t look so.\\nIn fact, he ain\\'t sick; but no, he isn\\'t well either.\\nAny how, young man, he won\\'t always see me, so I don\\'t suppose he will thee.\\nHe\\'s a queer man, Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.\\nOh, thou\\'lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear.\\nHe\\'s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn\\'t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.\\nMark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\\'s above the common; Ahab\\'s been in colleges, as well as \\'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales.\\nHis lance!\\naye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle!\\nOh!\\nhe ain\\'t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain\\'t Captain Peleg; HE\\'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king.\"\\n\"And a very vile one.\\nWhen that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?\"\\n\"Come hither to me--hither, hither.\"\\nsaid Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me.\\n\"Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod.\\nNever say it anywhere.\\nCaptain Ahab did not name himself.\\n\\'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.\\nAnd yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic.\\nAnd, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same.\\nI wish to warn thee.\\nIt\\'s a lie.\\nI know Captain Ahab well; I\\'ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man--something like me--only there\\'s a good deal more of him.\\nAye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see.\\nI know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he\\'s been a kind of moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass off.\\nAnd once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it\\'s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one.\\nSo good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name.\\nBesides, my boy, he has a wife--not three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.\\nThink of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab?\\nNo, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities.\"\\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.\\nAnd somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don\\'t know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.\\nAnd yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was.\\nBut I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.\\nHowever, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.\\nThe Ramadan.\\nAs Queequeg\\'s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody\\'s religious obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.\\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects.\\nThere was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that?\\nQueequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and there let him rest.\\nAll our arguing with him would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.\\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no answer.\\nI tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\\n\"Queequeg.\"\\nsaid I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.\\n\"I say, Queequeg!\\nwhy don\\'t you speak?\\nIt\\'s I--Ishmael.\"\\nBut all remained still as before.\\nI began to grow alarmed.\\nI had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.\\nI looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one.\\nI could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more.\\nI was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg\\'s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber.\\nThat\\'s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.\\n\"Queequeg!--Queequeg!\"--all still.\\nSomething must have happened.\\nApoplexy!\\nI tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.\\nRunning down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met--the chamber-maid.\\n\"La!\\nla.\"\\nshe cried, \"I thought something must be the matter.\\nI went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it\\'s been just so silent ever since.\\nBut I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping.\\nLa!\\nla, ma\\'am!--Mistress!\\nmurder!\\nMrs.\\nHussey!\\napoplexy!\"--and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.\\nMrs.\\nHussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.\\n\"Wood-house.\"\\ncried I, \"which way to it?\\nRun for God\\'s sake, and fetch something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe!\\nhe\\'s had a stroke; depend upon it!\"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs.\\nHussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you, young man?\"\\n\"Get the axe!\\nFor God\\'s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it open.\"\\n\"Look here.\"\\nsaid the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; \"look here; are you talking about prying open any of my doors?\"--and with that she seized my arm.\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you?\\nWhat\\'s the matter with you, shipmate?\"\\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the whole case.\\nUnconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--\"No!\\nI haven\\'t seen it since I put it there.\"\\nRunning to a little closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that Queequeg\\'s harpoon was missing.\\n\"He\\'s killed himself.\"\\nshe cried.\\n\"It\\'s unfort\\'nate Stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane--God pity his poor mother!--it will be the ruin of my house.\\nHas the poor lad a sister?\\nWhere\\'s that girl?--there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with--\"no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;\"--might as well kill both birds at once.\\nKill?\\nThe Lord be merciful to his ghost!\\nWhat\\'s that noise there?\\nYou, young man, avast there.\"\\nAnd running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door.\\n\"I don\\'t allow it; I won\\'t have my premises spoiled.\\nGo for the locksmith, there\\'s one about a mile from here.\\nBut avast.\"\\nputting her hand in her side-pocket, \"here\\'s a key that\\'ll fit, I guess; let\\'s see.\"\\nAnd with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas!\\nQueequeg\\'s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\\n\"Have to burst it open.\"\\nsaid I, and was running down the entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.\\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens!\\nthere sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head.\\nHe looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.\\n\"Queequeg.\"\\nsaid I, going up to him, \"Queequeg, what\\'s the matter with you?\"\\n\"He hain\\'t been a sittin\\' so all day, has he?\"\\nsaid the landlady.\\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.\\n\"Mrs.\\nHussey.\"\\nsaid I, \"he\\'s ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.\"\\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain.\\nThere he sat; and all he could do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the slightest way.\\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island.\\nIt must be so; yes, it\\'s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he\\'ll get up sooner or later, no doubt.\\nIt can\\'t last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don\\'t believe it\\'s very punctual then.\\nI went down to supper.\\nAfter sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o\\'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination.\\nBut no; there he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch.\\nI began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head.\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have some supper.\\nYou\\'ll starve; you\\'ll kill yourself, Queequeg.\"\\nBut not a word did he reply.\\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.\\nBut previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on.\\nFor some time, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze.\\nI had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.\\nThink of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had been screwed down to the floor.\\nBut as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person\\'s religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person, because that other person don\\'t believe it also.\\nBut when a man\\'s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him.\\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg.\\n\"Queequeg.\"\\nsaid I, \"get into bed now, and lie and listen to me.\"\\nI then went on, beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.\\nI told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.\\nBesides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.\\nThis is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters.\\nIn one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in.\\nHe said no; only upon one memorable occasion.\\nIt was after a great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o\\'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\\n\"No more, Queequeg.\"\\nsaid I, shuddering; \"that will do.\"\\nfor I knew the inferences without his further hinting them.\\nI had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the victor\\'s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg.\\nBecause, in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did.\\nHe looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.\\nAt last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.\\nHis Mark.\\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their papers.\\n\"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?\"\\nsaid I, now jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\\n\"I mean.\"\\nhe replied, \"he must show his papers.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsaid Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind Peleg\\'s, out of the wigwam.\\n\"He must show that he\\'s converted.\\nSon of darkness.\"\\nhe added, turning to Queequeg, \"art thou at present in communion with any Christian church?\"\\n\"Why.\"\\nsaid I, \"he\\'s a member of the first Congregational Church.\"\\nHere be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.\\n\"First Congregational Church.\"\\ncried Bildad, \"what!\\nthat worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman\\'s meeting-house?\"\\nand so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.\\n\"How long hath he been a member?\"\\nhe then said, turning to me; \"not very long, I rather guess, young man.\"\\n\"No.\"\\nsaid Peleg, \"and he hasn\\'t been baptized right either, or it would have washed some of that devil\\'s blue off his face.\"\\n\"Do tell, now.\"\\ncried Bildad, \"is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy\\'s meeting?\\nI never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord\\'s day.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting.\"\\nsaid I; \"all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational Church.\\nHe is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.\"\\n\"Young man.\"\\nsaid Bildad sternly, \"thou art skylarking with me--explain thyself, thou young Hittite.\\nWhat church dost thee mean?\\nanswer me.\"\\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied.\\n\"I mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother\\'s son and soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in THAT we all join hands.\"\\n\"Splice, thou mean\\'st SPLICE hands.\"\\ncried Peleg, drawing nearer.\\n\"Young man, you\\'d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon.\\nDeacon Deuteronomy--why Father Mapple himself couldn\\'t beat it, and he\\'s reckoned something.\\nCome aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers.\\nI say, tell Quohog there--what\\'s that you call him?\\ntell Quohog to step along.\\nBy the great anchor, what a harpoon he\\'s got there!\\nlooks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right.\\nI say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat?\\ndid you ever strike a fish?\"\\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:--  \"Cap\\'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere?\\nYou see him?\\nwell, spose him one whale eye, well, den.\"\\nand taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad\\'s broad brim, clean across the ship\\'s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.\\n\"Now.\"\\nsaid Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, \"spos-ee him whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.\"\\n\"Quick, Bildad.\"\\nsaid Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.\\n\"Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship\\'s papers.\\nWe must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats.\\nLook ye, Quohog, we\\'ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that\\'s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.\"\\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship\\'s company to which I myself belonged.\\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing, he turned to me and said, \"I guess, Quohog there don\\'t know how to write, does he?\\nI say, Quohog, blast ye!\\ndost thou sign thy name or make thy mark?\"\\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg\\'s obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this:--  Quohog.\\nhis X mark.\\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled \"The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose.\"\\nplaced it in Queequeg\\'s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, \"Son of darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman.\\nSpurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh!\\ngoodness gracious!\\nsteer clear of the fiery pit.\"\\nSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad\\'s language, heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\\n\"Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer.\"\\ncried Peleg.\\n\"Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers--it takes the shark out of \\'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish.\\nThere was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to good.\\nHe got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.\"\\n\"Peleg!\\nPeleg.\"\\nsaid Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, \"thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can\\'st thou prate in this ungodly guise.\\nThou beliest thine own heart, Peleg.\\nTell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did\\'st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?\"\\n\"Hear him, hear him now.\"\\ncried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,--\"hear him, all of ye.\\nThink of that!\\nWhen every moment we thought the ship would sink!\\nDeath and the Judgment then?\\nWhat?\\nWith all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft.\\nThink of Death and the Judgment then?\\nNo!\\nno time to think about Death then.\\nLife was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save all hands--how to rig jury-masts--how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.\"\\nBildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we followed him.\\nThere he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist.\\nNow and then he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted.\\nThe Prophet.\\n\"Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?\"\\nQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.\\nHe was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck.\\nA confluent small-pox had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.\\n\"Have ye shipped in her?\"\\nhe repeated.\\n\"You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose.\"\\nsaid I, trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.\\n\"Aye, the Pequod--that ship there.\"\\nhe said, drawing back his whole arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nsaid I, \"we have just signed the articles.\"\\n\"Anything down there about your souls?\"\\n\"About what?\"\\n\"Oh, perhaps you hav\\'n\\'t got any.\"\\nhe said quickly.\\n\"No matter though, I know many chaps that hav\\'n\\'t got any,--good luck to \\'em; and they are all the better off for it.\\nA soul\\'s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.\"\\n\"What are you jabbering about, shipmate?\"\\nsaid I.\\n\"HE\\'S got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps.\"\\nabruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon the word HE.\\n\"Queequeg.\"\\nsaid I, \"let\\'s go; this fellow has broken loose from somewhere; he\\'s talking about something and somebody we don\\'t know.\"\\n\"Stop.\"\\ncried the stranger.\\n\"Ye said true--ye hav\\'n\\'t seen Old Thunder yet, have ye?\"\\n\"Who\\'s Old Thunder?\"\\nsaid I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner.\\n\"Captain Ahab.\"\\n\"What!\\nthe captain of our ship, the Pequod?\"\\n\"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name.\\nYe hav\\'n\\'t seen him yet, have ye?\"\\n\"No, we hav\\'n\\'t.\\nHe\\'s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be all right again before long.\"\\n\"All right again before long.\"\\nlaughed the stranger, with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh.\\n\"Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.\"\\n\"What do you know about him?\"\\n\"What did they TELL you about him?\\nSay that.\"\\n\"They didn\\'t tell much of anything about him; only I\\'ve heard that he\\'s a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.\"\\n\"That\\'s true, that\\'s true--yes, both true enough.\\nBut you must jump when he gives an order.\\nStep and growl; growl and go--that\\'s the word with Captain Ahab.\\nBut nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa?--heard nothing about that, eh?\\nNothing about the silver calabash he spat into?\\nAnd nothing about his losing his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy.\\nDidn\\'t ye hear a word about them matters and something more, eh?\\nNo, I don\\'t think ye did; how could ye?\\nWho knows it?\\nNot all Nantucket, I guess.\\nBut hows\\'ever, mayhap, ye\\'ve heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.\\nOh yes, THAT every one knows a\\'most--I mean they know he\\'s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.\"\\n\"My friend.\"\\nsaid I, \"what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t much care; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head.\\nBut if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of his leg.\"\\n\"ALL about it, eh--sure you do?--all?\"\\n\"Pretty sure.\"\\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little, turned and said:--\"Ye\\'ve shipped, have ye?\\nNames down on the papers?\\nWell, well, what\\'s signed, is signed; and what\\'s to be, will be; and then again, perhaps it won\\'t be, after all.\\nAnyhow, it\\'s all fixed and arranged a\\'ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity \\'em!\\nMorning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I\\'m sorry I stopped ye.\"\\n\"Look here, friend.\"\\nsaid I, \"if you have anything important to tell us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game; that\\'s all I have to say.\"\\n\"And it\\'s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you are just the man for him--the likes of ye.\\nMorning to ye, shipmates, morning!\\nOh!\\nwhen ye get there, tell \\'em I\\'ve concluded not to make one of \\'em.\"\\n\"Ah, my dear fellow, you can\\'t fool us that way--you can\\'t fool us.\\nIt is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him.\"\\n\"Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.\"\\n\"Morning it is.\"\\nsaid I.\\n\"Come along, Queequeg, let\\'s leave this crazy man.\\nBut stop, tell me your name, will you?\"\\n\"Elijah.\"\\nElijah!\\nthought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other\\'s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear.\\nBut we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance.\\nSomehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did.\\nHe did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine.\\nThis circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.\\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.\\nBut Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us.\\nThis relieved me; and once more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.\\nAll Astir.\\nA day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.\\nNot only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened that the ship\\'s preparations were hurrying to a close.\\nCaptain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.\\nOn the day following Queequeg\\'s signing the articles, word was given at all the inns where the ship\\'s company were stopping, that their chests must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing.\\nSo Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last.\\nBut it seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days.\\nBut no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod was fully equipped.\\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are indispensable to the business of housekeeping.\\nJust so with whaling, which necessitates a three-years\\' housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers.\\nAnd though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen.\\nFor besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.\\nHence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate ship.\\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves.\\nBut, as before hinted, for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.\\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad\\'s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if SHE could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea.\\nAt one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward\\'s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate\\'s desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one\\'s rheumatic back.\\nNever did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.\\nAnd like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.\\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer whaling lance in the other.\\nNor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward.\\nAs for Bildad, he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper.\\nEvery once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was going to come on board his ship.\\nTo these questions they would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage.\\nIf I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea.\\nBut when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.\\nAnd much this way it was with me.\\nI said nothing, and tried to think nothing.\\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail.\\nSo next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.\\nGoing Aboard.\\nIt was nearly six o\\'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we drew nigh the wharf.\\n\"There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right.\"\\nsaid I to Queequeg, \"it can\\'t be shadows; she\\'s off by sunrise, I guess; come on.\"\\n\"Avast.\"\\ncried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me.\\nIt was Elijah.\\n\"Going aboard?\"\\n\"Hands off, will you.\"\\nsaid I.\\n\"Lookee here.\"\\nsaid Queequeg, shaking himself, \"go \\'way.\"\\n\"Ain\\'t going aboard, then?\"\\n\"Yes, we are.\"\\nsaid I, \"but what business is that of yours?\\nDo you know, Mr.\\nElijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?\"\\n\"No, no, no; I wasn\\'t aware of that.\"\\nsaid Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.\\n\"Elijah.\"\\nsaid I, \"you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.\\nWe are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be detained.\"\\n\"Ye be, be ye?\\nComing back afore breakfast?\"\\n\"He\\'s cracked, Queequeg.\"\\nsaid I, \"come on.\"\\n\"Holloa.\"\\ncried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few paces.\\n\"Never mind him.\"\\nsaid I, \"Queequeg, come on.\"\\nBut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder, said--\"Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?\"\\nStruck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, \"Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.\"\\n\"Very dim, very dim.\"\\nsaid Elijah.\\n\"Morning to ye.\"\\nOnce more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and touching my shoulder again, said, \"See if you can find \\'em now, will ye?\\n\"Find who?\"\\n\"Morning to ye!\\nmorning to ye.\"\\nhe rejoined, again moving off.\\n\"Oh!\\nI was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it\\'s all one, all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain\\'t it?\\nGood-bye to ye.\\nShan\\'t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it\\'s before the Grand Jury.\"\\nAnd with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.\\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound quiet, not a soul moving.\\nThe cabin entrance was locked within; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.\\nGoing forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open.\\nSeeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.\\nHe was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms.\\nThe profoundest slumber slept upon him.\\n\"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\"\\nsaid I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.\\nBut it seemed that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for Elijah\\'s otherwise inexplicable question.\\nBut I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish himself accordingly.\\nHe put his hand upon the sleeper\\'s rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.\\n\"Gracious!\\nQueequeg, don\\'t sit there.\"\\nsaid I.\\n\"Oh!\\nperry dood seat.\"\\nsaid Queequeg, \"my country way; won\\'t hurt him face.\"\\n\"Face.\"\\nsaid I, \"call that his face?\\nvery benevolent countenance then; but how hard he breathes, he\\'s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you are heavy, it\\'s grinding the face of the poor.\\nGet off, Queequeg!\\nLook, he\\'ll twitch you off soon.\\nI wonder he don\\'t wake.\"\\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and lighted his tomahawk pipe.\\nI sat at the feet.\\nWe kept the pipe passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.\\nMeanwhile, upon questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves.\\nBesides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.\\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper\\'s head.\\n\"What\\'s that for, Queequeg?\"\\n\"Perry easy, kill-e; oh!\\nperry easy.\"\\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe, which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger.\\nThe strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him.\\nHe breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes.\\n\"Holloa.\"\\nhe breathed at last, \"who be ye smokers?\"\\n\"Shipped men.\"\\nanswered I, \"when does she sail?\"\\n\"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye?\\nShe sails to-day.\\nThe Captain came aboard last night.\"\\n\"What Captain?--Ahab?\"\\n\"Who but him indeed?\"\\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we heard a noise on deck.\\n\"Holloa!\\nStarbuck\\'s astir.\"\\nsaid the rigger.\\n\"He\\'s a lively chief mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.\"\\nAnd so saying he went on deck, and we followed.\\nIt was now clear sunrise.\\nSoon the crew came on board in twos and threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board.\\nMeanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin.\\nMerry Christmas.\\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship\\'s riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift--a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward--after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:  \"Now, Mr.\\nStarbuck, are you sure everything is right?\\nCaptain Ahab is all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore, eh?\\nWell, call all hands, then.\\nMuster \\'em aft here--blast \\'em.\"\\n\"No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg.\"\\nsaid Bildad, \"but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.\"\\nHow now!\\nHere upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port.\\nAnd, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin.\\nBut then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.\\nIndeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot\\'s; and as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below.\\nAnd all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.\\nBut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg was now all alive.\\nHe seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and not Bildad.\\n\"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors.\"\\nhe cried, as the sailors lingered at the main-mast.\\n\"Mr.\\nStarbuck, drive\\'em aft.\"\\n\"Strike the tent there!\"--was the next order.\\nAs I hinted before, this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\\n\"Man the capstan!\\nBlood and thunder!--jump!\"--was the next command, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.\\nNow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship.\\nAnd here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots of the port--he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft--Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will.\\nNevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman\\'s berth.\\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner.\\nI almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot.\\nI was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity.\\nThat was my first kick.\\n\"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?\"\\nhe roared.\\n\"Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone!\\nWhy don\\'t ye spring, I say, all of ye--spring!\\nQuohog!\\nspring, thou chap with the red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants.\\nSpring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out.\"\\nAnd so saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.\\nThinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.\\nIt was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.\\nThe long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.\\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were heard,--  \"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living green.\\nSo to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.\"\\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.\\nThey were full of hope and fruition.\\nSpite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\\nAt last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no longer.\\nThe stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside.\\nIt was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.\\nFor loath to depart, yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage--beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,--poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say, \"Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.\"\\nAs for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came too near.\\nAnd he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck--now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.\\nBut, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about him,--\"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go.\\nBack the main-yard there!\\nBoat ahoy!\\nStand by to come close alongside, now!\\nCareful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--say your last.\\nLuck to ye, Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr.\\nStubb--luck to ye, Mr.\\nFlask--good-bye and good luck to ye all--and this day three years I\\'ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket.\\nHurrah and away.\"\\n\"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men.\"\\nmurmured old Bildad, almost incoherently.\\n\"I hope ye\\'ll have fine weather now, so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all he needs, and ye\\'ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.\\nBe careful in the hunt, ye mates.\\nDon\\'t stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.\\nwithin the year.\\nDon\\'t forget your prayers, either.\\nMr.\\nStarbuck, mind that cooper don\\'t waste the spare staves.\\nOh!\\nthe sail-needles are in the green locker!\\nDon\\'t whale it too much a\\' Lord\\'s days, men; but don\\'t miss a fair chance either, that\\'s rejecting Heaven\\'s good gifts.\\nHave an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr.\\nStubb; it was a little leaky, I thought.\\nIf ye touch at the islands, Mr.\\nFlask, beware of fornication.\\nGood-bye, good-bye!\\nDon\\'t keep that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr.\\nStarbuck; it\\'ll spoil.\\nBe careful with the butter--twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if-.\"\\n\"Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,--away.\"\\nand with that, Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.\\nShip and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic.\\nThe Lee Shore.\\nSome chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.\\nWhen on that shivering winter\\'s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington!\\nI looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years\\' dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term.\\nThe land seemed scorching to his feet.\\nWonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington.\\nLet me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land.\\nThe port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that\\'s kind to our mortalities.\\nBut in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship\\'s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through.\\nWith all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights \\'gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea\\'s landlessness again; for refuge\\'s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\\nKnow ye now, Bulkington?\\nGlimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?\\nBut as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God--so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!\\nFor worm-like, then, oh!\\nwho would craven crawl to land!\\nTerrors of the terrible!\\nis all this agony so vain?\\nTake heart, take heart, O Bulkington!\\nBear thee grimly, demigod!\\nUp from the spray of thy ocean-perishing--straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\\nThe Advocate.\\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.\\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions.\\nIf a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F.\\n(Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.\\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements.\\nButchers we are, that is true.\\nBut butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour.\\nAnd as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth.\\nBut even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies\\' plaudits?\\nAnd if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier\\'s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale\\'s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head.\\nFor what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God!\\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration!\\nfor almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!\\nBut look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.\\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt\\'s time have admirals of their whaling fleets?\\nWhy did Louis XVI.\\nof France, at his own personal expense, fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket?\\nWhy did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of L1,000,000?\\nAnd lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000!\\nand every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000.\\nHow comes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?\\nBut this is not the half; look again.\\nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life, point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling.\\nOne way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb.\\nIt would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue all these things.\\nLet a handful suffice.\\nFor many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth.\\nShe has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed.\\nIf American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.\\nThey may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.\\nFor in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared.\\nAll that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers.\\nOften, adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship\\'s common log.\\nAh, the world!\\nOh, the world!\\nUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial, scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast.\\nIt was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.\\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman.\\nAfter its first blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there.\\nThe whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.\\nMoreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.\\nThe uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations.\\nIf that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.\\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time.\\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will say.\\nTHE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER?\\nWho wrote the first account of our Leviathan?\\nWho but mighty Job!\\nAnd who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage?\\nWho, but no less a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times!\\nAnd who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament?\\nWho, but Edmund Burke!\\nTrue enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no good blood in their veins.\\nNO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS?\\nThey have something better than royal blood there.\\nThe grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers--all kith and kin to noble Benjamin--this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.\\nGood again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.\\nWHALING NOT RESPECTABLE?\\nWhaling is imperial!\\nBy old English statutory law, the whale is declared \"a royal fish.\"*  Oh, that\\'s only nominal!\\nThe whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way.\\nTHE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY?\\nIn one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world\\'s capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*   *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.\\nGrant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real dignity in whaling.\\nNO DIGNITY IN WHALING?\\nThe dignity of our calling the very heavens attest.\\nCetus is a constellation in the South!\\nNo more!\\nDrive down your hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg!\\nNo more!\\nI know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales.\\nI account that man more honourable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.\\nAnd, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather have done than to have left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS.\\nin my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.\\nPostscript.\\nIn behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts.\\nBut after embattling his facts, an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell eloquently upon his cause--such an advocate, would he not be blameworthy?\\nIt is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through.\\nThere is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be a castor of state.\\nHow they use the salt, precisely--who knows?\\nCertain I am, however, that a king\\'s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad.\\nCan it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery?\\nMuch might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing.\\nIn truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.\\nAs a general rule, he can\\'t amount to much in his totality.\\nBut the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil is used at coronations?\\nCertainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear\\'s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.\\nWhat then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?\\nThink of that, ye loyal Britons!\\nwe whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff!\\nKnights and Squires.\\nThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent.\\nHe was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit.\\nTransported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale.\\nHe must have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous.\\nOnly some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness.\\nBut this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight.\\nIt was merely the condensation of the man.\\nHe was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.\\nHis pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates.\\nLooking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life.\\nA staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds.\\nYet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.\\nUncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.\\nOutward portents and inward presentiments were his.\\nAnd if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.\\n\"I will have no man in my boat.\"\\nsaid Starbuck, \"who is not afraid of a whale.\"\\nBy this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.\\n\"Aye, aye.\"\\nsaid Stubb, the second mate, \"Starbuck, there, is as careful a man as you\\'ll find anywhere in this fishery.\"\\nBut we shall ere long see what that word \"carefu.\"\\nprecisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions.\\nBesides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted.\\nWherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him.\\nFor, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.\\nWhat doom was his own father\\'s?\\nWhere, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?\\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme.\\nBut it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.\\nAnd brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.\\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete abasement of poor Starbuck\\'s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of valour in the soul.\\nMen may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.\\nThat immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man.\\nNor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars.\\nBut this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture.\\nThou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself!\\nThe great God absolute!\\nThe centre and circumference of all democracy!\\nHis omnipresence, our divine equality!\\nIf, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch that workman\\'s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics bear me out in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind!\\nBear me out in it, thou great democratic God!\\nwho didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne!\\nThou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!\\nKnights and Squires.\\nStubb was the second mate.\\nHe was a native of Cape Cod; and hence, according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man.\\nA happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year.\\nGood-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited guests.\\nHe was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box.\\nWhen close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.\\nHe would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster.\\nLong usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair.\\nWhat he thought of death itself, there is no telling.\\nWhether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.\\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have been his pipe.\\nFor, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.\\nYou would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe.\\nHe kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in readiness anew.\\nFor, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.\\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb\\'s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.\\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha\\'s Vineyard.\\nA short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him, to destroy them whenever encountered.\\nSo utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil.\\nThis ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years\\' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time.\\nAs a carpenter\\'s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.\\nLittle Flask was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.\\nThey called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas.\\nNow these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.\\nThey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod\\'s boats as headsmen.\\nIn that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies.\\nOr, being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.\\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set down who the Pequod\\'s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of them belonged.\\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for his squire.\\nBut Queequeg is already known.\\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly promontory of Martha\\'s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers.\\nIn the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers.\\nTashtego\\'s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.\\nBut no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires.\\nTo look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.\\nTashtego was Stubb the second mate\\'s squire.\\nThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.\\nSuspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them.\\nIn his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast.\\nAnd never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks.\\nThere was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress.\\nCurious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him.\\nAs for the residue of the Pequod\\'s company, be it said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the officers are.\\nHerein it is the same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and Railroads.\\nThe same, I say, because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles.\\nNo small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.\\nIn like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew.\\nUpon the passage homewards, they drop them there again.\\nHow it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen.\\nThey were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, ISOLATOES too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own.\\nYet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!\\nAn Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world\\'s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back.\\nBlack Little Pip--he never did--oh, no!\\nhe went before.\\nPoor Alabama boy!\\nOn the grim Pequod\\'s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!\\nAhab.\\nFor several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab.\\nThe mates regularly relieved each other at the watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.\\nYes, their supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, became almost a perturbation.\\nThis was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah\\'s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of.\\nBut poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.\\nBut whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness--to call it so--which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions.\\nFor though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed this--and rightly ascribed it--to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked.\\nBut it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.\\nThree better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man.\\nNow, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind us.\\nIt was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.\\nReality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.\\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the recovery from any.\\nHe looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness.\\nHis whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini\\'s cast Perseus.\\nThreading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish.\\nIt resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.\\nWhether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.\\nBy some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates.\\nBut once Tashtego\\'s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea.\\nYet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab.\\nNevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment.\\nSo that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.\\nIt had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale\\'s jaw.\\n\"Aye, he was dismasted off Japan.\"\\nsaid the old Gay-Head Indian once; \"but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for it.\\nHe has a quiver of \\'em.\"\\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained.\\nUpon each side of the Pequod\\'s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank.\\nHis bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship\\'s ever-pitching prow.\\nThere was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.\\nNot a word he spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.\\nAnd not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.\\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\\nBut after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking the deck.\\nAs the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.\\nAnd, by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.\\nBut the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood.\\nFor, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air.\\nMore than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.\\nEnter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.\\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic.\\nThe warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up--flaked up, with rose-water snow.\\nThe starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns!\\nFor sleeping man, \\'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights.\\nBut all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world.\\nInward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.\\nAnd all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab\\'s texture.\\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with aught that looks like death.\\nAmong sea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck.\\nIt was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks.\\n\"It feels like going down into one\\'s tomb,\"--he would mutter to himself--\"for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.\"\\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way.\\nSome considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks.\\nBut once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the ivory heel.\\nAh!\\nStubb, thou didst not know Ahab then.\\n\"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb.\"\\nsaid Ahab, \"that thou wouldst wad me that fashion?\\nBut go thy ways; I had forgot.\\nBelow to thy nightly grave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.--Down, dog, and kennel.\"\\nStarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, \"I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like it, sir.\"\\n\"Avast!\\ngritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.\\n\"No, sir; not yet.\"\\nsaid Stubb, emboldened, \"I will not tamely be called a dog, sir.\"\\n\"Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or I\\'ll clear the world of thee.\"\\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\\n\"I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it.\"\\nmuttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.\\n\"It\\'s very queer.\\nStop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don\\'t well know whether to go back and strike him, or--what\\'s that?--down here on my knees and pray for him?\\nYes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time I ever DID pray.\\nIt\\'s queer; very queer; and he\\'s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he\\'s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with.\\nHow he flashed at me!--his eyes like powder-pans!\\nis he mad?\\nAnyway there\\'s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.\\nHe aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don\\'t sleep then.\\nDidn\\'t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man\\'s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it?\\nA hot old man!\\nI guess he\\'s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it\\'s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say--worse nor a toothache.\\nWell, well; I don\\'t know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it.\\nHe\\'s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what\\'s that for, I should like to know?\\nWho\\'s made appointments with him in the hold?\\nAin\\'t that queer, now?\\nBut there\\'s no telling, it\\'s the old game--Here goes for a snooze.\\nDamn me, it\\'s worth a fellow\\'s while to be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep.\\nAnd now that I think of it, that\\'s about the first thing babies do, and that\\'s a sort of queer, too.\\nDamn me, but all things are queer, come to think of \\'em.\\nBut that\\'s against my principles.\\nThink not, is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes again.\\nBut how\\'s that?\\ndidn\\'t he call me a dog?\\nblazes!\\nhe called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT!\\nHe might as well have kicked me, and done with it.\\nMaybe he DID kick me, and I didn\\'t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow.\\nIt flashed like a bleached bone.\\nWhat the devil\\'s the matter with me?\\nI don\\'t stand right on my legs.\\nComing afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.\\nBy the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though--How?\\nhow?\\nhow?--but the only way\\'s to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the morning, I\\'ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight.\"\\nThe Pipe.\\nWhen Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe.\\nLighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.\\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.\\nHow could one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized?\\nFor a Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.\\nSome moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face.\\n\"How now.\"\\nhe soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, \"this smoking no longer soothes.\\nOh, my pipe!\\nhard must it go with me if thy charm be gone!\\nHere have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring--aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.\\nWhat business have I with this pipe?\\nThis thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine.\\nI\\'ll smoke no more-.\"\\nHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea.\\nThe fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made.\\nWith slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.\\nQueen Mab.\\nNext morning Stubb accosted Flask.\\n\"Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had.\\nYou know the old man\\'s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off!\\nAnd then, presto!\\nAhab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it.\\nBut what was still more curious, Flask--you know how curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.\\n\\'Why,\\' thinks I, \\'what\\'s the row?\\nIt\\'s not a real leg, only a false leg.\\' And there\\'s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump.\\nThat\\'s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.\\nThe living member--that makes the living insult, my little man.\\nAnd thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid--so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, \\'what\\'s his leg now, but a cane--a whalebone cane.\\nYes,\\' thinks I, \\'it was only a playful cudgelling--in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base kick.\\nBesides,\\' thinks I, \\'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot part--what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, THERE\\'S a devilish broad insult.\\nBut this insult is whittled down to a point only.\\' But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.\\nWhile I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.\\n\\'What are you \\'bout?\\' says he.\\nSlid!\\nman, but I was frightened.\\nSuch a phiz!\\nBut, somehow, next moment I was over the fright.\\n\\'What am I about?\\' says I at last.\\n\\'And what business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr.\\nHumpback?\\nDo YOU want a kick?\\' By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out.\\nSays I, on second thoughts, \\'I guess I won\\'t kick you, old fellow.\\' \\'Wise Stubb,\\' said he, \\'wise Stubb;\\' and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.\\nSeeing he wasn\\'t going to stop saying over his \\'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,\\' I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.\\nBut I had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, \\'Stop that kicking!\\' \\'Halloa,\\' says I, \\'what\\'s the matter now, old fellow?\\' \\'Look ye here,\\' says he; \\'let\\'s argue the insult.\\nCaptain Ahab kicked ye, didn\\'t he?\\' \\'Yes, he did,\\' says I--\\'right HERE it was.\\' \\'Very good,\\' says he--\\'he used his ivory leg, didn\\'t he?\\' \\'Yes, he did,\\' says I.\\n\\'Well then,\\' says he, \\'wise Stubb, what have you to complain of?\\nDidn\\'t he kick with right good will?\\nit wasn\\'t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it?\\nNo, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.\\nIt\\'s an honour; I consider it an honour.\\nListen, wise Stubb.\\nIn old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of.\\nRemember what I say; BE kicked by him; account his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you can\\'t help yourself, wise Stubb.\\nDon\\'t you see that pyramid?\\' With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the air.\\nI snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock!\\nNow, what do you think of that dream, Flask?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho..\"\\n\"May be; may be.\\nBut it\\'s made a wise man of me, Flask.\\nD\\'ye see Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern?\\nWell, the best thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever he says.\\nHalloa!\\nWhat\\'s that he shouts?\\nHark.\"\\n\"Mast-head, there!\\nLook sharp, all of ye!\\nThere are whales hereabouts!\\n\"If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\\n\"What do you think of that now, Flask?\\nain\\'t there a small drop of something queer about that, eh?\\nA white whale--did ye mark that, man?\\nLook ye--there\\'s something special in the wind.\\nStand by for it, Flask.\\nAhab has that that\\'s bloody on his mind.\\nBut, mum; he comes this way.\"\\nCetology.\\nAlready we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities.\\nEre that come to pass; ere the Pequod\\'s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.\\nIt is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I would now fain put before you.\\nYet is it no easy task.\\nThe classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed.\\nListen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.\\n\"No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology.\"\\nsays Captain Scoresby, A.D.\\n1820.\\n\"It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families....\\nUtter confusion exists among the historians of this anima.\"\\n(sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D.\\n1839.\\n\"Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.\"\\n\"Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.\"\\n\"A field strewn with thorns.\"\\n\"All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.\"\\nThus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy.\\nNevertheless, though of real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales.\\nMany are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale.\\nRun over a few:--The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J.\\nRoss Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev.\\nT.\\nCheever.\\nBut to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will show.\\nOf the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman.\\nI mean Captain Scoresby.\\nOn the separate subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority.\\nBut Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning.\\nAnd here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.\\nHe is not even by any means the largest of the whales.\\nYet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete.\\nReference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.\\nBut the time has at last come for a new proclamation.\\nThis is Charing Cross; hear ye!\\ngood people all,--the Greenland whale is deposed,--the great sperm whale now reigneth!\\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt.\\nThose books are Beale\\'s and Bennett\\'s; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men.\\nThe original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description.\\nAs yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature.\\nFar above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.\\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers.\\nAs no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors.\\nI promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty.\\nI shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species, or--in this place at least--to much of any description.\\nMy object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology.\\nI am the architect, not the builder.\\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is equal to it.\\nTo grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to have one\\'s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing.\\nWhat am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan!\\nThe awful tauntings in Job might well appal me.\\nWill he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee?\\nBehold the hope of him is vain!\\nBut I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try.\\nThere are some preliminaries to settle.\\nFirst: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.\\nIn his System of Nature, A.D.\\n1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate the whales from the fish.\"\\nBut of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus\\'s express edict, were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.\\nThe grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem.\"\\nand finally, \"ex lege naturae jure meritoque.\"\\nI submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient.\\nCharley profanely hinted they were humbug.\\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\\nThis fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish.\\nAbove, Linnaeus has given you those items.\\nBut in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come?\\nTo be short, then, a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.\\nThere you have him.\\nHowever contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.\\nA walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious.\\nBut the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.\\nAlmost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.\\nWhereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.\\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.\\nNow, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.\\n*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales.\\nBut as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\\nI.\\nTHE FOLIO WHALE; II.\\nthe OCTAVO WHALE; III.\\nthe DUODECIMO WHALE.\\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO, the GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE.\\nFOLIOS.\\nAmong these I here include the following chapters:--I.\\nThe SPERM WHALE; II.\\nthe RIGHT WHALE; III.\\nthe FIN-BACK WHALE; IV.\\nthe HUMP-BACKED WHALE; V.\\nthe RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI.\\nthe SULPHUR-BOTTOM WHALE.\\nBOOK I.\\n(SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words.\\nHe is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained.\\nAll his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon.\\nIt is chiefly with his name that I now have to do.\\nPhilologically considered, it is absurd.\\nSome centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale.\\nIt was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses.\\nIn those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.\\nIt was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb.\\nWhen, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity.\\nAnd so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.\\nBOOK I.\\n(RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by man.\\nIt yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially known as \"whale oil.\"\\nan inferior article in commerce.\\nAmong the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale.\\nThere is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised.\\nWhat then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios?\\nIt is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes.\\nIt is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor\\' West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.\\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans.\\nBut they precisely agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction.\\nIt is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.\\nThe right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.\\nBOOK I.\\n(FIN-BACK).--Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.\\nIn the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive.\\nHis great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.\\nHis grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object.\\nThis fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.\\nEven if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.\\nWhen the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it.\\nOn that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back.\\nThe Fin-Back is not gregarious.\\nHe seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters.\\nVery shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.\\nFrom having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES, that is, whales with baleen.\\nOf these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known.\\nBroad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen\\'s names for a few sorts.\\nIn connection with this appellative of \"Whalebone whales.\"\\nit is of great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.\\nHow then?\\nThe baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars.\\nThus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.\\nThen, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.\\nAnd it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned.\\nIn various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis.\\nOn this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.\\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification.\\nNay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale\\'s anatomy more striking than his baleen?\\nYet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale.\\nAnd if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated.\\nWhat then remains?\\nnothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.\\nAnd this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable.\\nTo proceed.\\nBOOK I.\\n(HUMP-BACK).--This whale is often seen on the northern American coast.\\nHe has been frequently captured there, and towed into harbor.\\nHe has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale.\\nAt any rate, the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one.\\nHis oil is not very valuable.\\nHe has baleen.\\nHe is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.\\nBOOK I.\\n(RAZOR-BACK).--Of this whale little is known but his name.\\nI have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn.\\nOf a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers.\\nThough no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long sharp ridge.\\nLet him go.\\nI know little more of him, nor does anybody else.\\nBOOK I.\\n(SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Another retiring gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings.\\nHe is seldom seen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance.\\nHe is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line.\\nProdigies are told of him.\\nAdieu, Sulphur Bottom!\\nI can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.\\nThus ends BOOK I.\\n(FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II.\\n(OCTAVO).\\nOCTAVOES.*--These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which present may be numbered:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH; III., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER.\\n*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.\\nBecause, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the bookbinder\\'s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.\\nBOOK II.\\n(GRAMPUS).--Though this fish, whose loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly classed among whales.\\nBut possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one.\\nHe is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist.\\nHe swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light.\\nBy some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.\\nBOOK II.\\n(BLACK FISH).--I give the popular fishermen\\'s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest another.\\nI do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales.\\nSo, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please.\\nHis voracity is well known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face.\\nThis whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length.\\nHe is found in almost all latitudes.\\nHe has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose.\\nWhen not more profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.\\nThough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.\\nBOOK II.\\n(NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL WHALE.--Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose.\\nThe creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet.\\nStrictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal.\\nBut it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man.\\nWhat precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say.\\nIt does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food.\\nCharley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through.\\nBut you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct.\\nMy own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.\\nThe Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale.\\nHe is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature.\\nFrom certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn\\'s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.\\nIt was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\\nOriginally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.\\nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; \"when Sir Martin returned from that voyage.\"\\nsaith Black Letter, \"on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.\"\\nAn Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.\\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.\\nHis oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted.\\nHe is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\\nBOOK II.\\n(KILLER).--Of this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed naturalist.\\nFrom what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus.\\nHe is very savage--a sort of Feegee fish.\\nHe sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.\\nThe Killer is never hunted.\\nI never heard what sort of oil he has.\\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness.\\nFor we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.\\nBOOK II.\\n(THRASHER).--This gentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.\\nHe mounts the Folio whale\\'s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process.\\nStill less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer.\\nBoth are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.\\nThus ends BOOK II.\\n(OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III.\\n(DUODECIMO).\\nDUODECIMOES.--These include the smaller whales.\\nI.\\nThe Huzza Porpoise.\\nII.\\nThe Algerine Porpoise.\\nIII.\\nThe Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES--a word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.\\nBut the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is--i.e.\\na spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.\\nBOOK III.\\n(HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe.\\nThe name is of my own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something must be done to distinguish them.\\nI call him thus, because he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd.\\nTheir appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner.\\nFull of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.\\nThey are the lads that always live before the wind.\\nThey are accounted a lucky omen.\\nIf you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.\\nA well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil.\\nBut the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable.\\nIt is in request among jewellers and watchmakers.\\nSailors put it on their hones.\\nPorpoise meat is good eating, you know.\\nIt may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts.\\nIndeed, his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible.\\nBut the next time you have a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.\\nBOOK III.\\n(ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pirate.\\nVery savage.\\nHe is only found, I think, in the Pacific.\\nHe is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.\\nProvoke him, and he will buckle to a shark.\\nI have lowered for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.\\nBOOK III.\\n(MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is known.\\nThe only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is that of the fishers--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio.\\nIn shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure.\\nHe has no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue.\\nBut his mealy-mouth spoils all.\\nThough his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship\\'s hull, called the \"bright waist.\"\\nthat line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.\\nThe white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag.\\nA most mean and mealy aspect!\\nHis oil is much like that of the common porpoise.\\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales.\\nAbove, you have all the Leviathans of note.\\nBut there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally.\\nI shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun.\\nIf any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc.\\nFrom Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names.\\nBut I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.\\nFinally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at once, perfected.\\nYou cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word.\\nBut I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.\\nFor small erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity.\\nGod keep me from ever completing anything.\\nThis whole book is but a draught--nay, but the draught of a draught.\\nOh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\\nThe Specksynder.\\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer\\'s vocation is evinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder.\\nLiterally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer.\\nIn those days, the captain\\'s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.\\nIn the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.\\nAt present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain\\'s more inferior subalterns.\\nNevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship\\'s deck is also his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this--the first lives aft, the last forward.\\nHence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship.\\nThat is to say, they take their meals in the captain\\'s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.\\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.\\nIndeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.\\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve.\\nThat certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.\\nFor be a man\\'s intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.\\nThis it is, that for ever keeps God\\'s true princes of the Empire from the world\\'s hustings; and leaves the highest honours that this air can give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.\\nSuch large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.\\nBut when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.\\nNor, will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now alluded to.\\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me.\\nOh, Ahab!\\nwhat shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!\\nThe Cabin-Table.\\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.\\nFrom his complete inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial.\\nBut presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, \"Dinner, Mr.\\nStarbuck.\"\\ndisappears into the cabin.\\nWhen the last echo of his sultan\\'s step has died away, and Starbuck, the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, \"Dinner, Mr.\\nStubb.\"\\nand descends the scuttle.\\nThe second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid \"Dinner, Mr.\\nFlask.\"\\nfollows after his predecessors.\\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck, seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk\\'s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.\\nBut ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab\\'s presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander\\'s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.\\nWherefore this difference?\\nA problem?\\nPerhaps not.\\nTo have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur.\\nBut he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that man\\'s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man\\'s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar\\'s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.\\nWho has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Caesar.\\nIt is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\\nNow, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs.\\nIn his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served.\\nThey were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.\\nWith one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man\\'s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him.\\nI do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.\\nNo!\\nAnd when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck\\'s plate towards him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection.\\nFor, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb.\\nWhat a relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.\\nAnd poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family party.\\nHis were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have been the drumsticks.\\nFor Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree.\\nHad he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.\\nAnd had Flask helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\\nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.\\nWhether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!\\nwas a butterless man!\\nAnother thing.\\nFlask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is the first man up.\\nConsider!\\nFor hereby Flask\\'s dinner was badly jammed in point of time.\\nStarbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.'"
